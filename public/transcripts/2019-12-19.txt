Hearing no objections, do I have a motion to move the approval of the minutes? Alderman Lopez moves, makes the motion. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? Opinion chair, the ayes have.

The report has been approved. Now we're moving on. We'll hear the items to be deferred.

Opinion of the chair, the ayes have it and these items are deferred. Now we'll move to the public comment period. Out of respect for everyone's time, each speaker is limited to three minutes to address all items on the agenda.

This will be the only opportunity to address the items on the agenda and the committee will not conduct separate public comment before each agenda item. I don't think we have too many today. Again, if you need to fill out a white slip, make sure you get it down to us.

Okay. With that being said, I have Alan Mellis to speak this morning in favor of 2604 North Sheffield, Alan.

[Speaker 33] (5:24 - 5:24)
Good morning.

[Speaker 1] (5:25 - 5:26)
Good morning, sir.

[Speaker 33] (5:26 - 6:37)
Morning Tom. I am Alan Mellis, a community leader for 45 years speaking today representing our local neighborhood association, Rightwood Neighbors. We are in favor of the proposed CHA building to be constructed between the two existing senior housing buildings at 2604 to 2742 North Sheffield Avenue.

The renovation of the existing senior citizen buildings will include central air conditioning and improved heating system, which will be most welcome. The renovation will also be done without seniors needing to move to another location. The proposed design has been well thought out.

It includes having a new family building independent of the existing senior buildings, a new amenity spaces for all residents, addressing concerns about alley congestion, as well as being an attractive building. The thoughtful addition of these new affordable units will be a small start in increasing the number of significant affordable units already in our community. Thank you.

And I yield back the remainder of my time.

[Speaker 1] (6:37 - 9:22)
Thank you, Alan. And in our packets, we do have a written copy of your testimony. Thank you.

All right. Are there any other witnesses here on any of the agenda items? We don't, we do not have any other slips.

All right. Well, that, that will conclude the public commentary portion of the meeting. And now we'll move on to the addendum to the agenda.

And that is, we'll start with a large signs over a hundred square feet in area, 24 feet above grade. We'll hear them all together. I will read the ward followed by the address and take a motion at the end.

All right. In the 24th ward, 3860 West Ogden. Also in the 24th ward, 3812 West Ogden.

Again, in the 24th ward, two signs at 3750 West Ogden. And lastly, in the 41st ward, two signs at 10000 O'Hare airport. Questions from committee members?

Hearing no question. Can I get a motion to pass on the orders? Alderman Kerry Austin moves to pass on the orders.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

Can you ensure the ayes have it, the orders are passed and will be reported out at the December 18th city council meeting. And now we're moving on to the regular agenda and I believe we're going to go a little bit out of order. All right.

What page are we on? All right. And this is at the request of the attorney, not the alderman of the 44th ward.

So we're going to move to page 10, document number 20251. I'm sorry. The item number is 20251 in the 44th ward orders referred on November 13th of 19.

Change request B3 to community shopping district to a C2 to motor vehicle related commercial district. And, and at that, at this time, Alderman Beal, would you care since it's in my work? Call it up.

We're on the bottom of page 10.

[Speaker 11] (9:31 - 11:13)
Anyone soft Whacker I'm appearing this morning on behalf of the applicant, which is Med Mar L Lakeview LLC in connection with application 20251 this morning. Sitting next to me is Mr. Joseph Colabiano. There was the president of the applicant, the subject property that we're dealing with today has the address of 3524 North Clark and is currently zoned B3 dash two.

The applicant filed this application for a zoning amendment in order to reclassify the property, the C2 dash two, which is motor vehicle related commercial district. The subject property is improved with an existing commercial building in September of this year, we appeared before you when we were granted before the zoning board of appeals, and we're granted a special use to operate a medical cannabis dispensary at that location. And that was approved by the zoning board of appeals.

Shortly thereafter, the city of Chicago passed an ordinance that required with respect to adult cannabis dispensaries. And it said that an applicant would like in order to do that, you'd have to have property, not zone B3 dash two, but a commercial zoning. And so that's what we're seeking to do today is to change the zoning from the B3 dash two to the commercial zoning.

Uh, this is a matter that, uh, was heard. Uh, we met with Altman, um, honey, of course on this. Uh, it was approved by the ZBA with the understanding that when we do were to come in for us, uh, a medical cannabis license, we would have to have a special use, which we will be doing.

We appeared before the triangle neighbors association on this matter, as well as the Hawthorne neighbors association in the ward, both of those organizations unanimously approved this project. And we stand ready, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee to answer any questions that any of you might have concerning this project.

[Speaker 4] (11:14 - 11:21)
Any questions from the committee? Yes. Alderman Burnett.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So, so what is this organization?

[Speaker 11] (11:23 - 11:29)
It's MedMars, which is a company which presently has, uh, operates I should literally let Joe discuss these.

[Speaker 4] (11:29 - 11:30)
So MedMars or MedMans?

[Speaker 2] (11:31 - 11:32)
MedMars.

[Speaker 4] (11:34 - 11:35)
And who are the owners?

[Speaker 2] (11:36 - 12:02)
Sure. MedMars is, uh, acquired by Cresco labs, Inc. Cresco labs is an operator, uh, in the state of Illinois, uh, founded in 2013, uh, where we were awarded licenses in 2015, we employ approximately 1500 people across the country, uh, operate, uh, within 12 states and, uh, have been, uh, operating five dispensaries in the state of Illinois, as well as some in the city of Chicago since, uh, inception.

[Speaker 4] (12:02 - 12:12)
So you're one of the medical, you have a medical dispensary now? Correct. So you get to, you get to have recreational in your current medical facility?

[Speaker 2] (12:12 - 12:13)
Correct.

[Speaker 4] (12:13 - 12:15)
This is another facility or it's the same one?

[Speaker 2] (12:16 - 12:19)
This is the same one. They're becoming compliant.

[Speaker 4] (12:20 - 12:22)
Oh, we're trying to relocate. Upzone.

[Speaker 2] (12:22 - 12:24)
Sorry. Coming to upzone.

[Speaker 4] (12:26 - 12:34)
So, so I know Cresco has been doing a lot in the community, uh, going around. Yes.

[Speaker 2] (12:35 - 12:35)
Yes.

[Speaker 4] (12:35 - 12:38)
So we launched a lot of people on board with you guys. Yep.

[Speaker 2] (12:38 - 13:10)
So, you know, in, uh, when we started Cresco, um, you know, we, we have been a mission focused company from very early on, uh, focused on the medical aspects of cannabis and now as it's turned to, uh, a recreation on adult use, um, you know, we formed, uh, other initiatives called the seed initiative that has been designed to help, uh, the medical cannabis program. And with us, I brought Barrington Rutherford, Barrington runs our seed initiative and happy to answer any questions regarding, uh, the community involvement that Cresco has both on a city level, as well as a national level.

[Speaker 4] (13:10 - 13:13)
So Cresco is a national corporation?

[Speaker 2] (13:14 - 13:14)
Yes.

[Speaker 4] (13:14 - 13:15)
We also in Canada.

[Speaker 2] (13:16 - 13:39)
So we are a publicly traded company. Uh, we went public on December 3rd on the CSE, the Canadian securities exchange. Um, back on December 3rd of last year.

So about a year now with our headquarters in Chicago, um, uh, in order to go public in the cannabis space as US operator, you can't go public on the US exchanges. You must go public in the Canadian exchanges.

[Speaker 4] (13:39 - 13:45)
So you're a corporation. So you own, you're owned by your, uh, by your stockholders.

[Speaker 2] (13:46 - 13:48)
So we're owned by our stockholders. Absolutely.

[Speaker 4] (13:49 - 13:52)
And so you have a lot of stockholders.

[Speaker 2] (13:52 - 13:57)
Oh yeah. There's 300 million shares issued and traded in the public.

[Speaker 4] (14:00 - 14:08)
So, you know, we've been talking about trying to get minority partnerships. What's, what's, uh, Cresco's response to that?

[Speaker 2] (14:09 - 14:12)
Absolutely. Barrington, you want to comment on the seed initiative or any of the.

[Speaker 7] (14:12 - 15:24)
So I, my, again, my name is Barrington Rutherford. Um, I oversee the seed initiative for, for Cresco labs, uh, specifically around, um, minority ownership participation. Uh, we launched an incubator program, um, several months ago in which we have taken into, into our program, approximately 150, um, individuals that come from diverse backgrounds, um, that all meet the social equity requirements as set forth by the state adult use bill.

Um, these 150 individuals comprise about 35 or so ownership groups that will be applying for licensure in the coming days, but the, uh, the applications are due by January 2nd. So we have, um, helped them and supported them through writing their applications. We're not writing the applications for them, but rather teaching them our philosophy on how to win merit based applications in this industry.

Um, and it has so far been going phenomenally well. Um, we have representation from all over the city and even from some groups in other parts of the state.

[Speaker 4] (15:26 - 15:38)
So, so you, so you're helping, um, you're helping other folks to get licenses, but not with you, you're helping them to get licenses in the future somewhere else?

[Speaker 7] (15:39 - 15:59)
We're helping them to apply for licensure by, uh, in the upcoming state round, so the state of Illinois will be issuing 75 new dispensary licenses in 2020, and those applications are due January 2nd, so we're helping. That's for the ones in May, to open up in May, but not to open up.

[Speaker 4] (15:59 - 16:04)
So the license you're trying to get right now is to, is for a license in January.

[Speaker 2] (16:04 - 16:11)
Yeah, the license that we already have in place, it's owned by a publicly traded company, um, that is, we're, we're trying.

[Speaker 10] (16:11 - 16:12)
State your name before you speak, please.

[Speaker 2] (16:12 - 16:45)
I'm sorry, uh, Joe Caltabiano. Um, the license that we're talking about today is for the upzoning of a property that has been in the public domain, been operating, uh, but to meet future zoning state needs of upzone, so that entity that's owned by a public corporation that anyone can buy shares in and anyone's welcome to purchase shares in, um, in accordance with, with rules and regulations governed by Canadian Securities Exchange and the SEC, as well as the state of Illinois, uh, they're welcome to purchase shares in Cresco Labs at market value as, as required.

[Speaker 4] (16:47 - 16:53)
So could a public traded company partner with somewhere? Could a public traded company partner with another company?

[Speaker 2] (16:55 - 17:03)
Uh, I, I would, I would defer to my legal attorneys on what, what that means and what's allowed under the state laws as well as the federal laws.

[Speaker 4] (17:05 - 17:06)
That attorney?

[Speaker 11] (17:07 - 17:13)
No, Alderman, it's not me. I don't know the answer to the question, but we can find out for you, Alderman.

[Speaker 4] (17:13 - 17:15)
George is brilliant, but not in that field. Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 7] (17:19 - 17:20)
Barrington Rutherford.

[Speaker 4] (17:21 - 17:36)
So we need to get this out of the way cause, cause there's going to be several guys coming up here like this, um, throughout the areas and, uh, we need to, we need to be able to understand and, and also, um, see what and why.

[Speaker 7] (17:37 - 19:12)
So state law has some limitations on what the existing, uh, what the incumbent medical operator can, can own as well as, um, and so that also impacts the incumbent medical operator's ability to, um, be principal officers in another, in another company's, um, operation, another company's business, right? So, um, there are some limitations and I'm not an attorney. I, I, I'm not the governance lawyer, but I will say that, um, I think that our goal has been to, since we initiated the SEED initiative, um, our goal has been to support a more diverse group of, um, we, our goal is to create opportunity for more people in this industry, like very simply, um, we, we want to create opportunities on ramps into this industry for people of, of all backgrounds, for people, for anyone who wants to participate. And so one of those on ramps is through entrepreneurship, through ownership.

And so whether, whether we are allowed to, um, have an ownership interest, have a sort of partnership interest with another group or not, we, we've certainly made a commitment to the groups that we are incubating in our program. So all 35 of those, we've made a commitment to help them through the application process and if they are awarded licenses, a further commitment to provide capital and technical assistance to get them up and operational and to ensure their success along, on.

[Speaker 4] (19:12 - 19:19)
So when you provide capital, you'll just be giving it to them. You'll have a partnership. It'd be a loan.

How would that work?

[Speaker 7] (19:19 - 19:33)
I'm not exactly sure yet what the structure would be. We're working with the state, with the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity on the structure of how that would work, but. So before you became public, you say you just became public?

[Speaker 4] (19:33 - 19:38)
One year ago. So who owned your company before then?

[Speaker 2] (19:41 - 20:07)
You know, uh, there was, uh, I think 1,150 people, uh, who owned the company prior to that, 1,150 owners, correct. Investors, owners, we raised capital to get to where we are. We've raised in excess prior to going public.

We raised approximately $200 million. So a multitude of investors, a multitude of debt holders, a multitude of people have participated and helped Cresco become the company that it is today.

[Speaker 4] (20:07 - 20:09)
Do you know the makeup of that ownership?

[Speaker 2] (20:11 - 20:16)
Of all of the people? No, it's, uh, it's, I don't know.

[Speaker 4] (20:16 - 20:21)
Do you know the women, African-Americans, Latinos, white males?

[Speaker 2] (20:21 - 20:31)
It's a broad, diverse, and we open it up to a multitude of different investment vehicles, family offices. Um, there were certainly requirements as it relates to investing in a high risk situation.

[Speaker 4] (20:32 - 20:35)
Who was the head person that started it and got everybody to pitch in?

[Speaker 2] (20:35 - 20:39)
So myself and four partners founded Cresco Labs back in 2013.

[Speaker 4] (20:39 - 20:45)
And you don't know who all, what's the makeup of the people who donated to you to open up your business?

[Speaker 2] (20:46 - 21:04)
I, I know some of the people, but again, you're talking about thousands of people who've participated in the investment ranging from a wide diverse of, of, uh, everything, men, women, different races, different religions, different everybody. It's not a question that we ask on our questionnaire. It's everyone was welcome.

Who's a qualified investor.

[Speaker 4] (21:05 - 21:25)
So when you open up in other areas, um, when you open up in other areas, did you do with the seed program in those other areas, or are you just starting to do the seed program here? So the seed program was launched approximately two years ago. And you started that where?

[Speaker 2] (21:25 - 24:21)
So it started in Illinois. Okay. And we've done, so the seed program, some of the other things that we should talk about, the social equity and restorative justice, our social equity program is focused on community investment and partnership to create pathways for citizens, communities, negatively impacted by the war on drugs.

And it's legacy sponsoring expungement programs is one of the methods that Cresco will continue to employ. A few key examples, a joint expungement event, uh, with get cleared Chicago teamwork, where we 77 attendees were provided free expungement services. Cresco contributed to the participants, um, in obtaining the rap sheets, transportation to, and from the event in participation with the Solomon group.

We sponsored 50 individuals with free expungement services. We're also committed to other two expungement events. Uh, this year we've also, uh, uh, planning expungement fair in partnership with Kennedy King college and alpha Kappa alpha sorority with the goal of providing expungement services to another 300 individuals.

Again, Barrington mentioned the incubator program, um, you know, our workforce development education program partnership with higher education institutions, we're developing curriculum and courses, uh, to provide pathways of employment in the cannabis industry, including students, uh, uh, who are newly eligible for employment through expungement can learn from a business from agriculture to entrepreneurship and take advantage of opportunities with, uh, internships and scholarships. We've partnered with Chicago state university and grow mentum labs, a cannabis accelerator serving social equity entrepreneurs and advancing social equity in Chicago cannabis. Uh, we're finalizing partnership with, uh, Maureen Valley community college to launch certificate non-degree seeking programs in 2020.

Uh, since 2018, we've contributed more than 1.5 million in scholarship and fundraising support. A few examples of these activities include Caprini green legal aid, Gala sponsor, Susan Coleman year end, uh, campaign kickoff, Phoenix food drive, Vietnam era recognition program, national ovarian cancer coalition, Illinois marathon, Northern Illinois food bank, Illinois women in cannabis, Chicago marathon, urban sweet corn, Urbana sweet corn festival, Englewood Montessori graduation, um, women in cannabis events, uh, our education and awareness programs, uh, they provide existing and future patients and cut consumers well-informed, comfortable, and positive about their experiences with cannabis. We're excited to partner with Chicago normal on the release of know your rights education cards to help the public and law enforcement better understand adult use consumer responsibility rules. Uh, a few examples of other sponsorship events we've done are Phoenix botanical info days, can a learn series, fibromyalgia support group, ask the pharmacist, comprehensive cancer management, lunch and learn is cannabis right for you.

Palliative care education series as support group and alternative to opiates, the nopioid awareness campaign launch, neurobalance education event.

[Speaker 4] (24:21 - 24:29)
I think we get it. So tell me this. So tell me this.

So you're open up in other cities. You open up another state.

[Speaker 38] (24:29 - 24:29)
Yes.

[Speaker 4] (24:29 - 24:36)
We operate in 12 states. You have any African-American or minority partners in those states? Do we have partners?

[Speaker 2] (24:37 - 24:41)
We have, we were a publicly traded company, so we don't, we don't have partnerships, we're owned by shareholders.

[Speaker 4] (24:41 - 25:15)
So I understand that you understand that. Um, it seemed like you're very cognizant of the fact that we're concerned about that, right? And we've done a lot.

Because if you weren't cognizant about that, you wouldn't read all of those things. You wouldn't have an African-American guy sitting right there, right? You wouldn't be talking about your seed program.

So if you're cognizant of that, why don't you know if you have African-Americans invested in your company, or if you had any African-American partners in the first place? Why you don't know that? You don't know that you get all these people invested, but you don't know the makeup of the people who work for you, but you're very cognizant of it now.

[Speaker 2] (25:15 - 26:10)
Sir, respectfully, four people started the company. All of us were white males. This was a medical campus program that started.

Barrington sitting to the right of me does own shares in Cresco labs, and I can 100% assure you other African-Americans own shares in Cresco labs. If that's your question. I can 100% assure you that women own shares in Cresco labs.

I can 100% assure you that we are a socially conscious company and do things to help progress the cannabis program, both in the state of Illinois, as well as the United States of America. So we are very active. We are on a multitude of boards.

We are doing things to help improve this program. The state laws that existed prior had very specific goals. The new state laws have very specific goals, and we are focused and competent in engaging and improving the cannabis industry as a whole.

So what we're in front of you for is to upzone a current property that has been in operation.

[Speaker 4] (26:11 - 26:17)
I know what you're here for. So, so when you opened up in those other cities, did you have any partners?

[Speaker 2] (26:18 - 26:24)
We don't take on partners, sir. The company is a public company. So typically when you bring on partners, you say you just became public.

[Speaker 4] (26:25 - 26:31)
You say you just became public. You haven't been public all the time. We've been public for one year.

[Speaker 22] (26:31 - 26:32)
One year. Okay.

[Speaker 4] (26:32 - 26:39)
So when you open up in those other cities and those other states, did you have any other partners? No, we didn't.

[Speaker 2] (26:39 - 27:01)
We didn't partner with, we were a privately funded company. We went out and raised money from people who wanted to invest. We asked everybody, I needed money from anybody.

So anybody who wanted to participate in cannabis, whether they had capital, whether they had other resources to, to, to help better the company for our shareholders, we were welcoming every single person.

[Speaker 4] (27:01 - 27:19)
So have you bought out any companies? I bought Medmar. You bought Medmar?

Correct. Have you bought out any other companies? Yes.

We've done a multitude of M&A transactions throughout the course of our business. Were any of those African American companies that you bought out? I don't know.

African American oil companies.

[Speaker 2] (27:19 - 27:19)
I don't know.

[Speaker 4] (27:21 - 27:26)
You don't know. Were any of those companies, companies that you helped and you bought out?

[Speaker 2] (27:26 - 27:27)
No.

[Speaker 10] (27:35 - 27:42)
I got a couple of questions. Out of your 1500 employees, do you know what your makeup is as far as ethnicity?

[Speaker 2] (27:44 - 27:49)
I know that 35% of the employees are women. And then from a ethnic makeup, you have.

[Speaker 7] (27:50 - 29:12)
I don't. I don't know the, we don't have, the statistics on it do exist. I don't have them with me.

I will say that the cannabis industry writ large, as well as Cresco individually, has a diversity problem. We need to do better. We are doing better.

We certainly have a focus on attracting diverse candidates at every level of our organization. I think that my observation of being in this industry is that we are one of the most inclusive companies. I think that no matter how a person sort of self identifies, they, they find themselves represented at Cresco.

So in, and at every level, right? So we have, there are senior, senior executives. There are all the way to growers that are of a very, from very diverse background.

A lot depends on the state that we're in. Recruiting for cultivation in Pennsylvania is different from recruiting for cultivation in Arizona and will yield different results. But I think that there's a clear focus from our leadership, from our board, from our executive leadership and throughout the company on diversity and on social equity.

[Speaker 10] (29:12 - 29:20)
Okay. Do, was Illinois the first state that you all came in that had some type of social equity component?

[Speaker 7] (29:22 - 30:37)
Yes. Illinois was the, I'm sorry, probably not. So Illinois certainly has the most robust social equity provisions of, of any state that I'm aware of.

And, and I'm aware of all the ones that we work in. Certainly, Massachusetts and California also have social equity provisions in their law. But I think that, I think that any fair research of the, of the, the social equity in cannabis conversation would yield that everyone has struggled to create social equity programs that are actually effective.

I think that Illinois has, has done the best job so far, but of course it's early. The bill was, was, was passed just this year and signed later this year. And so these things are, are rolling out in Illinois, but I think that Illinois is poised, poised, I'm sorry, Illinois is poised to be the first state that's actually able to really deliver on the promise of issuing licenses to social equity applicants that then become operational and ultimately profitable.

[Speaker 10] (30:37 - 30:45)
If they have the capital and the means in order to be successful. And they're counting on people like you guys to help them along the way.

[Speaker 7] (30:46 - 31:46)
Yes. Counting on people like us, but also counting on the other things that the state has, has promised, right? So the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity has set aside a fund for, to help with small business loans.

We've met with departments here in the city, as well as the state who are looking to provide technical assistance. Capital is certainly one of the most important and one of the biggest obstacles to the entry in this industry, but it's not the only one. The burden of compliance with, in particularly in a state like Illinois, this heavily regulated compliance focused state, the burden of compliance is real.

And understanding the regulatory structure here and what it takes to be compliant with that regulatory structure at all times is not, is not easy.

[Speaker 2] (31:46 - 33:30)
What I would say is what Cresco has done since starting in 2013, this industry is very difficult. Federal moratoriums exist. Many public companies can't participate in the space, but what we've done and what we're trying to help is we've made a lot of mistakes along the way.

So whether it's different insurance companies that we work with, whether it's different law firms, whether it's different banks that we've opened doors to, the people that we help incubate will have access to all of those. All of the legal work provided, we work with our law firms to provide pro bono legal services, to help facilitate people writing good applications, being compliant, learning the ins and outs of this industry. But then also that the banks that we work with also participate with our applicants, the insurance providers that we work with, participate with our applicants, the bonds that you need to get.

All of those different things we have as Cresco Labs and some of the other providers in Illinois have paved the way for this industry to open up opportunities that really didn't exist for us, regardless of ethnic makeup. We've paved the way for a lot of people to now have an easier path forward to success in this industry because you're, you're absolutely right. The capital is a key to success in this cannabis space.

It's a capital intensive business with little resources from the federal government or the states that exist at this point. We're working on that legislation as well to hopefully improve over time. You saw the safe banking reform act that passed the house of representatives that now has to go before the Senate.

Things like that on a federal level will initiate, initiate more change than any other things that could possibly happen because then community banks wouldn't fear the FDIC coming in and shutting them down for lending money to cannabis applicants or moreover, minority cannabis applicants.

[Speaker 10] (33:30 - 33:36)
Okay. Let me ask you this. Are you looking to partner with any of the applicants that you all are helping?

[Speaker 2] (33:36 - 33:38)
So we're not able to partner.

[Speaker 10] (33:38 - 33:41)
We're not able to have, are you offering any capital support?

[Speaker 2] (33:41 - 34:30)
Oh yes, absolutely. A hundred percent. At the present time, all of the capital that we put into this comes with zero ownership and zero requirement to repayment.

So as that turns from, you know, a 10, 20, 50, a hundred thousand dollars situation to somebody building a $20 million building economics change, just like I had to take loans or I had to go out and, and give up equity to do some of those things that would be fair and reasonable. But to the extent that we're working now of, of the, the million and a half dollars we've put into the seed initiative for people to learn this program, to understand and, and work through the application process to get their first seed money to submit for the applications, all of that comes with no, no expectation of ownership, no expectation of repayment, no expectation of equity for Cresco Labs into any of those.

[Speaker 10] (34:30 - 34:33)
Would you be a potential supplier to the people that you help?

[Speaker 2] (34:33 - 34:34)
Of course, of course.

[Speaker 10] (34:35 - 34:36)
That's where you get your money from.

[Speaker 2] (34:36 - 34:50)
Well, yeah, we would, you know, the, the, if, if the applications that are out now are the retail applications. So, you know, we look to hopefully provide again with no requirement, but we would be there as a provider to either offer co-branded products.

[Speaker 10] (34:50 - 35:54)
I get it. I get it. We'll help you get up and running and get your supplies from me later.

We get it. The problem that we're having here in this, in the city of Chicago is unlike any other program you know, we've looked at this thing nationally. And if you look at it nationally, there is very little, if any, African-American participation in this industry.

And, you know, so, you know, we have a real hard time even understanding that, you know, we understand that you guys, the industry, help craft the laws that each one of these states are passing. And so, you know, there's really no incentive for you all to go in and say, we want to open this up to everybody when you're a publicly traded company that you have to, at the end of the day, go back to your shareholders for justification on the things that you are doing. And so it doesn't make sense to help people that you're going to compete against because that's basically contradicting your business model.

Okay. But I understand that they'll get their supplies from you. I totally get that.

Respectfully too, sir.

[Speaker 2] (35:54 - 36:53)
The, my competition is not anyone in the cannabis industry. My competition is big pharma. My competition is big alcohol.

My competition is big tobacco. So I want everybody to get a license in this space. I wish the laws were more open.

I wish the barriers were down. I wish the war on drugs wasn't a disparate impact on different communities and they didn't have preclusionary, the initial laws had preclusionary offenses of if you were busted with cannabis and it was on your record, you couldn't get a job in this space. So I'm excited to see a lot of the laws and the law enforcement change their ways.

It's not myself who's put this, this, the reason that a lot of minorities are not involved in this space. It was the war on drugs. And we're here to help right a lot of those wrongs along the way.

I'm excited for inclusion in this space. I genuinely think that cannabis is a phenomenal medical opportunity. I think it's a phenomenal business opportunity.

I think it's a phenomenal opportunity to right a lot of the wrongs that have been done in this country.

[Speaker 10] (36:53 - 36:55)
You can never right those wrongs.

[Speaker 2] (36:55 - 37:27)
I absolutely agree. But there's always a step forward. So looking forward to the future is doing things correctly to improve.

And we're here to do that. But we have to have a stable footing to do things like that. You know, we are not some giant.

When we talk about being a publicly traded company, I'm not Budweiser. I'm a one year publicly traded company who has done blood, sweat and tears to get to where we are, given a lot of people jobs, given a lot of people opportunity. And we want to improve this industry from the ground up.

And we've been doing that every day that we've been involved in this industry.

[Speaker 10] (37:27 - 37:28)
What's the net worth of your company right now?

[Speaker 2] (37:30 - 37:33)
The market cap of the company is about one point two billion dollars.

[Speaker 10] (37:34 - 37:44)
One point two billion. OK. Overall, nationally, what's the capital of the industry?

Do you have a number on that? Not just your company, but all the. I don't.

[Speaker 2] (37:44 - 37:52)
I hear numbers ranging of the size of the potential for that or of that company, of the industry ranging from a 10 to 50 billion dollar industry.

[Speaker 10] (37:52 - 37:57)
But I don't know what's your projected revenue once this thing gets rolled out in the city of Chicago.

[Speaker 2] (37:57 - 38:00)
As a publicly traded company, we don't put out forward looking statements.

[Speaker 10] (38:00 - 38:03)
OK, so there's no way we'll know exactly how much money you guys are making.

[Speaker 2] (38:04 - 38:47)
No, I think that the city. Well, no, absolutely you can. We have trailing.

We post quarterly earnings. We post quarterly results. Our last quarter, we had a net net loss of about a million dollars.

So as we're reinvesting capital into so we didn't we're not we weren't we didn't take home money at the end of the day. We had about a three million dollar positive EBITDA. But when you look at the expenditure and expanding to to to get prepared for recreational, our net loss was around 10 million dollars last quarter.

So all of that information as a public company is available after we file quarterly statements. So you'll always be able to check on what we're doing, what we're donating. All of that stuff is fully transparent, unlike a private company that you can't see some of those things.

[Speaker 10] (38:47 - 38:48)
OK, all right.

[Speaker 2] (38:48 - 38:51)
We just can't put forward looking statements to impact shareholders.

[Speaker 10] (38:51 - 40:04)
Well, hopefully you have a clear understanding on the challenges that we have here in the city of Chicago that, you know, millions of people have been arrested and locked up and had opportunities taken away from them and their families because of the marijuana industry and the war on drugs. And now that it's being legalized, those same people that were hurt by this industry having a door slammed in their face as far as opportunities to be able to, you know, benefit from the same industry that has hurt certain communities for decades. And it's just it's a problem.

And we right now, I just don't see how the industry is going to, you know, moving forward, as you say, right the wrong because I just don't see it. If you look at the trend nationally, there's still lack of minority participation in this industry. And so we understand that probably ninety nine point nine nine percent of this industry is owned by white men.

And, you know, history as we see it, there's not going to be inclusion when you look at how that makeup is is done throughout this country. So, you know, I don't see it and I don't know if my colleagues see it, but, you know, it is what it is. Alderman Dow.

[Speaker 19] (40:07 - 40:27)
Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman. You touched on a lot of the questions that I had. So I want to follow up with just a few more.

You mentioned you have fifteen hundred employees. That's national. That's a national number.

The approximate number. Yes, ma'am. OK, so in this particular site at thirty five, twenty four North Clark, how many employees do you have now?

[Speaker 2] (40:29 - 40:33)
Thirty five, twelve, twenty, that's what we're looking to open that site.

[Speaker 19] (40:33 - 40:36)
You're operating currently. In the city of Chicago.

[Speaker 2] (40:36 - 40:44)
Yes. How many employees do you have at the other dispensary at Medmar? I think there is eleven dispensaries.

[Speaker 19] (40:45 - 40:56)
Eleven people. Eleven people. And are those individuals from impacted areas?

According to the state of Illinois legislation, are they hired from those areas?

[Speaker 2] (40:57 - 41:06)
No. So that medical dispensary has been functioning since since inception. The location isn't something that we track against of where somebody is hired from.

[Speaker 19] (41:08 - 41:13)
But are you hiring people from the impacted areas? Yes.

[Speaker 2] (41:13 - 41:19)
And then that's I'm sorry. I thought you meant the existing staff as we shift and as this moves to a larger location and there's.

[Speaker 19] (41:20 - 41:31)
Your current employees, your current locations, are you hiring people from the impacted areas according to the state legislation? Yes, I'm sorry.

[Speaker 2] (41:31 - 41:33)
Absolutely. Yes, we are.

[Speaker 19] (41:33 - 41:40)
Do you know how many of these eleven employees are from those locations and what their diverse what their demographics are?

[Speaker 2] (41:41 - 42:17)
Sorry. And it's the current employees that have been with us for the last five years were not are not hired from those areas. There was not a that wasn't something that we checked as we move to increasing the staff to prepare for recreational.

So it goes from an eleven person staff to a 50 person staff. The goal is to hire 50 percent of the people from impacted areas on a go forward basis. So that's what on a go forward as we expand into these larger sites, as we get up zoning to allow more jobs and more opportunities.

The plan is to hire 50 percent of the employees from socially impacted areas.

[Speaker 19] (42:17 - 42:31)
All right. The second question I have is you mentioned you took a loss in the fourth quarter of twenty. The.

Third quarter, do you have your your profit statement for twenty eighteen?

[Speaker 2] (42:32 - 42:37)
Yes, all of our all of our financial information is available on Cresco Labs dot com.

[Speaker 19] (42:38 - 42:42)
So I'm trying what is the total profit for twenty eighteen for your company?

[Speaker 2] (42:43 - 42:44)
There was not a profit.

[Speaker 19] (42:45 - 42:45)
There was not a profit.

[Speaker 2] (42:46 - 42:48)
No, no. There was a there was an operating loss.

[Speaker 19] (42:48 - 42:58)
So the one point five million that you're investing in your social equity program is what percentage of your net worth?

[Speaker 2] (43:01 - 43:47)
So net worth, you know, the number I mentioned earlier is our market cap, which is which is different than like a balance sheet or something of that nature. So at the end of the third quarter, Cresco Labs had approximately, I think, sixty million dollars in cash on the balance sheet. As of the third quarter, that capital is majority earmarked for capital expansion to support the Illinois recreational cannabis program.

So I don't know the percentage that we invested into seed relative to other other things. What I will say is the overwhelming majority of capital that Cresco put forward to social initiatives was to the seed initiative.

[Speaker 19] (43:48 - 43:51)
That amount, the ceiling or the floor for you?

[Speaker 2] (43:52 - 43:58)
You know, this is just the beginning, right? We look forward to doing more to improve this industry as a whole.

[Speaker 19] (43:58 - 44:01)
Have you set up out a financial goal for that program?

[Speaker 2] (44:01 - 44:11)
Has not been a financial goal, but we do have a board strategy session on December 16th where we're looking at a multitude of different strategy sessions on a go forward basis.

[Speaker 19] (44:12 - 44:14)
OK, can you tell me what the House of Brands is?

[Speaker 2] (44:15 - 45:05)
House of Brands is a is a our portfolio of products that we've built that include medical products such as Remedy, a brand that is non combustible. So people who have cancer and don't want to smoke something can take pills, patches, salves, sprays, lotions, tinctures, a medical inhaler to still get the benefits of cannabis without combustion. Mindy's Mindy's Edibles is Mindy Siegel, who's a James Beard award winning pastry chef from Chicago.

She has a restaurant called Hot Chocolate in Bucktown. That is our edible line. So, again, introducing products that are non combustible through edible form for ingestion.

We have the Cresco brands, which are our normalized and professionalized version of cannabis. We have the Reserve brand, which is an elevated experience.

[Speaker 19] (45:06 - 45:16)
We have any of the one hundred and fifty people to be part of your House of Brands.

[Speaker 2] (45:17 - 45:50)
When we talk about the incubator program, it's designed specifically for them to get licenses on the go forward basis. But we do we do offer a multitude of apprenticeships. We offer a multitude of internships to get involved with our company.

And then, again, as I mentioned, the hiring of people to work in various aspects of our organization is a top priority for us. So so two part answer. The incubator program is specifically for helping people get licenses.

But I think your question is, do we allow people participate in the House of Brands in the building of brands? And the answer is absolutely yes.

[Speaker 19] (45:51 - 46:12)
Trying to get a sense of your commitment to social equity and and diversity across your company. And if you're seeking to work with minority companies, African-American companies that can be a part of your House of Brands as well, that can be part of your company.

[Speaker 2] (46:13 - 46:31)
We absolutely are constantly looking and evaluating opportunities to improve our company as a whole. We think that inclusion is the best way to do that. So, yes, we look at a multitude of different opportunities within the brand portfolio to address needs of of all of the ultimate consumers of cannabis on a go forward basis.

[Speaker 19] (46:33 - 46:34)
All right. Thank you, Mr. Chair.

[Speaker 10] (46:35 - 46:37)
Thank you. Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 8] (46:40 - 47:16)
Thank you, Chairman. Good morning, gentlemen. I don't want to harper on the points my colleagues already raised, but I do have some concerns.

I have concerns because I'm slightly confused by what I thought was one point five million dollars in philanthropy, but I think it's one point five million in your seed program. Is that correct? So when you said you were doing all those things in Englewood, all these expungements and that, is that part of your seed program or is that just regular community outreach?

[Speaker 7] (47:19 - 47:55)
The Barrington Rutherford, that's part of our our seed program. OK, the seed program has three pillars. So social equity and and social justice in which we support programs that are that restore rights.

So whether it's expungement in in Illinois, where expungement is possible, there are other states that don't have expungement. They have some other form of records clearing or sealing. And so and so we're clear this is one point five million across the 11 states that you operate in.

[Speaker 8] (47:55 - 47:58)
Or is this one point five million just in Chicago?

[Speaker 7] (47:58 - 48:22)
I think that the one point five million dollar number is a function of the specific items that Joe listed, the list that he read down. Our commitment to these programs is has been and will continue to be more and more each year. The spend is greater than one point five million in like sort of globally.

[Speaker 8] (48:22 - 48:56)
So because to Alderman Dowell's point about what's your commitment to social equity, if seed is the vehicle for your social equity to a one point two billion dollar market cap, that's barely one point two percent of your overall of your overall funding. That's the percentage she was asking for. So your commitment to social equity is barely one point two percent of your available revenue.

Is that or you're you're you're you're available your total worth, correct?

[Speaker 2] (48:57 - 49:09)
So neither of those. No, no. The market cap of the company is very different than the the assets that the company holds.

So as a as a public company, there's different dynamics that that we're interchanging here.

[Speaker 8] (49:09 - 49:11)
So then which which would be the proper.

[Speaker 2] (49:11 - 51:08)
So if you're looking at revenue, so to get right down to it, revenue of the company last year was approximately 60 million dollars. So you factor in 280 E, which is an oppressive tax regime that applies to cannabis where effective tax rates are greater than anyone can can even begin to to rationalize the effective tax rates on cannabis companies are upwards of 75 percent because you can't write off cost of goods sold. So without getting too into that, if you sell something for two dollars, you paid a dollar.

The only thing you can write off is a dollar, whereas every other business that everyone else operates gets to write off employees, insurance, rent, all of those other things. So at the cannabis level, you pay taxes on that gross profit, which is a dollar rather than what every other business in the world pays, which is on the 10 cents that you make on profit. So we are disproportionately taxed as an industry as a whole, a big problem with cannabis.

So the net income is greatly reduced. So if we did 60 million in revenue at an effective, we pay taxes on that money, right? Less our cost of goods sold.

So the net we had a net loss last year, but yet we still spent one point five million. So really what you're what you really want to compare is the zero profit or zero distributions that myself and the other ten thousand shareholders of Cresco Labs got all the while we contributed one point five million. So while people took salaries and we paid people's salaries, there are zero distributions.

Last year, there will be zero distributions this year. There will be zero distributions next year in cannabis at all for us. All the while, we will continue to reinvest into infrastructure.

We will reinvest into people. We will reinvest into the seed program. So things like market cap and net worth are not the correct measurement.

It's how much money does a company distribute? The answer is zero. And how much did we reinvest in social equity and other initiatives as well in excess of one point five million?

[Speaker 8] (51:11 - 51:19)
And so far, it would appear that sales are good. One hundred eighty four percent increase third quarter. What was your second quarter's increase?

[Speaker 2] (51:21 - 51:33)
I apologize, I don't have that off the top of my head, but I would assume similar. So and that's that's year over year that one. Yes, from I would assume the quarter 18, the third quarter is correct.

And I would assume it was similar the previous quarter.

[Speaker 8] (51:33 - 51:40)
So we're projecting then not to be making a loss when we're almost two hundred percent increase quarter to quarter. Correct.

[Speaker 2] (51:41 - 51:46)
We hope as a as a public company, the goal is to become profitable someday. Yes, absolutely.

[Speaker 8] (51:48 - 51:53)
It's hard to believe with three hundred million shares out there that you're not a profitable company.

[Speaker 2] (51:54 - 51:58)
I mean, again, the public records are available to look at all of those.

[Speaker 8] (51:58 - 52:03)
It's just mind boggling that three hundred people would invest in a non-profitable company.

[Speaker 2] (52:03 - 52:05)
It's a growth for sure.

[Speaker 8] (52:06 - 53:45)
Back to the seed initiative, because I think that's where a lot of my concern lies, which is, you know, I understand coming with a medical marijuana license, you have an opportunity in first crack to go into the adult use. What concerns me is how many people who are making that transition and are now trying to manipulate neighborhoods to try and corner the social equity market as well. When it comes to that aspect, how involved is your company in trying to identify social equity partners and what tactics are being used to do that?

Because I'm concerned as I see and hear more of your presence growing in communities like mine that I represent communities like Englewood, when we have individuals driving around trying to sign people up for LLCs, offering them twenty five thousand dollars signing bonuses if they've ever been convicted of marijuana crimes or if they're veterans, you know, I get nervous and I get nervous because what I'm hearing is that, you know, we're going to do everything we can to set you up.

Only to that, you have to pimp you out later here, and that makes me nervous because you're you're you're dangling things in front of communities like mine and communities like many of us here who aren't prepared, don't have the financial literacy or education to know how to counter anything you throw at them and are going to jump at the chance to make money. So what can you tell me to allay my fears that a company like yours isn't doing that to communities like ours?

[Speaker 2] (53:45 - 54:25)
Now I'll answer the first part and let Barrington turn it over. I'll make a statement that all of those things you're talking about are not us. So what I would ask is that you would involve your local law enforcement because those Ponzi schemes, those type of things are criminal by nature.

So I would encourage getting the enforcement arm of the great state of Illinois and in the city of Chicago to investigate those. If you find flyers, if you find those things, because that's not us. We are truly looking to help people.

We have no equity in it. We have no goal of repayment. Our goal is to help people get licenses in this to alleviate the concerns that this committee has going forward.

[Speaker 8] (54:25 - 54:49)
How is that any different than what I just described? You are just helping someone get a license and John Q somebody pulled up to me on the street and said, hey, I want to help you get a license. Here's the form to sign and I'll even help you with $25,000 and I don't need anything from you later.

I just need you to remember me when you get your license. How is that different from what you described to me right now?

[Speaker 2] (54:51 - 54:54)
It's very different. Because you are helping people get a license.

[Speaker 8] (54:55 - 54:55)
You are helping people.

[Speaker 2] (54:55 - 55:22)
I'm not out soliciting people to get a license. I'm offering a service. So I'm saying if you want to learn how to get a cannabis license, you come to us.

We will provide you free legal. We will provide you guidance. We will provide you resources.

We will let you know what we've done, the mistakes we've made, how we've improved our company, how this industry operates. Here's banks that we work with. Here's potential, whatever.

If they don't want to buy from me, I'm okay with that. I'm not looking.

[Speaker 8] (55:23 - 55:33)
That's not my objective here in any capacity. The assumption that someone who has no experience in this universe is not going to turn to the person who helped them get their license is foolish.

[Speaker 2] (55:34 - 55:40)
In my opinion. So should I not help them? What am I supposed to do?

[Speaker 8] (55:40 - 56:09)
To me it's foolish that you're making that argument. I'd rather you say that you're helping people get set up and more than likely they're going to come to the person that helped them. That I would appreciate, to be honest.

But what I think is foolish is that to say that you're not soliciting when you're offering the world to people to do this, that is a form of solicitation. And for anybody who's been disadvantaged or has no experience in this area, to think that they're not going to go back to the person who helped them, I don't buy that.

[Speaker 2] (56:09 - 56:11)
With all due respect, Alderman, I don't know.

[Speaker 8] (56:11 - 56:24)
I don't want to belabor this point because I know my colleagues have other, but I have serious concerns about the nature of how this is proceeding in communities that are impacted like mine. Thank you, Chairman. Alderman Reilly.

[Speaker 5] (56:27 - 56:42)
Thank you, Chairman. Didn't know that the Zoning Committee was going to devolve into an economics lesson, but here we are. Just for the record, didn't you just recently have a shareholder meeting on November 26th for an earnings call?

[Speaker 2] (56:42 - 56:43)
Yes, yes, we had an earnings call.

[Speaker 5] (56:43 - 56:50)
And what was reported in that earnings call to your shareholders, your performance on profitability that quarter?

[Speaker 2] (56:51 - 56:58)
I think, again, I don't have those numbers in front of me, but I think there was an EBITDA of about $3 million, give or take.

[Speaker 5] (57:00 - 57:04)
And again, to your profitability, because that's, I think, a key distinction.

[Speaker 2] (57:04 - 57:12)
Yeah, the profitability, we didn't have a net profit after you factor in the expenditures, the cash outlay of the company.

[Speaker 5] (57:12 - 57:41)
And I think you're cut off on the last line of questioning, but I think there was kind of this incredulous question, how on earth could all these people invest all this money and be posting losses? And I think who was kind of caught in the fray there was you said this is a growth industry, which means people are willing to make investments and extend themselves on the front end and take on a substantial amount of risk because they believe the industry has a future. Is that fair to say?

[Speaker 2] (57:41 - 57:46)
Yes, absolutely. That's where we're at in the beginning. We're in the first inning of this game, if you look at it.

[Speaker 5] (57:47 - 58:44)
And although you're in a very unique space because it isn't federally recognized and you have all sorts of tax impairments and financial impairments when it comes to lenders and financial institutions, I think it's important for people to understand that this is a nascent industry and that there's a long way to go before people are raking in all this cash that everyone's been talking about. I do see tremendous upside and a lot of opportunity. But having said that, one of the questions I thought was quite legitimate when it comes to equity, and that's a priority for this administration and for my colleagues and members of this committee, do you see a possibility of working with minority-owned equity craft grow license holders to sell their products in your retail stores?

[Speaker 2] (58:45 - 58:46)
Absolutely. We look forward to it.

[Speaker 5] (58:47 - 1:00:28)
And to be clear, if this industry is functioning properly a couple of years down the road from now, there should be some healthy competition in that space. Would that be fair to say? Yes.

And so I'm still confused by why my good friend and colleague was giving a hard time for providing resources to those folks who want to enter this industry and learn how to be successful business people in it as somehow setting yourselves up to have a corner on the wholesale market with these equity owners down the road, or the ability to buy them out or somehow bring them to Cal and fold it into your mega company. That's not your purpose here.

You understand that one of the weaknesses that the industry faces from an optics and practical reality standpoint is that many of the early entrants into the medical industry here are white guys, rich white guys. And my colleagues here who take issue with that, and I count myself among them, are right to ask these questions. Because when you have incumbents in any industry, greed and market forces dictate you'll have an interest in eventually snuffing out your competitors.

But I'd like to give you an opportunity to talk a little bit more about this investment you're making and providing the training and the know-how that folks who haven't done this professionally need to compete in the market for these equity craft grow licenses and retail operations.

[Speaker 2] (1:00:28 - 1:02:53)
Thank you, Alderman. When Cresco Labs started, it was a federally illegal activity that we participated in. To the extent that the FBI or whatever the whim of the federal legislation could come in and arrest us, they could prosecute us, we could serve time in prison, the war on drugs is by no means over.

And we are involved in improving this industry. The only way this industry improves is if there becomes a critical mass both on states approving cannabis, on federal change, on city change, on local change, across the board the decriminalization of cannabis, the rescheduling of cannabis, and a multitude of things that gives opportunities to people. We've made a lot of mistakes on how we've operated our business when it comes to the banging our head against the wall.

So as we look at all the mistakes we've made, and we've spent millions and millions and millions of dollars on those mistakes, allowing people to sit inside our brain and make sure they don't make those same mistakes is something we're excited to share with people. We don't want them to make those same mistakes that we made so they can get off the ground to a faster start than it did, because as I sit in front of you, we started back in 2013. My hope is that these companies that come out of Chicago on a go-forward basis are the national powerhouses.

We joke all the time in the cannabis industry, and I referenced it before, we don't have competition, we have cooperation. We try to build up every other person, because if somebody has a misstep along the way, if somebody feels pressure and they're not selling product out the front door and working within the compliance and regulatory framework, then all of a sudden it shines a light and law enforcement or whomever can say, I told you this was a bad idea, and comes in and shuts down the whole industry. So we want every single person that wants to be in this industry, that meets the requirements, that we can help meet those requirements, become a viable, not only applicant, but operator in this space.

It makes all of us better. It makes this industry better. It will make the city of Chicago better.

And I think we're doing the right things. I welcome the committee's advice on other things we can do, but we stand behind our seed program as a phenomenal way to give people opportunity and access to this well-needed and much-deserved industry as it grows on a grow-forward basis.

[Speaker 5] (1:02:53 - 1:03:02)
So obviously there's altruism here, but it's also, there's a self-interest, because mistakes made by other players in this industry will negatively impact your business, correct?

[Speaker 30] (1:03:02 - 1:03:03)
Absolutely.

[Speaker 5] (1:03:04 - 1:03:25)
Thank you for stating that. I also wanted to get to this other issue, because I've read about it mostly in social media, but my colleague Alderman Lopez brought up the issue of these roving recruiters driving through neighborhoods and handing out flyers and offering people $25,000, I guess. I want to know, for the record, that is not an activity that your company participates in?

[Speaker 2] (1:03:26 - 1:03:26)
That's correct.

[Speaker 5] (1:03:30 - 1:04:04)
And as far as, well, I'll leave it there. I guess I disagree with some of my colleagues who believe that you have these ulterior motives with your training program. When I met with representatives of your company, I was impressed that that was one of the things that you led with, and was not something that had to be deeply probed.

You offered that forward as, hey, this is how serious we take this industry, and we want everyone to be successful in it. So anyway, thank you for answering our questions. I appreciate the time, Chairman.

[Speaker 10] (1:04:04 - 1:04:09)
Thank you. If there are no other questions, I just wanted to recap.

[Speaker 4] (1:04:10 - 1:04:10)
Alderman.

[Speaker 10] (1:04:12 - 1:04:14)
I'm sorry. Alderman Spazzato.

[Speaker 24] (1:04:15 - 1:04:49)
Thank you, Chairman. I just wanted to make one comment. I came in a little late, but somebody mentioned, just because a business has a bunch of stocks doesn't mean they're profitable.

And just take a look at Uber and Lyft. I mean, everybody said Uber and Lyft, oh, that's going to be, everybody's going to get rich off it. That stuff's in the toilet right now.

So that's just one point I wanted to make, just because a company has a bunch of stocks or a bunch of shareholders, that does not mean they're profitable. And I'm not saying you guys are unprofitable, but Uber and Lyft is a good example when somebody says, oh, you have a bunch of shares of stocks. Does not make it profitable.

So thank you very much, Chairman.

[Speaker 25] (1:04:50 - 1:05:31)
Alderman Oichman. Facebook has a lot of stock, too, and I think they're kind of profitable. So I think that where this market is going in Chicago and across the country and trying to make sure that those in our city who need support, African-American, Hispanic residents of our city that are part of this process, I think has to be a goal that we all work on and not assume that it's going to work out.

Because I think the past has shown that it won't work out. So I think that that's something that we as a city have to continue to work on.

[Speaker 10] (1:05:36 - 1:05:37)
Alderman.

[Speaker 23] (1:05:38 - 1:06:16)
My point is, and I really appreciate this incredible discussion, and I certainly and still remain saddened about what the African-American community has gone through, especially with the war on drugs. I firmly, firmly believe in the need for reparations, and I would hope someday we can get to a point where we can access the sale of cannabis and involve that in the use of reparations. This injustice will continue until we address it head on, and we have not done so yet.

Thank you.

[Speaker 4] (1:06:17 - 1:06:51)
Alderman Burnett. Thank you. So you were saying that you're a corporation and you can't partner with anyone.

We certainly can partner with people. So you can't partner with people. So what if this body voted you down because you don't have a partner?

What if the majority, which is minorities in the body right now, voted no and you didn't get this? Then what would you do? Would you go back and get a partner?

[Speaker 2] (1:06:53 - 1:06:57)
No, I wouldn't. As a publicly traded company, we have a board.

[Speaker 4] (1:06:57 - 1:07:00)
But do you know the council is majority, minority?

[Speaker 2] (1:07:00 - 1:07:04)
Yes. I'm aware of the City of Chicago board's makeup.

[Speaker 4] (1:07:06 - 1:07:16)
So what if everybody voted against you just to send a message to everybody that you have to have minority partners? What if that happened? What would you do?

[Speaker 2] (1:07:20 - 1:07:25)
I'm a big boy. I would take whatever the committee feels is the right action.

[Speaker 4] (1:07:25 - 1:07:38)
So what would you do? Would you go find a partner? Would you readjust?

I mean, you got this money invested. You bought the property. I guess you bought a company.

Would you go and make it work? Would you make it work?

[Speaker 2] (1:07:39 - 1:07:41)
I have an operating business.

[Speaker 4] (1:07:41 - 1:07:43)
Would you figure out a way to make it work?

[Speaker 2] (1:07:44 - 1:08:36)
The operating business is currently intact and operating. We are trying to hire more people. We are trying to increase the tax base.

So if the council doesn't think that expanding the size and meeting the future requirements is a benefit to the overall City of Chicago and that the initiatives we're putting in place are not towards the overall benefit of the City of Chicago, I respect the committee's opinions. I respect the committee's decisions. We will continue on and operate in what's in the best interest of our overall shareholders.

I work at the privilege of our board of directors and our shareholders. Whatever the outcome is in every part of our day, I deal with, I address. I had cancer in my life.

I survived that. I'll overcome any obstacle that the world puts in front of me. I will make sure that our company survives and our shareholders are in the best place possible.

[Speaker 4] (1:08:36 - 1:08:44)
So you'll figure out a way to make it work? I've worked my whole life on making things work. Or will you not do business in the state?

Will you leave the state?

[Speaker 2] (1:08:44 - 1:09:01)
Sir, we have, we have, I have hundreds of employees that count on me in this state of Illinois to provide them with opportunity, their job, their health care, their health insurance, things like that. So I have an obligation to them.

[Speaker 4] (1:09:01 - 1:09:13)
What if every African American, every Hispanic alderman, every female alderman stood up and said that we're not going to stand for all white males just to run this industry and didn't vote for you?

[Speaker 2] (1:09:15 - 1:09:25)
I, I think those are, those are two different topics. You have a social equity initiative that's taking place to give a multitude of licenses to the best social act.

[Speaker 4] (1:09:25 - 1:09:39)
So right now, right now you're spending money. Right now you're spending your money on preparing other people to do something somewhere else at some other time instead of spending money or allowing them to be a partner with you.

[Speaker 2] (1:09:39 - 1:09:58)
With all due respect, you're talking about some other time. That's January, that's February, that's May. In my time that is very close.

You will have a multitude of new applicants. You will have a multitude of people who are excited to be in this space and I hope that the council doesn't take things away from those people and take the opportunities away from those people.

[Speaker 4] (1:09:58 - 1:10:29)
So the way some of us, the way some of us feel about this situation, so you know I have a west side ward, you know I got brothers right now shooting each other over selling weed on the corner. You know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying?

They're dying every day. Right? I got people coming to my office because they're fighting over weed.

Right? And they want them off their block and they're in prison in their homes because of weed. I got a weed spot, I got a weed spot on Grand and Monticello.

Right? And legalizing cannabis helps that. It helps.

[Speaker 2] (1:10:29 - 1:10:31)
Fights the war on drugs. Legalizing cannabis.

[Speaker 4] (1:10:31 - 1:11:48)
Decriminalizing cannabis. So if more African Americans was in the business, they could hire some of those African Americans that's on the street. Right?

I mean we know that we hire ours more than anybody else. You understand what I'm saying? Then it'll give them another view of it.

Or they're just going to go back and do the things that they do. You know, I mean, we appreciate the fact, so the way some of us look at this, if you don't open your business up, we don't lose anything. You know, I mean it's not a loss because we're losing lives every day in reference to this stuff.

You know, people are going to jail every day in reference to these things. You know, so for some of us, this is life or death. You know, it's not just about your money.

It's a bigger picture for some of us in this community, man. You know, and you say you're doing all these things, but you've been around for a while. What you been doing all this other time?

What have you been doing to help minorities or social equity people all this other time you've been in business? You know, I mean, it's just ingenuous. It's disingenuous, man, what you all are saying here.

I understand you want to make your money, man. Just give up some. Give the brothers a piece.

That's all. Just give the brothers a piece. Now, what if we all voted against you?

[Speaker 10] (1:11:49 - 1:11:51)
All right, you're beating a dead horse there, Alderman.

[Speaker 4] (1:11:51 - 1:11:51)
Jesus.

[Speaker 1] (1:11:53 - 1:14:02)
Alderman Tunney? Thank you, Chairman and my colleagues. Obviously, this committee has talked about cannabis legislation for the last number of years and the last year for that matter, and some of the corrections are going to require some state participation in regards to ownership and diversity and such.

This process has met with the support of the community. Med-Mar has been located on Clark Street three blocks north of this location without incident. This is a brave new world with the recreational component of it, but it did meet with the support of both surrounding neighborhood groups, and I would hope as the team has put together that just like any business, you got to grow equity from the bottom up, and you've got to make sure that these stores and people that develop equity are going to be successful.

And I think part of this incubator program and the ability to recruit short term, I mean literally in the first six months of next year, I would like to see this application be passed, and they also have to go back to ZBA because it is a different location. It's three blocks south. But I would like to ask your favorable consideration on this.

It does meet with the community support, and I actually think that this equity piece and the expungement part of it is really, as the applicant has said, we're in the first inning. And I know that they are taking this to heart, and I believe if we don't do something with this legislation, we won't move forward as a city. And a part of that is going to require, I believe, according to the mayor, some state legislation too.

So I'd ask if you would consider supporting this in a positive vote. Thanks. All right.

[Speaker 10] (1:14:02 - 1:15:33)
If there are no other questions, I just wanted to state one more thing. I want to actually differ from my colleague of the 42nd Ward. I didn't hear anybody state that you guys were participating in any outreach, you know, solicitation of people.

But in general, he's saying that my colleague, Alderman Lopez, was saying that there are people out there doing that. And I just want to specifically state that he did not accuse you all of participating in that type of activity. But at the same time, we in the African-American community have seen this movie over and over and over again.

Social equity is nothing but the MBE, WBE program here in the city of Chicago, where we set a bar, but yet minority participation is very low in this city of Chicago. And so we're looking at this as being no different from that. The program is there, and there's a floor, and we have a hard time even getting to the floor as far as minority participation when it comes to contracts, whether it be supplying or construction.

And so that's why we're very concerned about that. And so hopefully you guys will take to heart what this body is saying and really do something from your heart and do something that's positive to right the wrong that has hurt our community for decades to come. Is there a motion?

Roll call, please. Roll call.

I don't know what I'm going to do. I've got to get Sposato up. Jack, we're going to have to wait for Sposato now.

[Speaker 38] (1:16:50 - 1:16:54)
I love you. All right.

[Speaker 1] (1:16:55 - 1:17:02)
Nick. Nick. Do you want to?

Yeah. What page? Do you have one item?

[Speaker 21] (1:17:05 - 1:17:05)
Let's move to it.

[Speaker 1] (1:17:09 - 1:17:35)
All right. At the request of Alderman Sposato, we're going to move to page 17. Top of page 17, document number 20158, 38th Ward.

Order is referred on September 18th of this year. Common address, 5535 through 55 West Irving Park Road. Change request, B31 Community Shopping District to a C21 Motor Vehicle Related Commercial District.

Councilor.

[Speaker 15] (1:17:36 - 1:18:32)
Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, my name is Mark Kupiak. I'm an attorney with offices at 77 West Washington. I represent the applicant.

And with me today on behalf of the applicant, Anthony Marino, who's seated beside me. And subject property actually currently used for storage of automobiles. It's been used in that fashion for years.

Down the street on Irving Park Road, a number of car dealerships over the years. We need a zoning change. There's two reasons.

To be able to allow the outdoor sales of automobiles. And to be able to continue the outdoor storage of automobiles. The applicant has met with, spoke with Alderman Sposato and also his neighbors.

And I believe Alderman Sposato is here to speak for himself on his position.

[Speaker 24] (1:18:34 - 1:19:14)
Alderman. Thank you, Chairman. I'm here to support Anthony Marino from Jeep Marino in the zoning change there.

This has basically been a car parking lot for at least 10 years that I know of. A while ago we zoned it, tried to develop it. Unfortunately, we have a bad owner there right now that's made things difficult.

And the Marino family are good business owners in the community. And I think they'll do the right thing and fix it up a little. And hopefully down the road we'll be back and he'll be selling it.

And we'll have a nice back to the Starbuck issue. But I ask your favorable consideration in this matter.

[Speaker 1] (1:19:14 - 1:20:46)
Thank you, Alderman. Questions by committee members? If not, can I get a motion?

Motion by Alderman Lopez. Moves do pass. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it.

Item is passed. Thank you. Thank you.

All right. Okay. Now we're moving again in the bottom of page 18.

[Speaker 38] (1:20:47 - 1:20:47)

[Speaker 1] (1:20:57 - 1:21:15)
Okay. Let me repeat the last one. 3001 through 3029 North Sheffield.

Thank you. Thank you. With that, I'm going to ask Chairman Austin, would you come and conduct this?

Again, it's in the 44th Ward.

[Speaker 4] (1:21:16 - 1:21:17)
Everything is in the 44th Ward.

[Speaker 38] (1:21:18 - 1:21:20)
This is for Mr. George today.

[Speaker 21] (1:21:23 - 1:21:25)
Brilliant in everything except for cannabis.

[Speaker 11] (1:21:26 - 1:21:29)
Good morning, Madam Chair and members of the committee.

[Speaker 21] (1:21:29 - 1:21:31)
Please state your name and title for the record.

[Speaker 11] (1:21:32 - 1:22:37)
My name is John George. I'm an attorney with offices at 71 South Wacker. I'm here this morning on behalf of the applicant, which is Advocate Northside Health Center, D.B. Advocate Health, Illinois Masonic Medical Center. Seated to my right is Susan Nordstrom-Lopez, the president of the hospital. And next to her is Mr. Tim Tracy, the architect on the project. And the last man there is Mr. Michael Werthman from KLOA, the traffic engineering firm that we hired in this matter. As Alderman Tunney indicated, this is plan development number 50. When he gave the boundaries of it, what we're seeking, we're also adding some additional property, which is property that was owned by the CTA, which is going to be subarea E of this property. This application, Madam Chairman and members of the committee, was before the Chicago Plan Commission on November the 21st.

At that time, it was unanimously supported, and I would ask that the report of proceedings before the Chicago Plan Commission be incorporated into and be made a part of the proceedings before this committee this morning.

[Speaker 21] (1:22:38 - 1:22:48)
If there be no objections, we accept the plan commission. So moved by Alderman Lopez. All in favor signify by saying aye.

Aye. Still be moved.

[Speaker 11] (1:22:48 - 1:24:30)
What we're seeking to do today is to get the approval of an amendment to plan development number 50. What we're doing is proposing to add property to the boundaries of the plan development in order to construct a new parking garage for the faculty and staff, which will be what we call subarea D. The proposed garage will step up approximately 50 feet in height from the western boundary to 74 feet on the east next to the L tracks.

It will contain 408 parking spaces with ground floor clinic space proposed to house the physical therapy program for the hospital. We've had extensive traffic studies done. We've met on numerous occasions with the organizations and the community organizations.

We've met a number of times with Alderman Tunney on this project. There's been a lot of changes to this project from the time we first started on it, and what I think you see today and what's reflected in the report is a project that we're very, very proud of. We have entered into an agreement with one of the community organizations, CLVN, which is the Central Lakeview Neighbors.

We've entered into this agreement with them to provide parking spaces for them in our garage and some other additional parking arrangements for them. They have indicated their support for it. Madam Chairman, I know of no objections to this proposed application.

I believe it satisfies all the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Chicago and the Plan Development Ordinance, and I would ask favorably for the support of all of you this morning for this project, and I stand ready to answer any questions as do Susan Lopez and my other witnesses.

[Speaker 21] (1:24:31 - 1:24:47)
Thank you, Mr. George. Any questions by the committee? If there are no questions by the committee, is there a motion?

No. They've said it all for you.

[Speaker 1] (1:24:49 - 1:25:22)
Actually, as Mr. George has said, there was a lot of discussion over the community, and I think the highlight of this is actually the ground floor is completely energized with physical therapy spaces. So it's a garage with ground floor retail. It is a busy intersection of Sheffield and Wellington, and obviously much needed for the hospital's master plan, which this council has approved over the years and will continue to work with Susan Lopez and the team here.

So we're happy to support it, and I ask for your favorable consideration.

[Speaker 21] (1:25:22 - 1:25:51)
Thanks. Well, thank you, Alderman Tunney, but as I said, Mr. George has said it all for you. Your rendering always speaks for the work that you have done.

I believe that Mr. George did state that he had met with the alderman of the said property several times, so we know that whatever this project would be would be outstanding for that community, and if there's no objections, I move to pass as revised. All in favor signify by saying aye.

[Speaker 38] (1:25:51 - 1:25:52)
Aye.

[Speaker 21] (1:25:54 - 1:25:56)
The ayes have it. Okay, thank you.

[Speaker 11] (1:25:56 - 1:25:58)
Thank you, Madam Chairman and members of the committee.

[Speaker 21] (1:25:58 - 1:26:06)
Are we done? I said as revised. Nope.

You're welcome.

[Speaker 1] (1:26:09 - 1:26:14)
Now we're going to the regular order. We've got one more. Alderman Michelle Smith.

[Speaker 38] (1:26:18 - 1:26:21)
Is she here? She's here. Okay.

[Speaker 26] (1:26:21 - 1:26:22)
All right. All right.

[Speaker 1] (1:26:24 - 1:26:56)
Where's my mic? Okay. All right.

So, on the regular agenda, page two, document number 20262T1 in the second ward, ordinance referred on November 13th of 19, common address 2105 through 09, West Caton. Change request, B23, neighborhood mixed-use district to a B33, community shopping district.

[Speaker 14] (1:26:57 - 1:27:49)
Counselor? Thank you, Chairman. For the record, Nick Petikas from the Law Offices of Sam Banks.

I'm here on behalf of the Applicant Public 2 LLC, and here with me is Ms. Anita Korczak on behalf of the LLC. The subject property is a triangular-shaped lot that was actually rezoned about a year ago pursuant to a Type 1 application for a nine-unit residential building. A new ownership structure has come to the property and is proposing an eight-residential unit building with ground floor retail space.

So, because we're modifying the uses within the Type 1, we're required to amend our plan set. So, we are seeking, again, a zoning change to establish a B3-3, Type 1, pursuant to the plan filed with our application. We have met with Alderman Hopkins.

We previously provided a letter of support, but I also see that the Alderman is here and may wish to speak on the project.

[Speaker 18] (1:27:50 - 1:28:19)
Alderman Hopkins? Thank you, Chairman Toney. We have no objection to moving forward at this time.

The Neighborhood Association of Brecker, the Worker Park Committee, has informally looked at this and has requested the opportunity to meet with the applicant and submit some aesthetic changes to the design. We anticipate that meeting will occur sometime prior to the December 8th Council meeting, and barring any unforeseen development, we'll support moving forward on that.

[Speaker 1] (1:28:20 - 1:28:33)
Thank you, Alderman. Thank you, Alderman. Alderman, I'm a little familiar with the street.

Is that a historic landmark street? Out of the L-Tracks.

[Speaker 14] (1:28:33 - 1:28:37)
So, this is the last piece of property. It's a triangular-shaped lot.

[Speaker 1] (1:28:39 - 1:28:41)
It's cut at an angle by Milwaukee.

[Speaker 38] (1:28:41 - 1:28:42)
Yes. Okay, great.

[Speaker 1] (1:28:42 - 1:29:21)
All right, any questions from committee members? Hearing none, can I get a motion? So moved.

Alderman Cary-Austin moves. Do pass. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? Can you Chair of the Ayes have it?

Thank you very much. Thank you, sir. Bottom of page 2, document number 20264-T1 in the 4th Ward, ordinance referred on November 13th of this year.

Common address, 4601 through 4611 South Ellis Avenue. And the change request, RT-4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to a B-2-3 neighborhood mixed-use district.

[Speaker 3] (1:29:33 - 1:29:45)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Sarah Barnes and I'm an attorney with the Law Offices of Sam Banks. Mr. Chairman, I just…

[Speaker 38] (1:29:45 - 1:29:46)
Your question.

[Speaker 3] (1:29:47 - 1:30:16)
Oh, I'm sorry. My name is Sarah Barnes and I'm an attorney with the Law Offices of Sam Banks. I'm here this morning on behalf of item 4601 through 4611 South Ellis Avenue.

I did just have the opportunity to speak with the Alderman's office and unfortunately she got called away on a personal matter and was unable to attend the hearing today. She does want to testify in support of this project, but she wants to be here personally. So I ask that…

[Speaker 8] (1:30:16 - 1:30:17)
You're asking to hold.

[Speaker 3] (1:30:17 - 1:30:20)
…to defer it actually to the next committee.

[Speaker 8] (1:30:20 - 1:30:20)
We're deferring it.

[Speaker 3] (1:30:21 - 1:30:22)
We are going to defer it, yes.

[Speaker 38] (1:30:24 - 1:30:24)
Okay.

[Speaker 3] (1:30:25 - 1:30:33)
Defer it. Alderman King will not be able to make it here today, so she asked that we just defer it to the next committee hearing. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:30:34 - 1:30:41)
Alderman Lopez moves to defer. All those in favor? Aye.

Aye. Any opposed? Please make sure the ayes have it.

The item is deferred.

[Speaker 3] (1:30:41 - 1:30:41)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:30:42 - 1:31:09)
All righty. Top of page 3, document number 20255-T1 in the 11th Ward. Ordinance is referred on November 13th of this year.

Common address 2119 South Halsted. Change request M12, Limited Manufacturing Business Park District to a B33 Community Shopping District.

[Speaker 9] (1:31:10 - 1:32:23)
Good morning. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the board. My name is Paul Kolpak, with offices at 6767 North Milwaukee Avenue.

I represent the applicant, Grain Liquors, LLC. The request today is to change the zoning from the M12 Limited Manufacturing Business Park District to that of a B33 Community Shopping District. The property in question was a restaurant and with eight dwelling units.

It was a legal nonconforming use in that zoning district. Unfortunately, they let their liquor license lapse in order to reinstate it. We had to change the zoning from the M1-2 to that of B3-3.

We will then maintain and legalize the use of the property, continue the operation of the existing business restaurant with accessory liquor, and there are currently eight units. Nothing on the property will change. It's just a matter of putting it into compliance.

We had a community meeting at the 11th Ward. There was about eight people there, and they were all in favor of it because this restaurant bar is a part of the community. If you have any questions, I'm happy to answer them.

[Speaker 1] (1:32:23 - 1:32:45)
We have a letter of no objection from Alderman Thompson on file. We have the same letter. Questions?

Just a quick question for me. Obviously, this has just been a lap existing business. Correct.

For how long? Because it has to be gone for like six months or something like that?

[Speaker 9] (1:32:45 - 1:33:18)
It was over six months. Once they found out that their liquor license lapsed, they were told that they could just apply for a new license. We met with the Committee on Zoning, and they said, no, you have to change the zoning because it's a non-conforming use.

Then we had the meeting with the Alderman, and then we had a community meeting to accept that. Mr. Valenzuela knows about this. You're okay?

Surprise. All right.

[Speaker 30] (1:33:19 - 1:33:47)
Yes, Steve Valenzuela, Department of Planning and Development. The issue is that they couldn't renew their license. They're more than 4,000 square feet in an M district.

The remainder of the street has all been rezoned to be a business district. This would be in keeping with the rest of Halsted Street here and allow this business to go forward lawfully, and also to legitimize or legalize the number of units that are on the floors above. We support this.

[Speaker 38] (1:33:49 - 1:33:49)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (1:33:49 - 1:34:29)
Other questions? Committee members? Carrying on, can I get a motion?

I'll move. Carrie Austin moves to pass. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? Can you and the Chair of the Ayes have the item as passed?

All right. Carrying on to the middle of page 3, item number 20252, T1, 11th Ward, ordinance referred on November 13th of 19, common address 4241 South Halsted, change request RS1, residential single unit detached house to a B23, neighborhood mixed-use district.

[Speaker 9] (1:34:31 - 1:35:36)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the board. My name is Paul Kulpak with offices at 6767 North Milwaukee Avenue. I represent Casper Development, LLC 4223.

We're here today requesting zoning change from the RS1, residential single unit detached housing district to that of B2-3, neighborhood mixed-use district. The purpose is to construct a two-story masonry single-family residence with a two-car frame detached garage. My client bought nine lots.

Eight of the lots to the north are zoned B2-3. Alderman Thompson had years ago downzoned the corner lot from the B2-3 to an RS1 district. We had a meeting with you, Alderman.

We had a meeting with the community group. We've indicated that we would build as a single-family dwelling unit. And we have submitted plans under the T1 in order to do that.

We have a letter of support from the Alderman in the file. Questions from committee members?

[Speaker 1] (1:35:38 - 1:35:47)
I have a question for the department on this one. Single-family home for a B2-3, is that, that's a big home.

[Speaker 9] (1:35:49 - 1:36:20)
The lot is. Unless it's a very small lot. Well, the lot that's being rezoned, actually it's in continuation.

The other eight lots are all zoned B2-3. They're all the same size. The lot that was rezoned was 25 feet wide.

In order to break them up to get the nine units, that lot, if this rezoning passes, will then be reconfigured into a 23-foot wide lot. And, therefore, it's the side yards that are really critical to us.

[Speaker 1] (1:36:24 - 1:36:44)
All right. We've got a long agenda, so you're comfortable with whatever. Well, Alderman Thompson is comfortable.

All right. Any other questions? Can I get a motion?

Alderman Lopez moves to pass. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Continue to share the ayes have it. The item is passed.

[Speaker 9] (1:36:44 - 1:36:45)
Thank you very much for your consideration.

[Speaker 1] (1:36:45 - 1:37:10)
Bottom of page three. Document 20239, T1. In the 11th ward, ordinance referred on November 13th of this year.

Common address, 3084 South Lock Street. Change request, B3-1. Community shopping district to a B2-3.

Neighborhood mixed-use district. Mr. Moore.

[Speaker 6] (1:37:10 - 1:37:46)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name, for the record, is Thomas S. Moore, and with me today is Mr. William Elliott, who is the owner of this property that had both apartments but mostly was a commercial business. It used to have a light bulb shop. It had different things in it, but it's been vacant for some time. Mr. Elliott hopes to make it a four-unit all-residential property, and so we had a community meeting in the 11th ward, and we have a letter of support from Alderman Thompson. We request your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (1:37:49 - 1:37:52)
Do we have a substitute narrative?

[Speaker 6] (1:37:54 - 1:38:00)
I don't. I think it's the same as we filed it originally. I do have.

[Speaker 1] (1:38:05 - 1:38:06)
This is T1?

[Speaker 6] (1:38:06 - 1:38:08)
It is a T1, yes.

[Speaker 1] (1:38:08 - 1:38:09)
The department says there's a substitute narrative.

[Speaker 6] (1:38:11 - 1:38:13)
Okay. I'm sorry.

[Speaker 1] (1:38:14 - 1:38:15)
Do you want to make sure that you're talking about this?

[Speaker 6] (1:38:15 - 1:38:27)
No, we have filed very well. Excuse me. I'm sorry.

Thank you. Would you? We have filed.

[Speaker 1] (1:38:27 - 1:38:40)
We need to move the substitute narrative and plans for the T1 application. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Hearing none, the substitute narrative and plans are accepted. Now.

[Speaker 6] (1:38:40 - 1:38:58)
Thank you. Now, ditto on everything we just said before. We have community support and the aldermanic support, and this will take a building that is largely being unused and make it into a viable four-dwelling unit.

We'd request your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (1:39:00 - 1:39:02)
No change to the exterior of the building?

[Speaker 8] (1:39:02 - 1:39:03)
None at all.

[Speaker 1] (1:39:03 - 1:39:03)
Okay.

[Speaker 38] (1:39:03 - 1:39:03)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (1:39:05 - 1:39:19)
Can I get a motion? Alderman Kaplan moves to pass with the substitute narrative and plans. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? We need to carry the ayes as the substitute narrative was accepted.

[Speaker 6] (1:39:19 - 1:39:20)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (1:39:20 - 1:39:49)
All right. Next. Bottom of page four.

Document number 20253, 15th Ward. Ordinance referred on November 13th of this year. Common address.

4542 through 48, South Washtenaw. And the change request. RS3, residential single unit detached house district to an RT4, residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district.

[Speaker 9] (1:39:50 - 1:40:55)
Paul? Good afternoon. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the board. My name is Paul Kopack with offices at 6767 North Milwaukee. I represent the applicant Heidi Chow Eng. Our zoning request is change the zoning from the RS3, residential single unit detached housing district to RT4, residential two-flat townhome and multi-unit district.

The property is currently 75 feet by 125. On one 25-foot lot, there's a garage. On the other 25-foot lot, there's a four-unit building.

And then there's a vacant piece of property. We met with Alderman Lopez's zoning committee and requested the zoning change to allow us to divide the lot into a 50 and 25-foot wide lot. Therefore, the four-unit building would be in conformity.

And we would be able to sell the vacant single family, a vacant lot to build a single family home on that property. I believe we have support of the Alderman on this project.

[Speaker 20] (1:40:56 - 1:40:57)
Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 8] (1:40:58 - 1:41:30)
Thank you, Chairman, and please forgive me. You will have our official letter of support before the end of the day. My apologies.

But, yes, Mr. Kopack and the owner did meet with my committee, my community's public committee. They're in full support. Ironically, I don't know if I was able to tell you that day, but when the war was first remapped, this actually was a property I was looking at moving into.

But I'm glad that they're being able to put it to good use and fully support this and ask the committee to do the same. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:41:30 - 1:41:45)
Thank you, Alderman. Questions for committee members? Hearing none, Alderman Kaplan moves do pass.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

Can you share the ayes have it? And this item is passed.

[Speaker 9] (1:41:46 - 1:41:46)

Nick. Thank you, sir. Again, for the record, Nick Petikas from the Law Offices of Sam Banks.

I'm here on behalf of the applicant and property owner, GPS Investments Beverly LLC. The applicant is proposing a zoning change to permit a new car wash, automated car wash facility to replace an existing car wash facility. The current B1 zoning doesn't support the use.

It's a nonconforming use. And the C11 will allow the new automated car wash, again, to be constructed. We have met with Alderman O'Shea's Development Committee.

We have had provided a letter of support from the Alderman's office. We're not aware of any pending objection, and we'd be happy to answer any questions you might have.

[Speaker 1] (1:42:53 - 1:43:37)
All right. We do have a letter of support from Alderman O'Shea. Questions from committee members?

Hearing none. Alderman Osterman moves to pass on this item. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? The opinions of the ayes have it.

This item is passed. Thank you, sir. All right.

[Speaker 15] (1:43:41 - 1:43:42)
Mr. Chairman, members of the committee.

[Speaker 1] (1:43:44 - 1:43:46)
Okay. Great. Proceed.

[Speaker 15] (1:43:47 - 1:45:04)
Good. Thank you. My name is Mark Kupiec.

I'm an attorney with offices at 77 West Washington. I represent the applicant. And I have with me today on behalf of the applicant, Harris Pervez, who is seated beside me.

Subject property, two lots. Presently improved with one mixed-use building and one vacant lot. Recent history, the vacant lot was used for outdoor vehicle storage.

The proposal is a rezoning to allow us to build a four-story mixed-use building, round floor commercial and residential units on the upper floors. We're located, subject property located on Taylor Street, Arterial Street. A lot of commercial use on Taylor Street.

The mixed-use building will continue that commercial use on Taylor Street. The residential will be on the upper floors. At the alderman's request, we did follow his rezoning procedure, completed the survey, submitted the plans.

We then appeared before his advisory committee to explain the project and answer the questions. After our appearance before the committee, the applicant went and cleaned up the vacant lot, removed the vehicles that had been stored there for some time, and followed up with aldermanic staff to ask for the alderman's support. I do see the alderman is here today.

[Speaker 1] (1:45:06 - 1:45:11)
We do have the alderman here and his letter of support. Alderman, would you like to say a few words?

[Speaker 18] (1:45:13 - 1:45:27)
I just want to thank the applicant for being very diligent with us. I think they will comply with some of the recommendations made by our zoning advisory board. This is a great project.

I think it will be a great addition to the Little Italy community. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:45:27 - 1:46:14)
Thank you, alderman. Any questions for the alderman or committee members? Hearing none, can I get a motion by alderman Kappelman.

Moves do pass on this item. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Continue to chair the ayes have it. Item has passed.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, alderman.

All right. Top of page six. Document number 20263 in T1 in the 27th ward.

Ordinance is referred on November 13th of this year. Common address 862 through 68 North Orleans Street. Change request.

C12 neighborhood commercial district to a DX7 downtown mixed use district.

[Speaker 14] (1:46:15 - 1:46:37)
All right. Nick? Chairman, for the record, Nick from the law office of Sam Banks.

Chairman, the alderman and department of planning and I have had a conversation. We're going to voluntarily ask to defer the matter and potentially amend the application to allow the voting structure to get us to where we need to be in terms of floor area. So if we could just ask for a deferral at this point, that would be great.

[Speaker 1] (1:46:38 - 1:47:17)
So we have a motion to defer. Alderman Burnett moves to defer. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it.

Item is deferred. Thank you, sir. Middle of page six.

[Speaker 24] (1:47:17 - 1:47:18)
Good morning.

[Speaker 1] (1:47:18 - 1:47:21)
Do you identify yourself for the record? I don't have it on the sheet. Absolutely.

[Speaker 24] (1:47:21 - 1:48:04)
My name is Keith Hales. My wife and I are the owners of the property of 1455 West Huron. All right.

We are here today seeking the council's approval for RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RM5 residential multi-unit district. This is to comply with the current bulk requirement of the zoning code in order to convert from five to six units. We have a letter approving approval from the Eckerd Park Council as well as we have met with the alderman and also conducted a community meeting in which the alderman is also in favor of us.

[Speaker 4] (1:48:05 - 1:48:07)
Okay. Well, the alderman is here. So, Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 38] (1:48:07 - 1:48:08)
Yes.

[Speaker 4] (1:48:08 - 1:48:23)
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, as the gentleman said. He did meet with the local community organization and we had a community meeting. There were no objections.

So, I move to pass and I ask for the committee's support. Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (1:48:23 - 1:48:27)
Any questions for the attorney? Are you an attorney?

[Speaker 4] (1:48:27 - 1:48:29)
I am the owner.

[Speaker 18] (1:48:29 - 1:48:29)
I am not an attorney.

[Speaker 1] (1:48:29 - 1:48:40)
Okay. For the owner or the alderman? Hearing none.

Alderman Lopez moves to pass on the item. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Chair, the ayes have it. Item is passed.

Good luck to you, sir.

[Speaker 24] (1:48:40 - 1:48:41)

All right. Top of page 7, document number 20235, 30th Ward, ordinance referred on November 13th of this year. Common address, 2440 North Laurel Avenue.

I hope that's pronounced right. Change request, RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RT3.5 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district. Good afternoon, sir.

State your name, please.

[Speaker 35] (1:49:22 - 1:49:58)
Aditya Ramani. I'm the owner of the property. So, it's an existing three-story building and it was originally zoned as two-unit and we just want to set it up so that my wife and I, we can live on the top floor.

So, to legalize that, we met the Alderman, Mr. Arion Raboyos, in August and then we went through the process and filed the paperwork and I spoke to his secretary, Irma, and she said they had issued a letter sending to the, essentially, a letter of support.

[Speaker 1] (1:50:00 - 1:50:02)
We do have that on file from Alderman Raboyos.

[Speaker 35] (1:50:03 - 1:50:13)
Yeah. Yeah, and it would be great because then we can finally live there without being in violation of zoning rules and regulations.

[Speaker 38] (1:50:14 - 1:50:14)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:50:15 - 1:50:23)
So, currently, how many units are on the property? Two. Two.

And the request is upzoning to 3.5 to add that third unit.

[Speaker 35] (1:50:23 - 1:50:34)
Yeah, and there's no external change of structure. We're not building anything new. It's just we added an entry and exit to bring it to fire court and then just trying to legalize that, that we can.

[Speaker 1] (1:50:34 - 1:50:53)
Okay. Thank you very much for coming down. Any questions for the owner?

I know we do have a letter of support, again, from Alderman Raboyos. Move to pass. I have a motion by Alderman Burnett to move to pass.

All those in favor? Aye. Aye.

Any opposed? If you didn't share the ayes, have it, and good luck to you, sir.

[Speaker 35] (1:50:54 - 1:50:54)
All right, thank you.

[Speaker 38] (1:50:54 - 1:50:54)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (1:50:56 - 1:51:22)
Now, we're in the middle of page 7, document number 20261, 31st Ward, ordinance referred on November 13th of 19. Common address, 2535 North Laramie Avenue, and the change request, RS3, residential single unit detached house district to a B31 community shopping district.

[Speaker 32] (1:51:22 - 1:52:29)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Daniel Box. I'm an attorney with the law offices at Sam Banks, located at 221 North LaSalle.

I'm here today on behalf of the applicant, Esquina del Sabor Catracho, Inc. Present with me is Ms. Doris Molina, the president of the corporation. The applicant will be the lessee of the subject property located at 2535 North Laramie Avenue.

The property is currently improved with a one-story commercial retail building. The applicant is proposing to relocate her existing restaurant, which constitutes a general restaurant use, within the commercial retail space of the existing building. Apart from the interior build-out necessary to permit her restaurant's business operations, no physical changes are proposed to the building.

On-site parking for five vehicles will continue to be provided at the rear of the on-site lot. In order to permit the project, the applicant is seeking a zoning change from an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to a B3-1 community shopping district. We have worked with the local community and Alderman Cardona on this project.

The Alderman's office has provided a letter of support for it, which I would like to provide now.

[Speaker 1] (1:52:31 - 1:52:45)
We do have the Alderman here too, but we'll take both. So you met with the Alderman and community group. We have a letter of support, but let's hear from the Alderman himself.

[Speaker 26] (1:52:47 - 1:53:13)
Thank you, Chairman. So when I met with the owner, she told me she was just relocating to the other side of the street. I told her to do the best she can to get the zoning representation and so forth, and I talked to some of the residents surrounding the property and they were okay with it.

So I move forward for the zoning change for this property.

[Speaker 1] (1:53:16 - 1:53:27)
Okay, so just for the record, let me clarify. So the applicant is actually the lessee and not the owner of the property. Is that correct?

[Speaker 26] (1:53:27 - 1:53:56)
Right, she is the lessee. But the thing is, the owner, in order for her to move into the property, she's been paying. She kind of did things backwards.

So she got the lease first and then started doing her business not knowing that the zoning had to be changed. So she had to close down the business and then basically start from scratch. So I worked with her and the owner so we could open up the business legitimately.

[Speaker 1] (1:53:58 - 1:54:05)
So I'm not familiar with the makeup of North Laramie, but you are, obviously. So it's surrounded by residential?

[Speaker 26] (1:54:06 - 1:54:33)
Yes, it's surrounded by residential, but there's a lot of mixed-use apartments or buildings. And you have one-story commercial small businesses around there that are vacant. And so what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to bring more businesses and attract other businesses so we could have, we could bring it back to life.

[Speaker 1] (1:54:35 - 1:54:38)
Okay, Chairman. All right, Alderman Lopez, question?

[Speaker 8] (1:54:39 - 1:55:21)
Thank you, Chairman. Actually, my question is, I don't know if the department or the lawyer would like to answer, but I appreciate Alderman Cardona trying to bring vitality to Laramie. This is something that we've seen in other areas where landlords aren't necessarily truthful to their future tenants on whether or not what they're hoping to do is possible based on zoning.

Do we know if the landlord knew he was renting out a storefront that wasn't legally able to be a business? Or was this part of some down zone previously where we've seen where, I know in my ward, we've down zoned things that they should know and don't tell anybody?

[Speaker 32] (1:55:23 - 1:55:27)
To our knowledge, we don't believe that the landlord knew that or did that intentionally.

[Speaker 1] (1:55:29 - 1:55:35)
All right, let's hear from the department. All right, hold on. We'll start with the alderman first.

[Speaker 26] (1:55:36 - 1:56:05)
Point of information. The landlord was trying just to get a tenant in there, did not know that the zoning had to be changed. And with her case, she thought that she could just move across the street, not knowing the particulars of zoning and so forth.

And so she wasn't misconceived or anything. She was just trying to move her location. The owner did not know that there was supposed to be a zoning change because he's an older individual.

He just wants to get his location rented.

[Speaker 1] (1:56:06 - 1:56:06)
Okay.

[Speaker 26] (1:56:07 - 1:56:07)
Department?

[Speaker 30] (1:56:08 - 1:56:46)
Alderman Steve Valenziano, Department of Planning and Development. This half-mile stretch of Laramie between Diversity and Fullerton is almost all zoned B3, except for this one block. And this was an old corner store, so it was a legal nonconforming business that was zoned RS3.

So this would just make the entire half-mile of Laramie, if they were to fill in this little gap, would make the whole half-mile a business zoned district. So we believe everything was done in good faith. And the owner actually gave the authority for the rezoning to the— Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:56:47 - 1:56:47)
Thanks, Steve.

[Speaker 8] (1:56:48 - 1:56:48)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:56:48 - 1:56:49)
Other questions?

[Speaker 38] (1:56:50 - 1:56:50)
Sorry.

[Speaker 8] (1:56:51 - 1:57:30)
You know, my only concern about this is that we see this particularly in communities that are older, immigrant communities where we're not necessarily familiar with the zoning. And, you know, I have a storefront slash two-flat building, and I think I could just rent to whomever. We've seen this in West Englewood where landlords knew that they were not necessarily zoned correctly and made would-be tenants spend thousands without telling them.

So I just wanted to make sure that, you know, if this is a part of a broader pattern that needs to be addressed or something, maybe that's something that this committee should look at later down the road. That's all. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:57:31 - 1:57:35)
Thank you, Alderman. Alderman Brendan Riley.

[Speaker 5] (1:57:36 - 1:58:28)
Thank you, Chairman. Just to follow up on my colleague Alderman Lopez's suggestion, perhaps the Department of Planning could work with individual aldermanic offices to help promote, at least at a very high level, some of the key components of the zoning code so that people know that they should go and check their zoning classification before entering into lease agreements or arrangements with tenants to make sure they are compliant with the law. I think my colleague is right, especially with older property owners, they're not as familiar with the nuances of city zoning code. So there might be an educational component here that we could work with the administration on because even in the Central Business District, we do run into this from time to time.

[Speaker 1] (1:58:29 - 1:58:32)
So thank you. I agree, Alderman, and BACP needs to be involved too.

[Speaker 25] (1:58:32 - 1:58:32)
Indeed.

[Speaker 1] (1:58:33 - 1:59:29)
All right. Any other questions? Can I get a motion on this?

So moved. Alderman Cary Austin moves to pass on this. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? The Chair, the ayes have it.

Item is passed. Good luck to you. All right.

Now we're on the top of page 8. Moving on. Top of page 8, 20247 is the document number, and it's in the 33rd Ward.

The ordinance was referred on November 13th of this year. Change request, RS3, residential single unit detached house district to an RT4, residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district. Okay.

Mr. Moore.

[Speaker 6] (1:59:29 - 2:00:03)
Good morning. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name, for the record, is Thomas S.

Moore, and with me today is George Moncef, who is the owner of this property. This is a typical situation where the city believes it's a two-flat, and he bought this thinking it was a three-flat. He has not rented it, but he would like to rent the basement unit, legalize and rent the basement unit.

So he's been through a community process with the alderman's office, and we have a letter of support from the alderman, and we request your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (2:00:06 - 2:00:34)
Mr. Moore, just like the last application, it can happen from the commercial end, it can happen at the residential. We bought something, we didn't know it was a legal two-flat or it was a three-flat. So I know we're working with the department on this issue to try to make it easier and still legalize whatever is out there.

So I know we do have a letter of support from Alderman Rodriguez-Sanchez. Any questions? Yes, Alderman Kerry Austin.

[Speaker 21] (2:00:37 - 2:00:39)
Is it a basement apartment or a garden apartment?

[Speaker 6] (2:00:42 - 2:00:53)
Basement. It's a full basement. Well, it's a full basement with a seven or more foot, eight-foot ceiling.

[Speaker 1] (2:00:55 - 2:01:07)
Any other questions? If not, can I say Alderman Kerry Austin moves do pass on this item. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? Then you Chair, the ayes have it, and this item is passed.

[Speaker 6] (2:01:08 - 2:01:09)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (2:01:10 - 2:02:20)
Okay. Now we're in the middle of page eight, and this document is 20236, 35th Ward. The ordinance was referred on November 13th of 19.

The common address is 3566 West Velden Avenue, and at the request of the attorney, they're asking to defer this item. So can I get a motion to defer? Alderman James Kaplan moves to defer.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

Hearing none, this item is deferred. Okay. Bottom of page eight.

Document number 20238, 35th Ward. Ordinance referred on November 13th of this year, 19. Common address 3127 North Central Park Avenue, and the change request.

RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RM4.5 residential multi-unit district. Again, Mr. Thomas S. Moore.

[Speaker 6] (2:02:21 - 2:03:04)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name, for the record, is Thomas Moore, and with me today is Mr. Jason Krinsky, who is the owner of this property. This is a dilapidated property that he hopes to improve with a new construction.

The block has mixed use single families, but also many multi-family and two and three flats, and he would like to build a state-of-the-art three flat here. He has been through a community process, and we have a letter of support from Alderman Carlos Ramirez Rosa, and we'd appreciate your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (2:03:05 - 2:04:02)
We do have a letter from Carlos Rosa on file, and do we have questions from committee members? Hearing none, all the Mineralli moves do pass on this item. All those in favor?

Aye. Aye. Any opposed?

Hearing none, opinion chair, the ayes have it, the item is passed. All right. All right.

So now we're middle of page nine. Document number 20240 in the 37th Ward. The ordinance was referred on November 13th of this year.

Common address, 1325 North Central Avenue. That's not Central Park, right? Central?

Okay. Change request, RS3, residential single unit detached house district to a B11 neighborhood shopping district. Good afternoon.

[Speaker 23] (2:04:03 - 2:04:04)
Hi, my name is Ross Collard.

[Speaker 1] (2:04:04 - 2:04:04)
I'm the owner.

[Speaker 23] (2:04:04 - 2:04:05)
Say it again.

[Speaker 1] (2:04:05 - 2:04:07)
Ross Collard. Could you spell the last name?

[Speaker 23] (2:04:08 - 2:04:09)
C-O-L-L-A-R-D.

[Speaker 1] (2:04:10 - 2:04:10)
Thank you.

[Speaker 23] (2:04:11 - 2:04:54)
Thank you, sir. And I'm the owner of the property. Essentially, I'm not similar from the last couple of cases, in that when I purchased the property about a year and a half ago, it was a mixed use building, four units, three apartments, and one convenience store.

The store was vacant at the time. I tried to rent it this summer, and he went in for his license and was denied because it was an RS3, because it had already been converted over, even though this had been a convenience store back at least until the 80s. So we're trying to legalize the use of the convenience store by changing the zoning from RS3 to B11.

[Speaker 1] (2:04:55 - 2:04:57)
I get the logic in it. How long was the store vacant?

[Speaker 23] (2:04:58 - 2:05:15)
2013. I don't know if it was vacant that long. It was the last time there was a license.

So I bought it in 2018. The previous owner had passed away, and I know there was some linkage from the apartment upstairs, which was one of the reasons.

[Speaker 1] (2:05:15 - 2:05:17)
So you met with the alderman, I presume?

[Speaker 23] (2:05:17 - 2:05:38)
I did meet with the alderman first, and then she sent me over to the zoning office and said, this is the process we need to go through. Did the application and sent out the letters. I didn't get any feedback from the letters.

However, as I've been doing work over there, almost every pedestrian that comes by asks when we're going to open the convenience store up.

[Speaker 1] (2:05:39 - 2:05:44)
And we have a letter of support? Do we have a letter of support from the alderman?

[Speaker 23] (2:05:44 - 2:05:53)
No. I didn't know I needed to get a letter of support. I mean, I met with her before and kind of went through it with her.

All right.

[Speaker 1] (2:05:53 - 2:05:54)
Alderman Brendan Reilly.

[Speaker 5] (2:05:54 - 2:06:05)
Chairman, thank you. Did you follow up with Chairman Mitts after the zoning notice went out and you didn't receive any negative feedback? Did you touch base again with the alderman?

[Speaker 14] (2:06:06 - 2:06:06)
No, I didn't.

[Speaker 5] (2:06:10 - 2:06:27)
Knowing Alderman Mitts, I know she's very supportive of bringing new retail to her ward. But that is the typical process, that you would tender at least a letter of support to the committee staff or have the alderman present to speak on behalf of your item. All right.

[Speaker 1] (2:06:27 - 2:07:04)
So what we're going to do? Hold that, Chairman? I think we're going to hold it.

But we're going to try to get in touch with Alderman Mitts. Okay. I mean, we really need a letter of support from the alderman on this, especially because, I mean, this is a business, you know, and I know she's chairman of business and licensing, so I want to make sure that we have her support.

And then I would presume there's no liquor in this thing? No, there isn't. Okay, because B-1-1 wouldn't fit that one anyways.

But if you want to be patient with us for a second, we're going to try to reach out to her and then we'll call. So we're going to hold this item.

[Speaker 23] (2:07:04 - 2:07:05)
You're going to hold it for right now?

[Speaker 1] (2:07:05 - 2:07:24)
We're going to hold it. We're going to go through some more items. We're going to try to reach out to the alderman.

But we will not. We got to get some contact with her. We'll figure out next steps in a second.

So if you bear with us. Thank you. Thank you, sir.

So we're going to hold this item in committee right now.

[Speaker 21] (2:07:24 - 2:07:26)
Let me get back to it.

[Speaker 1] (2:07:26 - 2:07:49)
Okay, bottom of page nine. Moving on to bottom of page nine. Number 20254, 39th Ward Ordinance referred on November 13th of 2019.

Common address, 6246 North Pulaski Road. Change request, B-1-1 Neighborhood Shopping District to a B-1-2 Neighborhood Shopping District.

[Speaker 9] (2:07:49 - 2:09:04)
Paul? Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the board. My name is Paul Kolpak with offices at 6767 North Milwaukee Avenue.

I represent the applicant Valentino Cusci in this matter. As a way of a background, this property is a 25 by 124-foot lot, zone B-1-1. We're requesting a zoning change to B-1-2.

Back in January 23rd of this year, we appeared before this committee and rezoned the 50-foot adjacent lot to B-1-2. What we're asking to do is to have the rezoning to B-1-2, consolidate the two lots so that we would have a 75 by 124. We would then be able to construct nine dwelling units with 11 parking spaces with approximately 2,628 square feet of commercial space on the first floor.

We had a meeting for the first zoning back at the end of 18, and we had another meeting approximately two months ago with the community, and we have their support. I believe there's a letter of support from Alderman Nugent in the file.

[Speaker 21] (2:09:13 - 2:09:13)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:09:20 - 2:09:23)
Paul, do you have the letter from Alderman Nugent?

[Speaker 9] (2:09:25 - 2:09:26)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (2:09:34 - 2:10:10)
There's no objection to this one. All right. Questions from committee members?

We do have a letter of support, or no objection, from Samantha Nugent in the 39th Ward. All right, hearing no questions, Alderman Brendan Riley moves to pass. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? Seeing the Chair of the ayes have, the item is passed.

Paul, one quick note. You said that previous there was a property adjacent. What was that address?

The total is nine units, but we're talking about how many?

[Speaker 9] (2:10:10 - 2:10:23)
The total is 75. If we get this zoning, we'll consolidate 62, 50, and 46 together to create a 75 by 124 lot. Right.

And that gives us the.

[Speaker 1] (2:10:23 - 2:10:26)
So the narrative includes, is bigger than that one address?

[Speaker 9] (2:10:27 - 2:10:27)
Correct.

[Speaker 1] (2:10:27 - 2:10:30)
Okay. I just, it was a little confusing there for me.

[Speaker 2] (2:10:30 - 2:10:32)
Okay. Thank you. Thank you, sir.

[Speaker 1] (2:10:36 - 2:10:45)
All right. We're going to skip out for a second, and we're going to go to the top of page 18, and this is for Alderman Michelle Smith.

[Speaker 8] (2:10:45 - 2:10:47)
Let me just see what we've got here.

[Speaker 1] (2:10:49 - 2:11:29)
Oh, yes, and just for the record, this is the public testimony period from Alan Malice, very much in support of this item. And that item is 20189, 43rd Ward, ordinance referred on September 18th of this year, common address 2604 through 2742 North Sheffield Avenue, and the change request, residential plan development number 52 to B32 community shopping district, then to residential plan development 52 as amended. All right.

[Speaker 13] (2:11:29 - 2:12:10)
Good morning, Chairman Tunney and members of the committee. My name is Graham Grady. I'm an attorney with the law firm of Taft, Stettinius and Hollister.

My law partner, Joseph Catuso, who principally handled this matter is unable to be here this morning due to problems on the Metro train line. I am joined this morning by Lee Prater of the Chicago Housing Authority, Christina Martinez Shahagan of the Chicago Housing Authority, and Grace Rapp of Ratio Architects, our private architect. This is an application by the Chicago Housing Authority to amend plan development 52 by first classifying the subject property as a B2-3 neighborhood mixed use district.

[Speaker 1] (2:12:10 - 2:12:17)
Wait, wait, you said B2-3. The narrative says B32. What are we doing?

[Speaker 13] (2:12:19 - 2:12:23)
That is correct, and Alderman Tunney, I thank you for your diligent and careful reading.

[Speaker 1] (2:12:23 - 2:12:26)
Carrie Austin caught me on it, so I'm going to catch you on this one.

[Speaker 13] (2:12:27 - 2:12:27)
I thank the Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (2:12:27 - 2:12:34)
I thank all of you for the great job that you do under sometimes trying circumstances, so forgive my digression. I need some recreational stuff.

[Speaker 13] (2:12:37 - 2:13:06)
No comment there. All right. Continue, continue.

Thank you. Correct. To a B3-2, I apologize for the error.

Then we're going back to the residential plan development. And then to plan development 52 as amended. Correct.

This application was considered and recommended for approval by the Chicago Plan Commission at its hearing on November 21st. I ask that the record of those proceedings of the plan commission be incorporated into the record before the committee today.

[Speaker 1] (2:13:08 - 2:13:18)
Alderman Carrie Austin moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Hearing none, the ayes have it. Records are incorporated.

Thank you.

[Speaker 13] (2:13:19 - 2:15:33)
The subject property is located at 2604-2742 North Sheffield Avenue in the Lincoln Park neighborhood. Contains approximately 164,945 square feet of net site area, or approximately 3.7 acres. And is approximately 250 feet from the diversity avenue L stop, making the subject property a transit-oriented development site.

Two 11-story brick residential buildings containing a total of 394 senior dwelling units presently exist on the subject property that were built in the late 1960s, between which is a surface level parking lot containing 29 off-street parking spaces. Working with co-developer Pearl Developers, the applicant proposes to construct a six-story building link, linking the two buildings together that will contain 80 non-age restricted, non-senior dwelling units. Both existing buildings will be extensively renovated as part of the proposed project, and the amenity spaces for the seniors in both existing buildings will be relocated to the new link building, making way for 11 additional senior dwelling units in the existing buildings.

With the 394 existing senior units and the 80 new non-age restricted family units, there will be a total of 485 dwelling units on the subject property served by 45 off-street parking spaces. Three off-street loading berths and 110 bicycle spaces will be provided. Of the total 485 dwelling units, 20 of the new non-age restricted family units will be market rate, meaning that the remaining 465 units will be affordable.

A community meeting was held at which time area residents and organizations expressed support of the product of the development. Alderman Smith is here today to speak for herself with regard to the project. Our development team is available to answer any questions that you may have.

And as you've seen, the PowerPoint is available containing the detailed architectural drawings and rendering as prepared by our project applicant. And we stand ready to answer your questions. Thank Alderman Smith.

[Speaker 1] (2:15:34 - 2:15:41)
Okay. Before we get to Alderman Smith, I'm going to ask the department, we're going to clarify something. Yeah.

[Speaker 5] (2:15:42 - 2:15:58)
So the correct district should be, and is a B2-3 and it was noticed correctly and was approved correctly by plan commission, but the application is incorrect. So that just has to be updated. The application was filed as a B3-2, but everything else after that was done correctly.

[Speaker 13] (2:15:58 - 2:16:05)
So we're going to B2-3 fast. Correct. You just have to change your application.

Very good.

[Speaker 1] (2:16:05 - 2:16:09)
We're all on the same page.

[Speaker 17] (2:16:09 - 2:16:10)
Okay. Okay.

[Speaker 13] (2:16:11 - 2:16:14)
And me as well. And I apologize.

[Speaker 17] (2:16:14 - 2:16:19)
I'm reading the text. So we got it straight. Thank you.

[Speaker 13] (2:16:19 - 2:16:20)
Thank you. Zoning administrator Murphy.

[Speaker 17] (2:16:21 - 2:16:21)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:16:23 - 2:16:31)
So obviously this went through the plan commission and I'm going to hear from Alderman Michelle Smith. I think this is a very innovative project.

[Speaker 17] (2:16:32 - 2:18:40)
So thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. We are very excited about this development. This is the first CHA building built in Lincoln Park in at least 40 years.

So we're very excited about this. This is a, the two sides of this development are a senior building, a CHA senior building that was built in the late 60s. It's going to have 10 more units.

So it's almost 500 senior units, a very active community that we work with a lot. And in between them will be this six-story building. The first two floors of Rich are improved amenities for the seniors.

So they'll now have a really big sort of multipurpose space that you can use for meals as well as activities, much better laundry facilities, computer spaces, a gardening room. It's really nice. And the seniors were very active in helping to plan this.

And on top of it is a family building of 80 units, 60 of which will be affordable with some extra family units. So we will be bringing some new family units to this area, threes, twos, ones. It's in the Agassiz school district.

So they'll be going, you know, people go to a good public school. And, you know, we're very excited about the design. Our community really embraced this project and said that this was a good thing.

And all I can say is we're delighted with the design, the amenities for the, for the people here. It is very close to the diversity L stop is really the L stop. That's that's here.

But also it's a couple blocks away from the Halstead bus. So we're very satisfied that the TOD will be a, is a, is a good, a good thing here. So I asked the committee's support and of course would entertain any questions.

[Speaker 4] (2:18:40 - 2:19:38)
We're very excited about this questions for the Alderman or the CHA folks. Alderman Walter Burnett. Thank you very much.

First of all, I want to commend the Alderman and also CHA. I think there's a beautiful, beautiful development. I think this is a great idea to have intergenerational folks living together.

Also, I think it's great that CHA is utilizing all of the excess property that they have. CHA has a lot of excess property all over the city. And I'm saying that because I have a development too, which is 1633 West Madison.

It's a very, very large footprint. And there's a lot of vacant land right around there where you can do some of the same thing. I don't, some of the same things that you're doing here.

So I commend you on this, commend it, commend the effort. Who is the developer?

[Speaker 28] (2:19:41 - 2:19:48)
Lee Prater with CHA. We are a JV partnership, CHA and Pearl.

[Speaker 4] (2:19:48 - 2:20:03)
All right. So you should come over to my area. You know that we have TIF money.

We can make it happen. All right. 1633 West Madison.

So I want to flatter Alderman Smith by copying off of her.

[Speaker 1] (2:20:04 - 2:20:25)
Thank you. Okay. All right.

Other questions for the Alderman or the team? Okay. Before we move to pass, I know I was on the plan commission.

And if I'm not mistaken, Alderman, they're renovating the entirety of the existing building. So anybody who lives there and they'll not be relocated.

[Speaker 17] (2:20:25 - 2:20:41)
No one's being relocated because they're building 10 new units. They're going to sort of phase the rehab. So those new units will be filled and then, you know, tier by tier.

So the whole place is being renovated and the residents, they have a very strong resident council there.

[Speaker 1] (2:20:41 - 2:20:43)
I know they do. I'm a neighbor.

[Speaker 17] (2:20:43 - 2:20:49)
Yes, they do. And they are being pleased. We love them.

[Speaker 1] (2:20:50 - 2:20:51)
You and I are retiring there.

[Speaker 17] (2:20:51 - 2:20:52)
That's it.

[Speaker 1] (2:20:52 - 2:20:54)
Family and the family portion. That's it.

[Speaker 17] (2:20:54 - 2:20:55)
That's all right.

[Speaker 1] (2:20:55 - 2:21:09)
It's a really, it's a handsome project. Very innovative. Can I get a motion by Alderman Riley moves to pass as revised.

All those in favor. Aye. Any opposed.

The ayes have it. And this item is passed as revised chairman and members.

[Speaker 13] (2:21:09 - 2:21:10)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:21:10 - 2:21:39)
All right. So I'm going to read this, the next item. And then I'm going to ask Alderman Burnett to come.

It's in the 44th ward. Pardon me. Oh, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry. I got ahead of myself. You know what?

Let's do it anyway. So we're going to stick to the deferred agenda. And this is item middle of page 18.

[Speaker 24] (2:21:40 - 2:21:41)
Oh, you.

[Speaker 1] (2:21:48 - 2:21:49)
It'll be an hour.

[Speaker 4] (2:21:49 - 2:22:22)
Okay. Which one is that? Okay.

Well, item number 20051-T1 in the 44th ward. One is referred 61219. Common address 3347-49 North South Port Avenue.

The changes from a B3-2 community shopping district to a B3-5 community shopping district. Counselor.

[Speaker 6] (2:22:23 - 2:24:26)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name for the record is Thomas S. Moore.

And with me today on the developer's team, the comptroller is Mr. Dan Cahill. This is a project. It's a property that's been underutilized for many years.

It's a TOD project. It's right near the South Port L. The area has had a lot of development of very high-end condos.

But there was a hue and cry for some smaller units, TOD units that would meet the demand of millennials. We had several meetings with the local community steering committee. And we had an independent community meeting.

And we've been through that process. And there have been many changes. Alderman Tunney insisted on many changes.

And we finally came up with a consensus building that has 27 units, all either efficiencies or one bedrooms. And it's only a few hundred feet from the L. And there will be three affordable units on site.

And we have Alderman Tunney's support, and we'd request your support as well. I'm sorry, and thank you for the reminder. Because this went through many changes, we did yesterday, my staff met with the zoning department, and we submitted a substitute narrative and plans.

And we'd ask that those be accepted to move forward on. And ordinance, excuse me. Substitute ordinance plans and narrative.

[Speaker 4] (2:24:29 - 2:24:34)
So Alderman Rowley moved to pass on the substitute ordinance. All in favor, signify by saying aye.

[Speaker 38] (2:24:34 - 2:24:35)
Aye.

[Speaker 4] (2:24:35 - 2:24:58)
Those opposed, the ayes have it. Okay. The substitute, so Alderman Carey also moved to accept the substitute narrative plans and for the type one application.

All those in favor, signify by saying aye. Aye. Those opposed, in the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it.

Proceed, Councilor.

[Speaker 6] (2:24:59 - 2:25:14)
Well, as I said before, we've been through an extensive community process. And this is a TOD project. It does fit in at this location.

And we have the support of the Alderman. We'd ask your support as well.

[Speaker 4] (2:25:15 - 2:25:19)
Any witnesses? Seeing no witnesses, Alderman Tunney.

[Speaker 1] (2:25:19 - 2:25:56)
Thank you, Chairman Burnett. But I want to just clarify. So the original zoning application was for a B35.

Right. Which did not meet with community support. That's right.

And then we, this, it was a B35T1. But that being said, it was not in scale with some of the surrounding developments around TODs. So the ordinance is a B33T1.

That we will be passing. And the T1 has a total number of units of 27 units.

[Speaker 6] (2:25:56 - 2:25:56)
That is correct.

[Speaker 1] (2:25:56 - 2:25:59)
Versus the original plan was, I think, 35?

[Speaker 6] (2:25:59 - 2:26:00)
About 35, yes.

[Speaker 1] (2:26:01 - 2:26:49)
And I think Mr. Moore did a good job of explaining the process with the community. And the need for more affordable housing for our community is not necessarily the same as other communities. But Southport Corridor has really blossomed in a way that has become a lot more expensive.

Both in the residential and the commercial. And our hope is the density around Southport decreases because of larger single family homes. That we're adding density as a planning tool to maintain the kind of density that we need in our neighborhood.

To support TOD developments and the corresponding business activity. We just need more bodies. And so I'd ask for your support with that explanation.

[Speaker 4] (2:26:51 - 2:27:13)
Thank you. Thank you, Alderman Tunney. Any comments from the body?

Alderman Riley moved to pass with the substitute narrative and plans. All those in favor signify by stating aye. Aye.

Those opposed, in the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it. Congratulations, Alderman Tunney.

[Speaker 6] (2:27:13 - 2:27:14)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 4] (2:27:14 - 2:27:19)
And pass as amended. Congratulations, Alderman Tunney.

[Speaker 38] (2:27:21 - 2:27:22)
So you have one more.

[Speaker 4] (2:27:22 - 2:27:23)
No, I'll wait.

[Speaker 1] (2:27:29 - 2:27:58)
Let's go back to the regular agenda. And we are at the top of page 10. Alright, top of page 10, item number 20246T1 in the 40th Ward.

Ordinance referred on November 13th of this year. Common address 1767 West Rose Hill Drive. Change request.

C11 Neighborhood Commercial District to a B23 Neighborhood Mixed Use District.

[Speaker 6] (2:27:59 - 2:28:42)
Mr. Moore. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name for the record is Thomas S.

Moore. And with me momentarily will be Alan Candia, who is one of the principals of the LLC that owns this property. Mr. Candia went through a community process in this ward and there were changes that evolved through that process and ended up with a consensus 13-unit building that would be facilitated by this B23 zoning. And we have a letter of support from Alderman Vasquez and we'd request your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (2:28:43 - 2:28:45)
We have a substitute narrative?

[Speaker 6] (2:28:46 - 2:29:01)
I'm sorry, we do have a substitute narrative and plans which have been filed with the zoning department and we'd request that those be put before you.

[Speaker 1] (2:29:01 - 2:29:25)
Alderman Riley moves to accept the substantive narrative and plans for the Type 1 application. All those in favor? Aye.

Opposed? The ayes have it and the substantive narrative and plans are accepted. Alderman Osterman?

Pardon me? Do we want to hear? Did you explain?

So you're finished?

[Speaker 6] (2:29:26 - 2:29:31)
I think so. It's a 13-unit building that's been through a community process and has the community and the aldermen support.

[Speaker 1] (2:29:32 - 2:29:33)
Okay. Alderman Osterman, question.

[Speaker 25] (2:29:34 - 2:29:40)
So is this at Rose Hill and Ravenswood? Wait, wait, wait.

[Speaker 36] (2:29:41 - 2:29:53)
Hi, I'm Alan Candy. How are you? Yes, it is not exactly on the corner of Ravenswood and Rose Hill.

It's pretty close to it. It's about maybe 50, 60 feet away from there.

[Speaker 25] (2:29:54 - 2:29:55)
Keep the existing facade?

[Speaker 36] (2:29:57 - 2:30:05)
No, I think you're thinking of the house that's being built there. It was a tombstone factory that was being converted into a single family. We're actually the lot next door.

[Speaker 25] (2:30:05 - 2:30:20)
It's a vacant site. Got it. And last question.

What percentage of affordability are you putting on site? We're paying into the ARO fund there with the permission of Alderman Vasquez.

[Speaker 1] (2:30:23 - 2:30:26)
How many units would have been required? It would have just been one.

[Speaker 36] (2:30:27 - 2:30:33)
We're doing like large three-bedroom condominiums. They're like 2,000 square foot each. Cool.

[Speaker 25] (2:30:35 - 2:30:41)
Last question. Because I go that neck of the woods. You're building on Ashland.

Is that occupied?

[Speaker 1] (2:30:45 - 2:30:50)
I'm supportive. Great. Thank you.

Alderman Brendan Riley has a question.

[Speaker 5] (2:30:51 - 2:31:00)
Thank you, Chairman. I just thought, when you went into the community process, what was the original proposal that you would put forth? I'm sorry, can you repeat the question?

[Speaker 22] (2:31:00 - 2:31:01)
Sure.

[Speaker 5] (2:31:02 - 2:31:11)
When you entered the community process, I guess, how has the proposal changed as a result of the community process?

[Speaker 36] (2:31:12 - 2:31:39)
Oh, okay. Good question. Originally, we had a four-story building that was lot line to lot line.

With some of the feedback from the community, they wanted to step down the west side of the building because the building to the west of me was slightly smaller. But the building to the west was the same height as the building we proposed. So we actually stepped down the top of the building going to the building to the west.

[Speaker 5] (2:31:40 - 2:31:46)
So that was a substantial change that you made through the community process. And that's what garnered the support of Alderman Vasquez.

[Speaker 36] (2:31:46 - 2:31:51)
That was the recommendation of Alderman Vasquez on the feedback that we got from him.

[Speaker 5] (2:31:51 - 2:31:53)
Very good. Thank you. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 36] (2:31:54 - 2:31:54)
Questions?

[Speaker 1] (2:31:55 - 2:32:29)
Just a narrative, again, about this affordability issue that Alderman Osterman has brought up. The department, as you well know, are trying to figure out what we're doing with what we call luxury condominiums and how do we have an affordable component in a condominium development that has large expenses, whether it be maintenance or taxes. We want to make sure that there's affordability, but I think we have challenges as we move forward with the ARO.

So I look forward to your leadership on that issue.

[Speaker 25] (2:32:32 - 2:33:17)
Yeah, my question was more local because there's 50 different aldermen with 50 different opinions about ARO and what they want to see and where they want to see it. A lot of times the rubber hits the road when it's in this committee, so I'm curious to see what people say and then how things pan out. But that area is a lot of single-family homes.

There are some bigger buildings. Edgewater Hospital is going to come online. Candias have built a building on Clark Street that's come online, so it's an area that is experiencing positive growth, and I think this stretch, I think, will benefit from it.

There has not been a lot of condominium development in the last 10 years, and I think that's starting to pick up, which I think is a good thing for our city.

[Speaker 38] (2:33:19 - 2:33:19)
Great.

[Speaker 1] (2:33:19 - 2:33:29)
Thank you, Alderman. Any other questions? Hearing none, no questions.

Alderman Brendan Riley moves to do pass with substantive narrative and plans. All those in favor?

[Speaker 38] (2:33:29 - 2:33:29)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (2:33:30 - 2:33:34)
Any opposed? Opinion, the Chair of the Ayes have it with substantive narrative and plans.

[Speaker 6] (2:33:34 - 2:33:35)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (2:33:35 - 2:33:58)
All right, I'm going to ask. Brendan, you got a few minutes for me? Okay, so we're going to be at the top of page 11, and we're back to the 44th Ward with three, three, three.

Thank you. Top of page 11.

[Speaker 5] (2:34:07 - 2:34:37)
Okay, we have document number 20250-T1 in the 44th Ward, ordinance referred 11-13-2019, document 0201-8483, common address 3757 North Sheffield Avenue. Applicant is 957 Grace Acquisitions, LLC, represented by Attorney Thomas Moore. Change request is a B3-2 Community Shopping District to a B2-3 Neighborhood Mixed Use District.

[Speaker 6] (2:34:40 - 2:35:49)
Mr. Moore. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name, as said for the record, is Thomas S.

Moore, and with me today is one of the principals of the LLC that owns this, Mr. Michael Lerner. This actually, there is a building right next door that is in construction that is being built and went through a long community process, and then this lot became available and would allow 10 additional units to be added to the existing, or the building that's being built, and so the applicant went to the alderman and showed him this possibility and went through a community process, and everyone supported the idea of adding these additional 10 units.

There will be, in the combined building, there will be five affordable on-site units, and we have the alderman's support, and we'd request your support as well.

[Speaker 5] (2:35:50 - 2:36:41)
Any questions from committee members? Alderman Austin moves to pass. All those in favor?

Opposed? The chairs, the ayes have it. Thank you very much.

Okay, the next item is number 20244 in the 44th Ward, ordinance referred on 11-13-19. The common address is 3608-3610 North Southport Avenue. The change request is a B3-2 Community Shopping District to a C1-2 Neighborhood Commercial District, and the attorney of record is Katrina McGuire.

[Speaker 28] (2:36:44 - 2:36:50)
Good morning, members of the Board. My name is Talar Berberian from Thompson-Coburn with offices at 55 East Monroe in Chicago.

[Speaker 5] (2:36:51 - 2:36:53)
Can you speak more directly into the microphone, please?

[Speaker 28] (2:36:53 - 2:37:31)
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm here with Candice Daniolo, who is the owner of the business located at 3608-3610 North Southport. The proposed rezoning here is in order to permit the existing business on-site.

There are no changes proposed to either building on-site. Candice runs a dog daycare, and she is proposing to expand her use to provide overnight boarding and outdoor use, and that is the purpose for this rezoning. So if any members have questions, we're happy to answer them.

[Speaker 5] (2:37:32 - 2:38:28)
As someone who just boarded two dogs, I can tell you there's a need for increased competition given the pricing. So I wish you the best of luck. It costs more to board dogs than it does to board people.

So do we have any questions from members of committee? Alderman Burnett moves to pass. All those in favor?

All those opposed? In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it. The ordinance is approved.

Our next item is number 20243-T1 in the 44th Ward. Ordinance referred on 11-13-2019. The common address is 3500-3502 North Clark Street.

The change request is a B3-2 Community Shopping District to a B3-3 Community Shopping District. And we have our counsel from Thompson-Coburn here.

[Speaker 28] (2:38:29 - 2:39:16)
Good afternoon again. Talar Berberian from Thompson-Coburn with offices at 55 East Monroe. I'm here with the development team, with Danny Zutek from the applicant, along with Daniel Campbell from Space Architects and Planners, and folks from the Culver's team, which will be the retail user on the ground floor of this proposed development.

As Alderman Riley stated, the proposal is to rezone from the existing B3-2 to the B3-3, which will permit the TOD use of this building, as well as the establishment of 18 residential units on the second through fourth floors of this building. Again, happy to answer questions if there are any.

[Speaker 5] (2:39:17 - 2:39:18)
Well, then Tony, do you wish to speak to this project?

[Speaker 28] (2:39:20 - 2:39:29)
Oh, I'm sorry. Just to say that we also met with the local neighborhood group and have been working with the Alderman's office on this project as well.

[Speaker 1] (2:39:29 - 2:40:17)
Thank you, Chairman and fellow members of the committee. We've met for years on this corner. This project, I think we approved it a number of years ago, and it never really got built.

But we're back. It's been a vacant Chase Bank, and it's right a block from Wrigley Field, and it also does qualify for the TOD. So they've met again, and we're hungry, no pun intended, to get this site going.

Culvers will not have a drive-through, will not have any window pickups or something like that. And I think just for the record, I think there's affordability as part of this?

[Speaker 28] (2:40:17 - 2:40:20)
That's correct. There will be two affordable units on site as part of this project.

[Speaker 1] (2:40:20 - 2:40:26)
So with that, it has met extensively with the community, has neighborhood support and my support.

[Speaker 5] (2:40:27 - 2:40:40)
Any questions from committee members? Alderman Burnett, moves do pass. All those in favor?

All those opposed? In the chair, the ayes have it. The item is approved.

[Speaker 1] (2:40:46 - 2:41:21)
Okay, so I've been noticed up that we need to take a five-minute recess. We've got some audio mechanical and probably some bathroom break. Okay, so we'll give it about five, seven minutes, okay?

Thank you. Okay, the committee on zoning is reconvened. And okay, we are on page 12.

[Speaker 8] (2:41:32 - 2:41:32)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (2:41:40 - 2:41:51)
All right, bottom of page 12. Document number 20241T1 in the 49th Ward. That ordinance was referred on November 13th of 19.

[Speaker 21] (2:41:51 - 2:41:52)
Bless you.

[Speaker 1] (2:41:53 - 2:42:05)
Common address, 7100 through 7110 North Sheridan Road. Change request, B3-1 Community Shopping District to a B2-3 Neighborhood Mixed Use District. Counselor?

Bridget?

[Speaker 31] (2:42:06 - 2:43:27)
Bridget O'Keefe, Daspen & Almond, 300 South Wacker, Suite 2200, Chicago 60606. I represent Maynard 7100, Sheridan LLC, the owner of the property at hand. I'm accompanied by Wiley Carr, who is a property manager with CLK and represents the owner of the property.

The property is located at the northwest corner of Sheridan and Estes. In the 49th Ward, it's a traditional courtyard building with active retail at grade and 58 rental units above. It was built in 1927, and it's legally nonconforming.

There is currently active retail on the Sheridan frontage. However, there's two retail units along Estes, which were recently vacated, and the owner has been unable to lease the space. Estes is primarily a residential street, and it's just been more of a challenge.

The Type 1 rezoning to the B2-3 designation is sought to allow the conversion of the two retail units to two residential units on the first floor and to obtain approval of TOD designation to allow relief from parking for two spaces. The property is located immediately adjacent to bus route number 147, an eligible bus route. There will be no changes to the exterior of the building.

It's simply interior renovations. We met with the Alderman Haddon's office. She went through a community process, and we have received a letter of support for the project, which has been made part of the record.

[Speaker 1] (2:43:28 - 2:43:49)
Bridget, we did receive that letter from Alderman Haddon, and she's not feeling well today, but obviously you have her support. Any questions from committee members? Hearing none, Alderman Brendan Riley moves to pass.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

The ayes have it, and the item is passed.

[Speaker 31] (2:43:49 - 2:43:50)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (2:43:50 - 2:45:28)
Happy holidays. Thank you for your patience. Okay.

So we have, okay, so we have a, we're going to go to top of page 13, and this is document number 20152 in the first ward. Ordinance was referred on September 18th of this year, address 1420 North Milwaukee. At the request of Alderman LaSpada, he moves, he was asked to defer this item.

Can I have a motion to defer? So moved. Alderman Cary Austin moves to defer.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

The ayes have it. Item is deferred. We have one more deferral.

We're back to MMS. What page? It's not, where is it? Give me page nine.

Okay. All right, page nine. Thank you, Cary.

Middle of page nine, document number 20240, 37th ward. Ordinance was referred on November 13th of this year. We did get in touch with Alderman Emma Mitz, and she has asked this item to be deferred.

There's still more community process involved with this, and at her request she's asking us to defer, so I would ask Alderman Cary Austin to move to defer on this item.

[Speaker 21] (2:45:29 - 2:45:29)
So moved.

[Speaker 1] (2:45:29 - 2:46:25)
Alderman Cary Austin moves to defer. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? The ayes have it, and this item is deferred. All right.

Now we're on the deferred agenda. Let's see where we're at. Planning Commission.

Which one? We're ready? Okay.

Middle of page 13, document number 20177, 2nd ward. Ordinance referred on September 18th of this year. Common address 213 West Schiller.

Change request. Residential plan, business plan development number 301 to residential business plan development number 301 as amended. Counselor?

[Speaker 3] (2:46:25 - 2:47:15)
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon again, for the record.

My name is Sarah Barnes, and I'm an attorney with the Losses and Sam Banks, located at 221 Northwest South Street. I'm happy to be here this afternoon on behalf of the applicant. The Catherine Cook School.

Here with me today on behalf of the school is Justin Pike, the Director of Facilities. Before I begin, Mr. Chairman, I would like to note for the record that we presented this matter to the Chicago Plan Commission at their public hearing held on November 21st, 2019, where we did receive unanimous support for the proposed amendment. With that in mind, I would ask respectfully that the report of proceedings from the Chicago Plan Commission please be adopted into the record here today.

[Speaker 1] (2:47:16 - 2:47:26)
Alderman Brendan Riley moves to incorporate the records from the Plan Commission. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? You guys have it. Records are incorporated.

Continue.

[Speaker 3] (2:47:27 - 2:49:45)
Thank you so much. The subject property is currently improved with a three-story commercial building, which is one of a series of multi-story, multi-unit buildings in a mixed-use development commonly known as Cobbler Square, which is located in the Old Town neighborhood. Cobbler Square makes up Plan Development Number 301, which was originally established in 1983.

Unfortunately, at that time, a school use was not contemplated by the original owners of the plan development, and it was therefore not prescribed under the PD uses. As a result, a school use would require a special use under the underlying zoning of the plan development, and that is exactly the use that we are attempting to establish within the PD here today. As a result, we've worked with the Department of Planning and Development, and it was determined that an amendment, an actual amendment to the plan development, would be required in order to permit three auxiliary classrooms to be located in the subject three-story building, which again is already existing within the PD.

Those auxiliary classrooms will be utilized by the Catherine Cook School, which is located just kitty corner to the subject site. Towards this end, there is no physical expansion of the existing buildings or any other buildings within the PD. The amendment that is before you here today is solely to allow for a school use to be established within the plan development, and that school use will be limited to the three auxiliary classrooms that are going to be located at the grade level of the existing building.

With this in mind, we have worked with Alderman Hopkins as well as presented the proposal to the Old Town Merchants and Residents Association, both of which are in support of the proposal. With that in mind, we just respectfully request your approval here today. Alderman Hopkins still is here.

He may have some...

[Speaker 1] (2:49:45 - 2:49:49)
Alderman Hopkins is here, and I'd ask him to speak on this item. Alderman?

[Speaker 18] (2:49:50 - 2:51:30)
Thank you, Chairman Tunney. The space in question in Cobbler Square, which is a very successful development in its own right and continues to be, but this particular space has been vacant for a number of years. It was the home to one of the original Pier 1 imports in Chicago, and they were successful for quite a while.

However, in recognition of the changing retail environments, they closed their doors, and the owner was unable to lease the space to another retail use, despite the fact that it clearly lends itself on a corner location in a very prominent location to retail use. The local business association of record originally contacted me lamenting the fact that it seemed to be languishing and there was no obvious retail tenant to replace it. I joined them in expressing some disappointment about that, but we both quickly realized that in today's marketplace, it's much better to have the lights on in an institutional use than to wait for a retail tenant that may never appear in just recognition of the changing environment.

So we are in full support of this. Also helping make that cause and getting the business association to support a non-retail use of a former retail space is the fact that the Catherine Cook School is highly regarded in the Old Town community. They've been a great partner, an outstanding educational institution that's a valued member of the community, and I'm sure my colleague from the 27th Ward would agree with me on that.

So when it was made public that they were the tenant seeking additional classroom expansion space, there was near unanimous support from the Old Town community. So I would urge an aye vote on this matter. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:51:30 - 2:51:56)
Thank you, Alderman. Questions from committee members? Move to pass.

Alderman Burnett moves to pass as revised. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Opinion Chair, the ayes have it. Item is passed as revised.

Just a quick note. Was this prior to Cobblestone? Was that the Shoal Foot Factory?

What was the use before then? Because that was a major, I mean, that was a huge...

[Speaker 18] (2:51:56 - 2:51:58)
Yes, there was a shoe factory on that location.

[Speaker 1] (2:51:58 - 2:52:08)
That was Shoal... Yeah. Mr. Moore, you should know that. You've been around a long time over there. All right. It's a famous, famous foot company, actually.

I'm going to tell you that.

[Speaker 38] (2:52:08 - 2:52:08)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:52:09 - 2:52:35)
All right, let's move on. All right, bottom of page 13, document number 19797, 4th Ward, ordinance referred on September 20th of 18. Common address, 700 through 712 East 41st Street, and the change request, C12 Neighborhood Commercial District to an RM5 residential multi-unit district.

[Speaker 15] (2:52:36 - 2:52:37)
Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:52:37 - 2:52:37)
Good afternoon, Mark.

[Speaker 15] (2:52:38 - 2:52:40)
Thank you. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, my name is Mark.

[Speaker 1] (2:52:40 - 2:52:41)
Do you remember the Shoal Foot Factory?

[Speaker 15] (2:52:41 - 2:52:46)
I do, I do, yes. I remember Well Street back in the old days.

[Speaker 1] (2:52:47 - 2:52:48)
Well, let's not go that way.

[Speaker 15] (2:52:50 - 2:53:52)
All right. All right. Members of the committee, my name is Mark Kupiak.

I'm an attorney, 77 West Washington. I represent the applicant. On behalf of the applicant, I have Kevin Keeney sitting beside me.

On this particular case, we've got the property located at the corner of 41st and Langley, presently a vacant lot. It's actually a vacant lot surrounded by a variety of residential uses. The current zoning, the C1 zoning, would require commercial on the ground floor.

The applicant has no desire to do commercial on the ground floor, doesn't think it fits at this location. So we asked to rezone it to a residential district to allow him to do a townhouse project, and the project would call for seven townhomes, which would be more compatible with all the surrounding residential uses. Kevin and his brother have met with the alderman several, several times to discuss the project over a period of time, and she has voiced her support and I believe sent a letter of support, if I'm correct.

[Speaker 1] (2:53:52 - 2:53:54)
We have a letter of support from Alderman Keeney.

[Speaker 15] (2:53:54 - 2:53:55)
And we'd ask for your recommendation.

[Speaker 1] (2:53:57 - 2:54:01)
Questions from committee members. Alderman Kerry Austin.

[Speaker 21] (2:54:01 - 2:54:08)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. To the applicant, what gave you a desire to build on this site?

[Speaker 15] (2:54:09 - 2:54:12)
Kevin, would you speak into the microphone and see if it's live?

[Speaker 38] (2:54:12 - 2:54:13)
Your name and address.

[Speaker 30] (2:54:15 - 2:54:28)
Kevin Kenny, Evergreen Park. We work in the area. That's why we see this vacant lot.

So there's some potential. So that's why we picked this site.

[Speaker 21] (2:54:30 - 2:54:31)
You work in the area?

[Speaker 30] (2:54:31 - 2:54:33)
We build other homes.

[Speaker 21] (2:54:35 - 2:54:39)
So you saw this site and said that, you know, I would like to build some townhouses.

[Speaker 30] (2:54:39 - 2:54:40)
Yes.

[Speaker 21] (2:54:41 - 2:54:44)
Okay. In your work, what kind of work do you do?

[Speaker 30] (2:54:45 - 2:54:48)
We build some homes and we also do work, carpentry contractors also.

[Speaker 38] (2:54:49 - 2:54:49)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:54:52 - 2:55:03)
Other questions? So maybe for the department on this one, I know about, is there any affordability required, this, or are they paying into a fund, or is it neither?

[Speaker 5] (2:55:04 - 2:55:09)
Patrick Murphy, Department of Planning. If it's only seven units, it wouldn't trigger the ARO ordinance.

[Speaker 1] (2:55:09 - 2:55:27)
Okay. So it has to be 10. Yes, sir.

Okay. Other questions? Can I get a motion move to pass on the item?

Alderman Kappelman moves to pass on this item. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed?

[Speaker 38] (2:55:27 - 2:55:27)
No.

[Speaker 1] (2:55:28 - 2:56:36)
We have Kerry Austin, no. All right. So the item is passed with the objection of Kerry Austin.

All right. Thank you. Next, we are, are we on page 14?

Okay. Top of page 14, document number 20197, 13th Ward, ordinance referred on September 18th of 19, common address 5401 through 5459 West 64th Place, 6435 through 6459 South Linder Avenue, 5400 through 5458 West 65th Street, and 6434 through 6458 South Long Avenue. Change request RS2, residential single unit detached house district to an RT4, residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district, and then to the institutional plan development.

Good afternoon, Carol. Thank you for your patience today.

[Speaker 20] (2:56:36 - 2:57:09)
Absolutely. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.

Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, for the record, Carol Stubblefield with the law firm of Neal and Leroy, offices located at 20 South Clark here on behalf of the Applicant Public Building Commission. With me today are representatives from the PBC, CPS, and our architect of record. This matter was heard and unanimously approved at the November 21st, 2019 Chicago Plan Commission.

We would ask that the findings, the conclusions of the Chicago Plan Commission, all documents given to the Department of Planning and Development be adopted and keep today's record.

[Speaker 1] (2:57:09 - 2:57:19)
Alderman Walter Burnett moves to incorporate the records from the Plan Commission. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Hearing none, the ayes have it and records are now incorporated.

[Speaker 20] (2:57:19 - 2:58:59)
Thank you. This matter requests approval to amend the current RS2 zoning lot to an RT4 and then to an institutional plan development. This is a mandatory plan development pursuant to Section 17-80506, which requires PD review and approval for the development of land to be used for schools on sites with net site area of two acres or more.

This property is approximately 3.65 acres. It's a vacant site located in the clearing community area and located directly south of Midway International Airport. PBC proposes to construct a new building for the John Hancock High School.

The building will not exceed 49 feet 8 inches in height and will contain approximately 180,000 square feet and will accommodate approximately 1,080 students with 103 full-time employees and provide 47 accessory vehicular parking spaces. The project will seek a LEED Silver certification. The construction budget is approximately $84.9 million and will achieve approximately 279 construction jobs and 103 permanent jobs. The goal is to start construction in the end of this year and be completed by the third quarter of 2021. The PBC is committed to achieving goals of 26 MBE precipitation and 6 WBE and a local hiring of 50%. This project has the full support of Alderman Quinn and I believe there are copies of the letter of support in the file.

That concludes our presentation. We'd be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 21] (2:59:02 - 2:59:03)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (2:59:04 - 2:59:15)
Alderman, before we, Carol, I know it did pass plan commission, I was there, but we do not have an active letter. I know he supported it then, but do you have a copy of the letter?

[Speaker 20] (2:59:16 - 2:59:17)
I will look in my file.

[Speaker 1] (2:59:17 - 2:59:22)
I believe we did have copies of the letters. Submit it, get it to us, please. All right.

Alderman Cary Austin.

[Speaker 20] (2:59:22 - 2:59:23)
Is this a replacement?

[Speaker 1] (2:59:26 - 2:59:40)
Who would like to? Wait, wait. Are we into one of them?

Hello? Yeah. Okay.

Great.

[Speaker 14] (2:59:41 - 2:59:43)
Brian Zader with CPS. This is a replacement school.

[Speaker 1] (2:59:47 - 3:00:09)
All right. Other questions? The only question that came up during plan commission was location was one and it's near the, obviously it's near the airport.

There was questions about sound mitigation and of course the flights going over midway and such, but can you respond to that kind of quickly on that one? This is Lauren Johnson with Legate Architects.

[Speaker 14] (3:00:09 - 3:00:21)
Yes, we engaged an acoustician to analyze the sound present on the site, and we followed the recommendations to increase the acoustic resistance of the exterior envelope, including walls, glazing, and roof.

[Speaker 1] (3:00:24 - 3:01:52)
And I'm sorry, this is a high school? And the enrollment potential? The enrollment potential will be 1,080 students.

Okay. And as Carol said, project cost? Close to $90 million.

Public education doesn't come cheap. Let's put it that way. All right.

Any other questions? Okay. Alderman Cary Austin moves to pass as revised.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

Hearing none, this item is passed as revised. Good luck and congratulations to Alderman McQueen. Yes.

$90 million. You'll send it to? Yeah.

Okay. Great. We do know it passed unanimously, if I believe.

All right. Thank you. And now we're into middle of page 14, number 20232, 18th Ward, ordinance referred on October 16th of this year, 19, common address, 4000 West 87th Street.

Change request, B31 community shopping district to a C21 motor vehicle related commercial district. The famous, if I'm not mistaken, 87th and Southwest Highway. It's auto-centric.

I guarantee you it's auto-centric.

[Speaker 29] (3:01:52 - 3:01:56)
It certainly is. I actually grew up in Marquette Park and we used to pass by it all the time.

[Speaker 1] (3:01:56 - 3:01:59)
It's the longest stoplight in the city of Chicago, I think.

[Speaker 38] (3:02:00 - 3:02:02)
Correct. All right.

[Speaker 29] (3:02:02 - 3:02:31)
Good morning. I'm Sanaa Hussein on behalf of the applicants, and I have here with me Mr. Ayub Swice, the owner of the auto repair shop, K&Z Auto Repair. And I also have the landlord here, Mr. Tom Jennings, who is officer and director of Tom's Cabinet, Inc., the entity that owns the property. So we also have a letter of support from the alderman, and it is part of the record. And I have a copy if you don't have it.

[Speaker 1] (3:02:32 - 3:02:33)
Okay. Proceed.

[Speaker 29] (3:02:42 - 3:03:26)
This property, as you know, is known as the Triangle on Southwest Highway, 87th Street and Pulaski Avenue. And it's been offered as an auto repair shop for the past two years by Mr. Swice. And he would like to add to auto repair to be able to sell the autos that he's repairing if those owners so choose.

And we've discussed this with the alderman. He's in support of this amendment. And we've sent correspondence to all of the neighbors.

We've had no responses, no objections received from them. And we feel that this would be able to expand the type of business license that he has. And so we would apply for new licenses, of course, if you were to so approve of the amendment.

[Speaker 1] (3:03:28 - 3:03:31)
All right. Questions from committee members?

[Speaker 21] (3:03:31 - 3:03:32)
Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (3:03:32 - 3:03:34)
Alderman Cary Austin.

[Speaker 21] (3:03:35 - 3:03:39)
The Tom's Cabinet. Are you still making cabinets? Yes.

[Speaker 30] (3:03:43 - 3:03:44)
Yes, in the basement.

[Speaker 38] (3:03:45 - 3:03:50)
I have a set. Yes, I have a set in the basement.

[Speaker 1] (3:03:51 - 3:03:55)
Okay. And you are Mr. Tom Cabinet? Is that your name?

[Speaker 21] (3:03:56 - 3:04:05)
Tom's it. Yeah. But I do have a, would you think that it's going to be on that triangle?

Where would the vehicle?

[Speaker 29] (3:04:06 - 3:04:19)
There are actually parking spots there and they're being used right now for to park the cars that are being repaired. And so he would, he would just be able to store them there. I believe you have about 20 spaces.

[Speaker 21] (3:04:24 - 3:04:25)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:04:26 - 3:04:27)
Other questions.

[Speaker 21] (3:04:31 - 3:04:31)
No.

[Speaker 1] (3:04:32 - 3:04:47)
All right. All right. So all the men carry Austin moves to pass on this item.

All those in favor. Aye. Aye.

Any opposed. Then you share the ayes have it. And this item is passed.

So thank you. Luck to you.

[Speaker 29] (3:04:47 - 3:04:47)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:04:48 - 3:05:24)
So the old way they used to have the cabinets inside the car. You could really dial up the cabinet inside the car. I'm really old and I carry.

All right. Let's go to the bottom of page 14. Number 2 0 1 6 8 21st ward ordinance referred on September 18th of this year.

Common address. 1000 West 94th street. Change request.

M 1 1 limited manufacturing business park district to a M 2 1 light industry district. Mr. Tom Moore.

[Speaker 6] (3:05:24 - 3:06:56)
Thank you. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name for the record is Thomas S Moore.

And with me today is Gregory summer. Mr. Summer is the owner of the applicant LLC. And for many years, he's run a landscape business.

He does work all over the city. He moved his business from a suburban location to this location on the south side, which was an abandoned old. Property been vacant for many years.

The landlord and others assured him that he could run his landscape business there. But when he went to license it, he found that since he has his landscape trailers and trucks that are in the open contractor's yard that he needed an M 2 instead of an M 1. We went to Alderman Brookins.

Incidentally, he employs many dozen of people in this business. And we went to see Alderman Brookins who held a community meeting. At the community meeting, there were some concerns like that.

Some of his employees park in front of people's houses and things. Mr. Summer immediately addressed all of those concerns. He found parking someplace else.

And we sent Alderman Brookins a draft plan of operation to address all of the neighbors concerns. And following that, I believe Alderman Brookins had a conversation with the chairman and has no objection. And we'd ask for your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (3:06:58 - 3:07:14)
For the record, I did have a conversation with Alderman Brookins. And he has no objection to this ordinance. Questions from committee members?

What's the name of the landscaping company?

[Speaker 30] (3:07:17 - 3:07:20)
The company is Summer Landscape LLC.

[Speaker 1] (3:07:20 - 3:07:38)
Oh, that sounds like your name. Great. All right.

Other questions? No other questions. Alderman Kappelman moves to pass on this item.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

The chair of the ayes have it.

[Speaker 6] (3:07:38 - 3:07:39)
Thank you very much. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (3:07:39 - 3:08:24)
And do not be parking in front of residents there. We don't want to see you back there. Alderman Brookins will do a down zoning, I think.

All right. Let's see about top of page 15. Number 19984, 27th Ward, ordinance referred on March 13th of this year, 19, common address 1200-1234 West Randolph Street, and 146-162 North Racine.

Change request. C13 Neighborhood Commercial District to a DX5 downtown mixed-use development and then to a business plan development. Michael, good afternoon.

[Speaker 27] (3:08:24 - 3:09:00)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. Michael Esger on behalf of the applicant, 1234 West Randolph Developer, LLC. Here with me today is Paul Dinson, who is project manager with the applicant, as well as Amber Heitromoff from Noor Architecture and Michael Werthmann from KLOA Traffic Consultants.

This is the team that went to plan commission together on November 21st, where we were approved for this matter, and I would respectfully request that the record of that proceeding be incorporated here.

[Speaker 1] (3:09:02 - 3:09:10)
Alderman Cary Austin moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Ayes have it. Records are incorporated.

[Speaker 27] (3:09:10 - 3:10:21)
We started this project at the beginning of this year and have gone through an extensive community process under Alderman Burnett's direction, having visited with three of the community groups and having a large community meeting with a lot of follow-up after each of these. The proposal was originally for a 23-story hotel. During the process, the hotel was reduced in height to a 16-story building.

There's a complete redesign and some thoughtful additions, working closely with the planning department to comply with the West Loop design guidelines. We also spent quite a bit of time working with KLOA, with City Winery, and with our standard hotel, which is the operator for this hotel, to improve and to come up with a really good traffic plan that was eventually supported by the community. We have support from the West Central Association as well as the West Loop Community Organization for the project.

With that, I will defer to Alderman Burnett, who is here, and we're here to answer any questions.

[Speaker 4] (3:10:23 - 3:11:10)
Alderman Burnett. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. The Council pretty much said everything.

We had him to go before three of the local community organizations. The majority of them supported the project. We had a large community meeting.

There were some questions not only by the residents and the community, but also by the Department of Transportation about the drop-off and pick-up and the traffic. They worked with Transportation to come up with a resolution. So with that, I support this project.

Also, I'm encouraged that they will be having a contractor to joint venture with an African-American contractor, and we appreciate that.

[Speaker 1] (3:11:10 - 3:11:41)
Thank you, Alderman. Questions for the Alderman or the applicant? Well, hell, good afternoon.

All right, Alderman Moore moves to pass as revised. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Then you chair the ayes have it, and congratulations. I think I was on this, and I think our new planning commissioner really spoke out very favorably about this architecture.

[Speaker 4] (3:11:42 - 3:11:54)
Was it this one? Yes, I think he had experience with this architecture, architect in New York, I guess, or somewhere else, Detroit. I don't know.

Well, congrats. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:11:54 - 3:12:24)
Great, OK, bottom, middle, bottom of page 15, document number 20066, 27th Ward, ordinance referred on June 12th of this year, 19, common address, 1436 through 1450, West Randolph Street, and the change request, C-13, neighborhood commercial district to a C-15, and then to a residential business plan development. Good afternoon. Sarah?

[Speaker 3] (3:12:24 - 3:13:18)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, again, and members of the committee once more for the record. My name is Sarah Barnes, and I'm an attorney with the Lofts of Sandbanks. Happy to be here this afternoon on behalf of the applicant, MP Union Park, LLC.

Here with me today from that LLC and our project manager is Gabrielle Gambino-Leon. Before I begin, Mr. Chairman, I would like to note as well for the record that we did present this matter to the Chicago Plan Commission at their public hearing, which was held on November 21st, 2019, wherein we did receive unanimous support for the proposal that is here before you today. And with that in mind, I would ask that the committee please adopt the report of proceedings from the Chicago Plan Commission into the proceedings here today.

[Speaker 1] (3:13:19 - 3:13:27)
Alderman Cary Austin moves to incorporate the records from the Plan Commission. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? The chair of the ayes have it, and the records are incorporated.

[Speaker 3] (3:13:27 - 3:17:32)
Thank you so much. Similar to the previous proposal, we too engaged in a pretty lengthy community review process for the proposal that you have before you here today. It's gone through several different iterations.

With that in mind, and with the backing of Alderman Burnett, we met with the West Loop Community Organization, the West Chamber Association, the neighbors of West Loop, as well as the Union Park Advisory Board and operators of the Pitchfork Music Festival, which is held at Union Park, which is the park that is immediately across the street from the subject property. Through all of those meetings and communications and different iterations, we arrived at the proposal that you do have before you here today, and I apologize there's no renderings up there. I will give a description of the proposal in just a moment.

But we're happy to report back that we did have pretty good support for the proposal. With that in mind, the site is generally located on the northwest corner of Randolph and Ogden, again, across the street from Union Park. It's presently improved with a five-story office building on the corner, as well as a two-story industrial building.

The proposal calls for the rehabilitation and renovation of that five-story office building. All of the tenants that are currently within the building will remain in the building, but will get renovated spaces, as well as new parking. The proposal further calls for the demolition of the existing two-story industrial building, and in its place, the construction of a new 10-story mixed-use building, which will contain a small retail and commercial space at the hard corner, as well as residential amenity space and a lobby at grade level.

On floors 2 through 10, you will find a total of 243 dwelling units, as well as on-site parking, interior parking for 87 vehicles, which will be accessed off of the alley. That was one of the modifications that was made throughout the community process, so to limit and restrict any traffic on Randolph Street. Everything will go from Lake Street into the alley.

Towards this end, and in consideration of the proposal, the site is located in the near-north pilot area with regards to the Affordable Requirements Ordinance. As such, the project did have a 20% ARO requirement, which is a total of 49 dwelling units. 25 of those dwelling units, of the affordable units, are going to be located on-site in the new 10-story building and will be reflective of the overall unit mix and size within the market rate building.

The other 25 affordable units are going to be located off-site within two miles of the subject property in a newly rehabbed building. As well, and towards these same ends, the applicant is going to meet the goals of the MBEWE Enterprise Program and will also be engaging in local hiring within the 27th Ward. He will commit to work with the Alderman's Office towards having job fairs and hiring of subcontractors within the Ward.

As well, the general contractor for the project will also be working towards those ends. With that, we had a community meeting as well that I'm sure Alderman Burnett could speak further to and we also just respectfully request the support of the committee here today for the proposal.

[Speaker 4] (3:17:35 - 3:18:59)
Alderman Burnett. Thank you very much, Ms. Chairman. As the Councillor said, this has gone through several renditions with some of the guidance from the Department of Planning.

They did meet with several community organizations. In particular, the Park District was concerned about being right next to the park and encroaching on the events that they have at the park. They made a lot of changes.

We encouraged them to do the affordable housing on-site and they're going to do affordable housing off-site, not too far from this building right down Ogden Street. So it's right in the neighborhood. So we have affordable housing in the new building and affordable housing in the building that needs to be rehabbed.

They also committed to having a joint venture with a minority contractor with their contractor and hire people from the neighborhood and also they on their own supported the Park District to, matter of fact, do programs with the park, right, which is a great thing. So this has been a win-win for the community. We ask the committee for their support.

Majority of the people in the neighborhood support it. I don't have anyone that has told me that they were against it, so we ask for your support.

[Speaker 1] (3:18:59 - 3:19:08)
Thank you, Alderman. Questions for the Alderman or the applicant? I have just one quick question.

Could you confirm the amount of parking?

[Speaker 3] (3:19:09 - 3:19:09)
87.

[Speaker 1] (3:19:11 - 3:19:16)
So that's a little different than what I'm, is that I'm seeing? Is it, what's the 59?

[Speaker 3] (3:19:16 - 3:19:33)
Yeah, so probably, are you looking at the agenda, Alderman? Yeah, so for whatever reason, they always put on the agenda the narrative from the original application. As we indicated, it's changed several times since that.

So it's 80? Yep, 87.

[Speaker 1] (3:19:33 - 3:19:37)
Okay, and then the existing office building, that has no parking?

[Speaker 3] (3:19:39 - 3:19:54)
It does not have parking right now, but we are going to be providing some of the 87 parking spaces towards the office users. Okay, that's it. This is a transit service location, so.

[Speaker 1] (3:19:54 - 3:19:55)
That was in the narrative.

[Speaker 3] (3:19:56 - 3:19:56)
Yeah.

[Speaker 1] (3:19:56 - 3:19:58)
I just saw the different numbers and I just.

[Speaker 3] (3:19:58 - 3:20:01)
Yeah, no, I know the agendas. Great, okay, other questions?

[Speaker 4] (3:20:02 - 3:20:08)
Actually, Mr. Chairman, it's actually across, it's actually five steps away from the L stop.

[Speaker 3] (3:20:09 - 3:20:09)
Yeah.

[Speaker 1] (3:20:11 - 3:20:13)
Congratulations, Alderman. Do I have a motion?

[Speaker 21] (3:20:14 - 3:20:16)
No objections, so moved.

[Speaker 1] (3:20:16 - 3:20:54)
Alderman Kerry, Austin, moves do pass as revised. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Then you Chair, the ayes have it. Thank you.

Congratulations. All right, on to page 16. Top of page.

Number 19804, T1. In the 32nd Ward, ordinance referred on September 20th of 18. Common address 2341 through 47 North Elston.

Change request M33, heavy industry district to a B22 neighborhood mixed-use district.

[Speaker 3] (3:20:57 - 3:22:21)
Thank you. One last time for the record, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Sarah Barnes and I'm an attorney with the Lofts of Sandbanks located at 221 North LaSalle Street.

A couple items of housekeeping before I begin. Mr. Chairman, well, first let me introduce the applicant who is here with me today on behalf of 2343 through 47 North Elston Avenue. We have with us Russ Ustanich.

We also have someone here with us on behalf of the project architects, Mr. Fred Corio. Oh, I cannot say that as well, but thank you. From Red Architects and they are the project architects for this proposal.

So again, before I begin, two kind of matters of housekeeping. One, prior to this hearing, but subsequent to the filing of the application, we did tender to the, we made some revisions to the proposal based on community review. As a result, we not only have a substitute ordinance, but we also have substitute narrative and plans that were tendered to the Department of Planning and Development actually about a month ago now, but prior to this hearing.

So I do ask that the substitute ordinance as well as the substitute narrative and plans be adopted here and incorporated into the record here today.

[Speaker 1] (3:22:22 - 3:22:42)
We've got a couple of asks, but before we ask, I just want to look at the application. So we're looking at zoning from 2341 through 47. But the owners own only 2343 to 47.

What's going on with that?

[Speaker 3] (3:22:42 - 3:22:52)
No, they own all of it. Are you referring to the LLC's name? Yeah, no, it's just for whatever reason, their attorney, their transaction.

[Speaker 1] (3:22:52 - 3:22:56)
So we're looking at zoning all the way from 41 through 47.

[Speaker 3] (3:22:56 - 3:23:02)
The appropriate address, which does appear on the ordinance is 2341 through 2347.

[Speaker 1] (3:23:02 - 3:23:03)
Okay.

[Speaker 3] (3:23:03 - 3:23:11)
And it's North Elston Court, and that is one of the corrections that was actually made with regard to the substitute ordinance.

[Speaker 1] (3:23:12 - 3:23:49)
All right. So first, Alderman Burnett. Nope.

Alderman Cary Austin moves to accept the substitute ordinance. All those in favor, aye. Aye.

Any opposed? The ayes have it. The substitute is accepted.

And now, what's the next one? Now, Alderman Kappelman moves to accept the substantive narrative and plans for the type one application. All those in favor, aye.

Any opposed? Ayes have it. And the substantive narrative and plans are accepted.

Can we proceed?

[Speaker 3] (3:23:50 - 3:24:32)
Absolutely. So with regard to the address change, part of that was because the subject property is located in the North Branch Industrial Corridor. As a result, we did have to go through review with the Department of Planning and Development, as well as the Chicago Plan Commission to ensure that they proposed a use is consistent and compatible with the other uses that are located within that industrial corridor.

As such, on October 17th, 2019, we did present this matter to the Chicago Plan Commission at their public hearing. So I would, again, ask that the report of those proceedings please be adopted into the record here today.

[Speaker 1] (3:24:33 - 3:24:42)
So Alderman Kariostan moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Ayes have it. Records are incorporated.

[Speaker 3] (3:24:42 - 3:25:24)
And one last housekeeping matter. As you referenced, Mr. Chairman, this application was originally introduced back in 2018, September of 2018. In fact, we had very, very lengthy community review process.

And as a result, we did not go to Chicago or we did not appear at the plan commission until October. And then before this board until now, as such, we did have to republish the notice, but that was done through your office at the direction of the Department of Planning and Development. So I just would like to confirm for the record that that was established before we appeared here today.

[Speaker 1] (3:25:25 - 3:25:27)
And yes, that has been renoted. Thank you.

[Speaker 3] (3:25:28 - 3:26:53)
With that in mind, the proposal calls for the construction of a new four story with basement, all residential building at the subject site. The proposed new building will contain a total of nine dwelling units located between the basement and fourth, fourth floors, as well as an attached one story garage that will provide one-to-one parking for each of the units for a total of nine parking spaces. That parking will be accessed off of the public alley.

As I indicated, we met with Alderman Wagesack over a year ago to begin the process. He then directed us to meet with the Bucktown community organization, which is the neighborhood group that has jurisdiction over this proposal. We met with the Bucktown community organization over the course of 12 months, probably six to seven times.

The proposals changed numerous times to what it is here today. I think it ended up quite honestly as a much better project. So we are thankful for that time and deliberation that was given to us by both Alderman Wagesack and the community.

Alderman Wagesack is not here today, but he has tendered and has issued a letter of support for this proposal, which I have tendered a copy of to the committee.

[Speaker 38] (3:26:54 - 3:26:55)
We have received it.

[Speaker 3] (3:26:56 - 3:27:03)
With that in mind, we'd be happy to answer any questions. We also received the approval of the Chicago Plan Commission.

[Speaker 1] (3:27:04 - 3:27:27)
Questions from committee members? Hearing no objection, Alderman Kerry Austin moves to pass with substantive narrative and plans and amended and revised, almost foreclosed. All those in favor?

[Speaker 38] (3:27:28 - 3:27:28)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (3:27:28 - 3:27:31)
Any opposed? Then you chair the ayes have it.

[Speaker 3] (3:27:31 - 3:27:32)
Thank you so much.

[Speaker 1] (3:27:33 - 3:27:36)
And good luck to you. Hopefully you'll get this out of the ground.

[Speaker 3] (3:27:37 - 3:27:39)
I know. All right.

[Speaker 1] (3:27:40 - 3:28:03)

Alderman Kaplan moves to accept the substantive narrative plans for the type one application. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Ayes have it. Substantive narrative and plans are in front of us.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have a Mr. Sean McGuire here today. Mr. McGuire is the contract purchaser. The proposal is to change from RS3 to B 2 3 for construction of a three unit dwelling unit building to be sold as condos, three off street garage parking spaces. It's right in between similar zoning, exactly identical zoning. In fact, and it would replace a small frame multi-unit building that's past its useful life.

So we started this actually with the prior Alderman of the 33rd ward. And we met with Alderman Rodriguez Sanchez and her staff many times. And they, they didn't have their procedures set in place.

So once they did, I'm very happy to say we had a successful community meeting last week. And I have a letter of support from Alderman Rosanna Rodriguez Sanchez this morning, sir.

If approved, Mr. Papillo would take the existing vacant building and use it as a dance studio for visceral dance.

We have the reviewed the proposal with Alderman Rosanna Rodriguez Sanchez who has issued her support. I believe in the, in the form of a letter I have a copy of you. If the chair does not have one.

We have also reviewed this item with the Avondale neighborhood association, North branch works association and a variety of state city agencies, which have universally supported the proposal along with the plan commission on November 21st. Therefore we request this committee's recommendation of approval of the requested amendment to the full city council.

[Speaker 1] (3:33:32 - 3:33:55)
Questions, committee members. I, I have one question because I was at plan commission during this item and there was an, a concern about windows and I know it's a dance studio and such. obviously that's not part of the zoning, but did, are we, do we, do we make some accommodation?

I can't remember.

[Speaker 16] (3:33:55 - 3:34:08)
Well, I don't think we've incorporated anything yet, but, but the, um, we've also discovered in some subsequent that this is a manufacturing existing manufacturing building built lot line to lot line.

[Speaker 1] (3:34:08 - 3:34:16)
So windows could not be from the building department. Okay, great. Cause I knew that there was, it was quite a lively discussion on that one.

[Speaker 16] (3:34:16 - 3:34:19)

[Speaker 12] (3:35:20 - 3:36:12)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee on zoning. My name is Kate Duncan. I'm an attorney with Jack George at Akerman look with offices located at 71 South Wacker drive.

We are appearing today on behalf of the applicant global citizenship experience lab school in connection with application number two Oh one nine four present this morning is Kate Cabell King, head of the school and Monica Chata, our architect and owner of civic projects. The subject property is located at 51 to 65 East Randolph street and the zoned plan development number seven, 87 please note that this application was presented to and received the recommendation of the Chicago plan commission at its hearing held on November 21st, 2019. And we respectfully request that the report of proceedings before the plan commission, together with all reports and drawings previously transmitted to DPD, be incorporated into and made a part of this proceeding.

[Speaker 1] (3:36:13 - 3:36:22)
All the men carry Austin moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission. All those in favor. Aye.

Any opposed opinion chair, the eyes have it. And these records are incorporated.

[Speaker 12] (3:36:23 - 3:38:29)
The applicant is here today to request approval of a technical amendment to plan development. Number seven, 87. Applicant is proposing to occupy the third floor of the existing heritage building and to use this space as a high school.

When the building was constructed, the first, the third floor was intended for commercial uses, but it's never been occupied since the building was originally constructed 15 years ago. Plan development plan development number seven, 87 allows for mixed uses, including multifamily dwelling units, retail offices, accessory and non-accessory parking, but a school is not an allowed use in accordance with the terms. As a result, applicant is seeking this technical amendment to include a high school as a permitted use.

And the purpose of this amendment is solely to allow this high school to operate within the commercial space of the existing building. For the record, I'd like to note there are only 50 students that currently attend this high school. And right now it's located in Lincoln park.

These students come from all different neighborhoods throughout Chicago, primarily using public transportation. Currently there are 12 staff members. The school does anticipate some growth with the relocation, but enrollment will be a maximum of 170 students with a maximum one seven zero seven zero with a maximum staff of 25.

And that's over the course of the next 10 years, no drop-off or pickup of students will be allowed on either Garland court or Randolph street. And the school will have access to seven parking spaces within the building to accommodate those times when a parent or a visitor has to drive to the school. Please note that presently 43% of the staff bikes to work with the remainder taking public transportation and at a maximum two staff members driving to the current school location.

Applicant anticipates meeting the mayor's executive order and has goals of 26 and 6% for construction of it's filled out of the third floor. Applicant has met extensively with alderman Bradley regarding this project and has also met with the heritage heritage condominium association who expressed full support for the school. We believe that this technical amendment to the plan development meets the standards of the zoning code of the city of Chicago.

And on behalf of my client, I respectfully request your favorable recommendation and we're happy to answer any questions you may have.

[Speaker 1] (3:38:31 - 3:39:26)
Questions. We do. I was involved with this one.

As I said, it was a lively meeting and that whole drop off and pick up issue was a concern to some of the surrounding neighbors, but obviously as was, as was talked about today that, you know, 95, 98% of people use are using public transit and the fact of a diverse experience for these students downtown is, is pretty enlightening in of itself. So I enjoyed actually the conversation. So we have any questions from the committee members hearing none alderman Kappelman moves do pass as revised.

All those in favor. Aye. Any, any, any opposed.

Can you share the ayes have it.

[Speaker 12] (3:39:26 - 3:39:27)
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (3:39:28 - 3:39:52)

Any opposed. Didn't ensure the eyes have records are incorporated.

[Speaker 12] (3:41:00 - 3:41:49)
Applicants here today to request approval of a plan development for the subject property. The applicant is seeking to install a retractable structure to enclose the existing rooftop terrace at the Ivy hotel. The rezoning to a plan development is required since the additional enclosed area will exceed the permitted FAR for the building.

As a result, the applicant must use the neighborhood opportunity fund bonus to increase the overall FAR for the hotel from 15.1 to 15.9. An applicant will make a payment to the NOF for this bonus. FAR applicant has met with Alderman Riley regarding this project and has also met with the SOAR community group who provided a letter of support for this plan development. We believe that this plan development meets the standards of the zoning code of the city of Chicago.

And I respectfully request your favorable recommendation. We are happy to answer any questions you may have.

[Speaker 1] (3:41:51 - 3:42:03)

Since. So this is an opportunity to bring the building back to life.

[Speaker 1] (3:44:04 - 3:44:10)
I'm a little familiar with this site. So it's at the corner of Granville and. And Western.

And then there was a subsequent foreclosure. So I believe at that point. The alderman down zone, the property.
