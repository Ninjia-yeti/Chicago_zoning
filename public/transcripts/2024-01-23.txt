We'll now move to the approval of the Rule 45 report containing the minutes of the December hearing of the Committee on Zoning, Landmark, and Building Standards. All members of this committee should have a copy of this report in their packets. And if hearing no objections, do I have a motion by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum to approve the minutes?

Alderman Riley so moves. Any objections? Hearing none, no objections, the report is approved.

Moving on, I will now read the items to be deferred. I will read the page number, the file number, the address, and then take a motion for all at the end.

At this time, we'll begin the public comment period. The public comment period is limited to 30 minutes. Out of respect for everyone's time, each speaker is limited to three minutes.

We have just the one public speaker today, who we'll hear from now, Mr. George Blakemore.

[Speaker 11] (28:05 - 28:43)
Something's wrong here. You have one public speaker in your zoning committee. Perhaps people are looking online.

I went to Ms. Valencia, and I said, what about your website? Are you making it friendly? We, the citizens of the city.

Do you want to hear me? Walter Burnett, could you be seated, please? Chairman, will you tell him to be seated?

He's distracting me. Sit down. Once the public comes.

[Speaker 1] (28:43 - 28:46)
Mr. Blakemore, please address your comments to the chair.

[Speaker 11] (28:46 - 29:08)
I can't hear, I can't, because he's distracting me. Just the presence of the chairman is annoying me. Just the presence that a citizen comes to a meeting, and the people that sit on this body, supposed to be representing the people.

[Speaker 24] (29:09 - 29:13)
And for somebody to turn around and talk to somebody else?

[Speaker 11] (29:13 - 30:07)
You are a public servant. You work for the public. The public don't work for you.

So I'm addressing to all of y'all, and I expect each one of y'all will give me dignity and respect. So you don't have a side show when they say the public should sit and bend over and turn your back to the public. The one who's paying you, you're supposed to be a public servant.

We don't serve you. Anyway, let me get back to this point. The waste, and the fraud, and the abuse of people's behavior.

They come here for ultimate, and they leave rich. Because what's going on in these various committees? You see how arrogant he is?

And they are? I'm not only addressing that to you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 24] (30:10 - 30:19)
What's wrong with you? And I expect you to do everything for me to follow. I'm giving you a reason to follow.

[Speaker 11] (30:48 - 30:54)
Who do you think you are to throw with me? Where's the Chairman? Why don't you take that chairmanship away from Rosa?

[Speaker 24] (30:55 - 31:07)
Zero tolerance for people that fight you, threaten you. Zero tolerance. That's what we want for Rosa, what we want for you.

And why don't you start Rosa's case?

[Speaker 1] (31:08 - 31:45)
Thank you, Mr. Blakemore. I have no other public comments. We'll move on to the agenda.

The first item up today is the mayoral introduction of document number 02023-0006384, the amendment of municipal code titles 4, 11, and 14 to make technical corrections and adjustment to the Chicago construction codes. All committee members should have received a copy electronically and will find the ordinance as well as a brief summary in the packet before them. We have Building Commissioner Matt Bode here to present on the matter.

Commissioner?

[Speaker 3] (31:46 - 33:51)
Good morning, Vice Chairman Lawson and members of the Committee on Zoning, Landmarks, and Building Standards. My name is Matt Bode. I'm the Commissioner for the Department of Buildings.

With me today is Managing Deputy Commissioner Grant Ulrich, and also with us is our valued partners from Local 130 Plumbers, Mr. Jim Majerowicz and Mr. John D'Amico. Here today to ask for your favor, consideration for Mayor Johnson's technical corrections and modification amendments to the various chapters of the Chicago Construction Codes. I believe you received a copy of the substitute for 6382 and a summary of the sections for both ordinances.

As you recall, the City Council approved the first major rewrite of the Chicago Building Code in 70 years, and that modernized code went into full effect on August 1, 2020. As promised at that time, DOB continues to work with all stakeholders and have come before this Council when we have identified a need to clarify or enhance the new codes. The amendment package before you for your consideration reflects those ongoing efforts.

I'm grateful to our partners in the skilled trade for these amendments, as well as our fellow City Departments in this round, Aviation, Fire, Planning, Development, and Transportation for their input in making the codes better and more user-friendly. To provide a few highlights, the proposed amendments extends the effective date of changes to drain layer license to accommodate the City's ongoing IT modification efforts, clarifies provisions related to requirements for general contractors, mason contractors, and crane operator licensees, clarifies exceptions to requirements to obtain a building permit for certain non-building structures and work subject to the jurisdiction of CDOT, simplifies requirements for fire separations for certain assembly occupancies and fully sprinkled buildings, adjusts occupancy load calculating for casino gaming floors, allows delayed egress locking in secured areas and airport terminals, clarifies requirements for fire services, access elevators, and high-rise buildings. Thank you for your time, and I ask for your favor of consideration for these amendments, and we are happy to answer any questions you may have.

[Speaker 1] (33:52 - 34:04)
Thank you, Commissioner, and Grant, from your team. I also wanted to welcome Jim Majerowicz and John D'Amico from Plumbers Local. Thank you for being here today.

Did you want to add anything on this, or I know the second item is—go ahead, Mr. D'Amico.

[Speaker 25] (34:05 - 34:24)
Good morning, Chairman, members of the committee. I'm John D'Amico from the Plumbers Union. I just want to thank Commissioner Matt Bode and Grant Ulrich for working with us very closely on this issue and all interested parties.

It took a lot of work, but I think now there's no opposition that we know of, and I appreciate an aye vote. Thank you again for all your hard work.

[Speaker 30] (34:28 - 34:44)
My name is Jim Majerowicz with Plumbers Local 130. Again, Commissioner Bode, Matt, great job in this. Grant Ulrich, thank you very much, and look forward to this passing City Council.

[Speaker 1] (34:45 - 34:50)
Great, thank you. Do we have any questions from committee members? Alderman Moore.

[Speaker 12] (34:51 - 36:01)
Thank you, Chairman. First, let me start off by saying I don't know if this came from the department or combination of the Department of Buildings, but thanks for the detail here with the ordinance and the technical corrections. I know sometimes we get information and it's not as clear, and I appreciate that so much.

If the Commissioner can tell me, because I'm not a subject matter expert on these things, but is there anything, I've got a couple of questions, is there anything in here that's really controversial or that we should be looking for that's of concern? I'm reading it through. It seems like it's pretty set forward and you have the support of the plumbing locals, but when it says clarify that buildings at the bottom, clarify Article 5, Section 114X5-506, clarify that the building's life safety evaluation reports may be required to upgrade in connection with permitted work.

I just don't understand that, and so, although it seems, I just don't know what that means.

[Speaker 3] (36:01 - 36:04)
Thank you for that question. I'm going to defer to Grant Ulrich on that.

[Speaker 2] (36:04 - 36:44)
Yeah, so Alderman, if you recall a number of years ago, we had high-rise buildings had to do either retrofit with sprinklers or life safety evaluations, and as those buildings turn over or have new owners, sometimes they're coming in for permitted work, they're doing a major renovation, that may trigger the requirement for sprinklers, and we had some applicants who wanted to, who weren't finding that requirement in the way it was laid out in the code.

So we wanted to make that more clear up front so everyone knew what to expect. So for the buildings that aren't doing any work, they're subject to their life safety evaluation, but if there is a new owner and they're coming in doing major project, they might have to add sprinklers.

[Speaker 12] (36:45 - 37:04)
Okay, all right, I understand that. And then Article 1, Section 3, 4-2288030, clarification, clarify that national certification is not required for Chicago crane license for equipment types where no national certification available.

[Speaker 3] (37:05 - 37:39)
What are we talking about on that? So thank you for that. There are certain pieces of small equipment that is covered under our license that is not covered under the federal certification.

So we didn't want it in a sense where our ordinance technically says you have to have the federal certification, but you're not able to get one because it doesn't exist. So we just wanted to clear up, clean up that language that for certain small pieces of equipment, you still require the city license, but there is no federal certification. So we didn't want that to be a barrier to getting our license.

[Speaker 12] (37:39 - 37:50)
But if they have the federal certification and they have the city license requirement, the city's trumped and the national one, is that what you're saying as well?

[Speaker 3] (37:50 - 38:11)
No, there is no national certification for certain pieces of equipment. Our ordinance is a little bit broader than the federal list of equipment coverage. So for instance, if there's a small piece of equipment that is covered under the Chicago ordinance, but not the federal ordinance, you would just still need the Chicago license because there is no federal certification to get.

[Speaker 12] (38:11 - 38:13)
All right. Thank you, Commissioner. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (38:14 - 38:20)
Thank you, Alderman. I just want to note that we've been joined by Alderman Hopkins and Alderman Cruz for the purposes of quorum. Alderman Dowell.

[Speaker 17] (38:21 - 39:02)
Yes. Thanks. Thank you, Chairman.

Commissioner, Section 4-36-020, License Required, B-5, can you give me some more definition on that? So I just want to be clear. So if a contractor wants to build, I don't know, three or four homes on a plot of on single or privately owned property or city owned property, they would still be required to have this license, right?

They would be required to get a license and a permit?

[Speaker 3] (39:03 - 39:05)
I'd ask Grant Albrecht to clarify that one.

[Speaker 2] (39:06 - 39:34)
Yeah. Thank you, Alderman, for the question. Yeah.

So for new construction, they aren't a homeowner on the site, so they would have to have a general contractor's license. This is an exception for an owner-occupant. It came up in the context of ADUs where the existing ordinance was written as the number of units in the building, and we just wanted to clarify if the owner lived in a single family home and was adding an ADU, a detached ADU coach house on their property, they could be their own general contractor.

[Speaker 17] (39:36 - 40:11)
Okay. That's my only question. Well, no, no, no.

I got another one. Hold on. Can you give some examples under Article 3, Section 1, 14A-4-402.1, add categories of work that do not require a building permit?

These were inadvertently admitted in the 2019 modernization. What are examples of that?

[Speaker 3] (40:12 - 40:13)
Grant, do you have those?

[Speaker 17] (40:13 - 40:14)
Yeah.

[Speaker 2] (40:18 - 40:30)
I'm flipping to that page. Give me one second. Oh, and I'm looking at the next matter up.

That's why I'm not finding it. Let me get to the right ordinance.

[Speaker 17] (40:31 - 40:39)
Oh, so I'm in the other ordinance already. I thought we were taking these together. I'll wait.

[Speaker 2] (40:41 - 41:07)
So one item was the old code that we replaced in 2019 was more clear that certain landscape elements, things like benches and rocks and planters, didn't need a building permit. If you were doing that type of work in the recent context, some businesses have won bad bollards and things on private property. And so we just want to put that exception back in.

[Speaker 17] (41:10 - 41:11)
Okay. Thank you.

[Speaker 5] (41:11 - 41:57)
Great. Thank you. Alvin Ryler.

Thank you, Chairman. I just have a few questions. Obviously, it's encouraging to know that this ordinance has the support of the building trades, but there are a number of changes that are contained in this document.

I wanted to start out with pages eight and nine of the ordinance, shows a table with some fee schedules. There are a number of permit fees and renewals that are either being eliminated or changed. What's the net fiscal impact of this ordinance?

Is this a revenue neutral ordinance or do we expect to see some slide in the revenue we'd be gaining from some of these permits we're now excusing?

[Speaker 3] (41:58 - 42:00)
That's a great question, Alvin. It'll be revenue neutral.

[Speaker 5] (42:01 - 43:49)
Revenue neutral. Great. It would be helpful perhaps through the chair if the department could send committee members, maybe the entire council, just a simple markup side by side of the chart that's contained on pages eight and nine, so we can see what the old fees were that are being replaced with the underscored amended language, as well as those fees that used to be mandatory that are no longer mandatory, and again, just so we have a general accounting of what changes have actually occurred here. It's hard to tell from the amended document, so through the chair, that would be appreciated.

And then just a couple of other questions, just because they kind of popped off the page at me. I'm looking at page four, looking under section 14A-4-402.1, general. No permit is required for the following, and I look at exterior work, it's item eight.

Hardscape elements such as benches, bicycle racks, bollards, planters, and rocks without plumbing or electrical connections not exceeding four feet in height. Very specific description. A number of us in the central business district have been working with CDOT and others to facilitate the installation of bollards and other street furniture to, frankly, harden some targets and to improve public safety for pedestrians and also to deter terrorism threats.

How would this particular language, this new language under exterior work, impact those types of initiatives? Is this something that would simply require verbal permission from your department and from CDOT, or how does that work?

[Speaker 3] (43:50 - 44:46)
That's a great question, too. And this came back because, again, as Grant mentioned, this was under the prior code, we didn't require a permit for this. And in the cleanup in the new one, it was omitted, so we're putting it back in.

But we do receive a lot of questions from businesses, especially with bollards, to protect their business. Also, bollards are used in parking lots a lot now because cars have been driving into the buildings accidentally, not the smashing grass, but just in general for the security of the building. A lot of folks have been putting in bollards and other planters and other things to protect the building.

And we just want to make sure that they don't have to get a permit for that and that they're not unnecessarily spending time and resources getting a permit, that they can, in fact, put those in.

[Speaker 5] (44:47 - 44:58)
No, and I appreciate that, but I assume there's some checkpoint in the process whereby we give permission for folks to install these things on our public infrastructure.

[Speaker 3] (44:58 - 45:22)
Public infrastructure, absolutely. That would be CDOT. So we don't permit items on the public way.

That's CDOT. That's another clarification and disordinance that we don't want folks coming to us, spending resources on attorneys and others, and expeditors trying to get a permit that they actually don't require from us, and that's properly directed to CDOT.

[Speaker 5] (45:23 - 45:45)
Okay. And then finally on page four, under permanent structures, item five, utility vaults and similar structures, located entirely below the public way, but structurally independent from any structure joining it. So this would mean this does not apply to vaulted sidewalks where the building owner adjacent to it is occupying the vault.

Is that correct?

[Speaker 2] (45:47 - 46:01)
When they're structurally connected, yes, as some of the old ones are. And this is just, again, clarifying that jurisdiction between us and CDOT. So if it's entirely in the public way, we want to let CDOT handle that without confusion about two departments having to weigh in.

[Speaker 5] (46:01 - 46:40)
Very good. And then my final question, thank you for your indulgence, Chairman, is on page 10, and it's under section 214B-10-1004, occupant load. The provisions of section 1004 of IBC are adopted by reference with the following modifications.

1.2, revise table 1004.5 by changing the value for, quote, gaming floors, kino slots, etc. under assembly from 11 gross to 15 gross. That is very specific language.

Could you explain what that is applying to? I think I could guess.

[Speaker 3] (46:41 - 46:54)
Yeah, sure. We didn't have casinos in Chicago when the code was written, and now we do. So we want to make sure that we have take that into account and that we place that in our code.

[Speaker 5] (46:55 - 47:04)
Can you just explain to myself and my colleagues what this language means? Yeah, Grant, I'll give the technical explanation. 11 gross, 15 gross, that sounds like an increase in something.

[Speaker 2] (47:05 - 48:10)
Sure. So the code has a very large table that isn't reproduced here that sets forth floor area per person assumptions about various types of buildings. And so when the fire department and the building department have been meeting with the proposed casino for the permanent site, they use the existing value for designing the temporary site.

In looking at the permanent site, there was a conversation. We looked at national figures, and they did some math to show us that the model code value that had been adopted as part of the 2019 ordinance did not make sense based on the layout of casinos today. And so with the fire department's support and agreement, we're putting forward this change to say that 15 gross square feet of floor area is equal to one person for designing both the number of exits required and also the number of toilet fixtures required for a casino gaming floor.

[Speaker 5] (48:10 - 48:17)
So is this then, in a way, increasing capacity at the permanent site for the casino?

[Speaker 2] (48:17 - 48:21)
No, it's actually decreasing capacity.

[Speaker 5] (48:23 - 48:37)
So what would the impact be on daily attendance figures projected for the casino with this change? Would that have an impact on the casino's ability to bring in money to help service the pensions?

[Speaker 2] (48:38 - 49:11)
No, I don't think so. Actually, I think this is still a conservative value in terms of if you drew 15 square feet of floor space, I don't think any casino that I've ever been to, not that I've been to many, but in Vegas, I've never seen one that crowded, even at 15 square feet and 11 square feet, even more dramatic. So it's adjusting the amount of the width of exits required and the amount of restroom facilities required.

[Speaker 5] (49:11 - 49:26)
Very good. I know we're not having capacity issues with the temporary casino, not terribly full, but thank you for answering my questions. And again, I appreciate you working with our partners and organized labor to get this right.

Thank you. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (49:26 - 49:37)
Thank you, Alderman Reilly. We've been joined by Alders Fuentes, Ramirez Rosa, and Mosley for purposes of quorum. I have Alderman Villegas with the last question, unless there's any others.

[Speaker 12] (49:38 - 49:40)
Chairman, the question was asked and answered.

[Speaker 1] (49:41 - 49:41)
OK, great.

[Speaker 22] (49:41 - 50:04)
Thank you. Alderman Hopkins. Mr. Chairman, I hope this question wasn't asked already. It's on page 12, Article 5, subsequent rehab work. Could this provision be used to mandate a sprinkler retrofit in a residential high-rise constructed prior to 1975?

[Speaker 3] (50:09 - 50:15)
I'll let Grant Talbott answer that. That was discussed earlier, but he's happy to repeat it.

[Speaker 2] (50:16 - 50:50)
Yes. So Alderman Moore asked a similar question earlier, not if it's an existing building and they aren't doing major work. But we had I think we've had two projects come through where there was a new owner.

They were doing almost a gut rehabilitation and they wanted to say they didn't need to put in a sprinkler system with that level of work. We wanted to make clear two different places in the code that talk about it. We're just adding this language here so that an applicant isn't confused and doesn't think they can avoid adding a sprinkler as part of a major rehab, but not a retroactive requirement.

[Speaker 22] (50:50 - 51:01)
Okay. And is the application of this provision separate and distinct in any way if we're talking about an exclusively commercial building versus an exclusively residential building?

[Speaker 2] (51:01 - 51:25)
No, it would be similar. It would be clarifying that in the part that talks about remodeling, there are certain triggers that would say at that point you're doing a major amount of remodeling and it triggers life safety upgrades, which could include a sprinkler system and just adding this language in the section that dealt with the ordinance that covered life safety evaluations and allowing certain existing buildings not to make those upgrades.

[Speaker 22] (51:26 - 51:39)
And then how soon in the process would the example that you gave with the new owner coming in with their rehab plan, how soon in the process would they be informed that you don't have sprinklers and you're going to need them because of this work you're planning?

[Speaker 2] (51:40 - 52:12)
Yeah, so certainly as soon as they come in and meet with us, that would be explained clearly. We're adding this to the code because most applicants start working with professionals, architects, lawyers beforehand, and we had at least one project where their outside advisor thought that they wouldn't need it, and then by the time they did come to us after spending a fair amount of time analyzing the project, we told them, you missed the section of the code. So just adding this language in the second place that's addressed in the code to make it more clear to everyone up front.

[Speaker 22] (52:13 - 52:21)
OK, and minimize unwelcome surprises, which I'm sure that was in the case you're disrupted. All right. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (52:22 - 53:22)
Hearing no other questions by committee members, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderman Riley still moves. Any objections?

Hearing none, the ordinance is passed. Next up is mayoral introduction of document number 02023-0006382, Amendment of Municipal Code Titles 2 and 4 regarding licensing of apprentice plumbers, plumbers and plumbing contractors. This item has a substitute.

All members of the committee should have received a copy of the substitute as well as a summary electronically. You'll also find a copy in your folder. At this time, I would ask for a motion to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Alderperson Fuentes motions to accept the substitute. Any objections? Hearing none, the substitute is before us.

Once again, we have Building Commissioner Matt Beaudet here and Grant Ulrich, Deputy Commissioner, as well as Jim Majerowicz and John D'Amico, the Plumbers Union, to answer any questions. Commissioner Beaudet.

[Speaker 3] (53:27 - 53:31)
Chairman, we kind of had both of the ordinances together.

[Speaker 1] (53:31 - 53:54)
I didn't read them both in, but if we had the discussion, were there any questions specifically about the plumbers piece? The second ordinance that was the mayoral introduction. Hearing none, can I get a motion to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

Alderwoman Clay, so moves. Any objections? Hearing none, the ordinance is passed as amended.

Thank you all very much.

[Speaker 2] (53:54 - 53:55)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (53:57 - 55:52)
Next are large signs over 100 square feet in area, 24 feet above grade. We will hear them all together. I will read the ward, followed by the address and take a motion at the end.

In the first ward, 2257 West North Avenue. In the first ward, 2160 North Milwaukee Avenue. In the 23rd ward, 5417 South Pulaski Road.

Two signs in the 27th ward located at 1015 North Halstead Street. In the 28th ward, 801 South Canal Streets. Four signs in the 28th ward located at 1101 South Canal Street.

In the 38th ward, 4734 North Cumberland. In the 38th ward, 5859 West Irving Park Road. Two signs in the 46th ward located at 3601 North Halstead Street.

Two signs in the 46th ward located at 804 West Montrose Avenue. And lastly, one sign in the 50th ward located at 6450 North California Avenue. If no questions by committee members, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

Alderman Conway still moves. Any objections? Hearing none, the orders are passed.

We will now move on to the map amendments. In an effort to ensure the committee meeting runs as smoothly as possible, items will be grouped together according to witness and will be heard in that order rather than ward order. All right.

All right, first item is in the 28th ward. I don't see Alderman Irvin or a staff person. So we will pass on that.

Next up is item number A, 8854 in the 34th ward. Ordinance referred 10-423. Common address is 10 South Dearborn Street.

A change request is plan development 882 to DC-16 downtown core district. We have zoning administrator Patrick Murphy to speak on this.

[Speaker 29] (55:52 - 56:10)
Sorry, Chairman, I was getting something. Could you read the intro again? Okay.

Can you give me the intro again, the number again?

[Speaker 1] (56:10 - 56:15)
Sure. It's the second item on page 2. It's 10 South Dearborn.

[Speaker 19] (56:17 - 57:20)
Okay. That is a longer term. I'm sorry.

First of all, Patrick Murphy with the Department of Planning. That was a longer-term approach by the department to look at how to address reuse of portions of this building in light of requirements within the plan development that dealt with access through lobby space. The plan development was established to legalize a sign that exists on top of the building.

When the municipal code was revised in 2018 to address high-rise signage, the resulting calculations established that or allowed that sign to remain as a nonconformity, essentially meaning that you could not get a sign that large at that height above grade. The sunset of this plan development will not impact the only element of that PD, which was, again, to establish that sign. So the PD has served its usefulness and can be sunset back to regular base downtown core zoning.

[Speaker 1] (57:21 - 57:25)
Great. Thank you. Alderman Conway, did you want to add anything on this?

[Speaker 23] (57:25 - 57:39)
Only to say that removing this plan development will address some security concerns, and as someone who actually worked in this very building for several years, I'm uniquely aware of the need here, and I'm proud to support this. Thank you. Great.

Any questions by committee members?

[Speaker 1] (57:41 - 58:27)
If not, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? All the first and point days moves do pass. Any objections?

Hearing none, this item is passed. Next item is in the 35th ward. I know Alderman Ramirez-Rosa was here.

We're going to wait for him to return. Bottom of page two, item number A8861 in the 43rd ward. Ordinance referred 11.1.23. Common address is 601 to 609 West Diversity Parkway, and 2726 to 2736 North Lehman Court. Change request is plan development 1301 to a B35 community shopping district. And we have Isabella Correa here from the 43rd ward.

[Speaker 13] (58:28 - 1:00:08)
Hi, my name is Isabella Correa. I'm the director of zoning and sustainable urban development for the 43rd ward. As he cannot present today, I'll be speaking on behalf of Alderman Knudson, the applicant for number A8861, ordinance 11-1-23.

The common address is 601-609 West Diversity Parkway and 2726 through 2736 North Lehman Court. The Alderman is requesting a change from plan development 1302 to B3-5 community shopping district. PD 1302 was originally passed in 2016, but the construction never commenced on the approved hotel that was attached to the PD.

As they didn't apply for an extension, the approval for the project lapsed January 13th, 2021, five years after its approval. And our office has been made aware that the applicant of the approved hotel project is no longer moving forward. The request changed to B3-5 is due to the provisions outlined in the PD's original plan development statements.

Section 15 of business plan development statements states that the plan development shall be governed by section 17-13-0612 of the zoning ordinance. Should the PD ordinance lapse, the Commissioner of the Department of Planning and Development shall initiate a zoning map amendment to rezone the property to a B3-5 community shopping district. As this process was not initiated when it lapsed in 2021, the Alderman is requesting to sunset this PD to ensure the burden of sunsetting does not fall onto any future developer as the onus of sunsetting the PD upon its lapse is that of the city.

Thank you for your time and consideration in this matter, and I'd be happy to answer any questions you have regarding the requested zoning change.

[Speaker 1] (1:00:09 - 1:01:07)
Great. Thank you, Ms. Correa. The Alderperson immediately to the north on the north side of diversity is also in support of this zoning change.

That's me. Any questions by committee members? Hearing none, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

Alderman Laspada moves to pass. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

We'll go back to the item in the 35th ward. Alderman Ramirez Rosa is here. Questions from the public about the zoning change?

Let's move to document number. A 8, 8 5 0. The 35th word ordinance referred 9 1423 Common address is 29 31 to 57 North Milwaukee Avenue.

And 29 12 to 29 34 North Milwaukee Avenue. Proposed change to D designate as a pedestrian street, a segment of the North Milwaukee right of way. From the center line of North Gresham Avenue and North Drake Avenue on the southeast.

and the centerline of North Central Park Avenue on the northwest. Alderman Ramirez-Rosa.

[Speaker 16] (1:01:07 - 1:02:29)
Thank you, Mr. Chair. This is a temporary and necessary de-designation of the Peace Street along this stretch of Milwaukee Avenue. There is a building there at the corner, which is formerly the Orbit Banquet Hall, a very famous Polish banquet hall, if you're familiar with Polish history, on the northwest side of the city of Chicago.

But the building some years ago was rehabbed and readapted from a banquet hall into a commercial and residential building. The anchor tenant was a bank, which established a drive-thru ATM. During the pandemic, that bank closed.

A bank is now seeking to re-establish their operations there, and they would like to reopen that drive-thru ATM. So everything is there, we just need to temporarily lift this Peace Street designation so that they can get their permits for the drive-thru, and then once they get their permits, we will put the Peace Street designation back in place. So that's pretty much it.

We did talk to Logan Square Preservation, which was the community group involved with helping to preserve this building when it was first changed from a banquet hall into a commercial building with a bank. And they are supportive of this change, since putting the bank there helped preserve this historic and important building.

[Speaker 1] (1:02:30 - 1:03:31)
Great, thank you. Any questions by committee members? Seeing none, Alderman Moore, moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, this item is passed. All right, on the top of page three, item number 22178 in the 27th ward, ordinance referred 52423, common address is 420 North May Street.

Change request, M23, Light Industry District to DX5, Downtown Mixed Use District, and then to a planned development. We have Mariah Degrino from DLA Parper here to present. This item was heard and passed by the Chicago Plan Commission, and I have a motion to incorporate all the records and findings from that hearing by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Alderman LaSpada still moves. Any objections? Hearing none, the records are incorporated.

Ms. Degrino.

[Speaker 14] (1:03:33 - 1:04:36)
Thank you, Vice Chair and members of the committee. My name is Mariah Degrino with the law firm of DLA Piper, representing the applicant in this matter, 420 N. May Property, LLC, which is an entity controlled by Crescent Heights.

I'm joined by, on my immediate left, Tom Pope with HPA, the project architect. To his left is Jason Buckberg with Crescent Heights, and to Jason's left is Peter Lemon with Kimley Horn, our traffic consultant. The site is located on the north side of West Kinsey between North May Street and North Racine Street.

The proposed development would allow for the construction of a 587 unit residential building with ground floor commercial, co-working, and amenity space. The team engaged in a very robust review process with the city, in particular with the departments of planning, housing, and transportation, and with community organizations, including West Central Association, Neighbors of River West, and Neighbors of West Loop. I do see that Alderman Burnett is here.

We understand he's in support of the project as well. We're here to answer any questions, but thank you for your consideration of this matter.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:37 - 1:04:41)
Thank you. Vice Mayor Burnett, anything you wanted to add?

[Speaker 9] (1:04:42 - 1:05:43)
Sure, thank you, Mr. Chairman. So as the councilor said, they did meet with several community organizations in my ward. We had a community meeting also.

From that community meeting, there was input from the community for which we actually had them to bring the building down and change some of the designs of the building. They adhered to all of those things. They've been working in coordination with the Department of Housing in reference to the affordable housing.

As you know, with the ARO over in this area, we had to do 20%, but it's encouraged to try and do 30%. And they've been working with the Department of Housing in order to try to reach that goal, to make it a goal. I'm OK with this.

My community's OK with it, as for the committee's support. Great, thank you. Questions?

Alderman LaSpada?

[Speaker 10] (1:05:45 - 1:06:01)
More like positive comments. So as someone who was at Planning Commission for this, not only is it everything that Vice Mayor Burnett is saying, but we're talking about, I think I remember you all saying, close to 10,000 of publicly and privately accessible open space on this development.

[Speaker 14] (1:06:02 - 1:06:23)
I believe the publicly accessible open space figure is 3,750 square feet. That's that little green piece right at the corner there. I think the total amount of the open space for the entire project is north of 77,000 square feet.

But the 10,000 square feet, I'm going to ask Tom to weigh in on the amount of ground level in total.

[Speaker 1] (1:06:25 - 1:06:26)
I'll state your name for the record.

[Speaker 27] (1:06:26 - 1:06:45)
Good morning. For the record, Tom Pope with HPA. To answer your question, yeah, actually there's close to 12,000 square feet of, call it, open to sky area that is outside of the building envelope that is on or around grade.

And so that obviously contributes to light and air setbacks, all the public benefit that comes with that.

[Speaker 10] (1:06:45 - 1:07:20)
I remember that. It was outstanding. I mean, you can't see it from the distance that we're seeing on the screen.

But the care that went into, particularly the publicly accessible open spaces, the thoughtfulness of how you incorporated community feedback on that is really great. And again, hard to see in the rendering. Worth looking up the Planning Commission presentation because the care that went into thinking about how this building intersects, there it is, how it intersects with the streetscape is really phenomenal.

It's really impressive what you all have put together here. Really grateful. Thank you.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:07:20 - 1:07:31)
Thank you, sir. Thank you, Alderman. Any other questions?

Hearing none, Alderman LaSpada makes the motion do pass. By the same, do pass, oh, I'm sorry. Yes, Vice Mayor.

[Speaker 9] (1:07:31 - 1:07:52)
I think that it would be appropriate if we recognize how much Neighborhood Opportunity Funds is going to come from this project. Can you say how many dollars that are coming to Neighborhood Opportunity Funds, which is going to be spent in other people's wards, but if you can acknowledge that, please.

[Speaker 14] (1:07:53 - 1:08:05)
I can. Thank you again, Mariah DeGrino. The FAR bonus payment here, which will go into that fund, is $5.3 million. $4.2 million of that will go into the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund.

[Speaker 1] (1:08:09 - 1:08:53)
Impressive. Great. Thank you.

Any other questions on this project? No. All right, hearing none, Alderman LaSpada makes the motion do pass as revised by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed. Thank you.

Next up, item number 22322 in the fourth ward. Ordinance referred 12-13-23. Common address is 717 to 739 South Clark Street.

Change request is DX-12, Downtown Mixed-Use District to DX-16, Downtown Mixed-Use District. We have Rich Clowder from DLA to present.

[Speaker 6] (1:08:54 - 1:09:52)
Morning, Mr. Chair, members of the committee for the record. Rich Clowder from DLA Piper. I represent the applicant in this matter, 739 South Clark Holdings LLC, which is a single purpose entity controlled by CMK, whose principal, Colin Kincaid, is with me today.

The site, very briefly, is located on the east side of Clark between Harrison and Polk. The zoning request here is to rezone from DX-12 to DX-16 to facilitate the conversion of approximately 60,000 square feet of what is currently vacant commercial space to up to 68 additional residential units in this residential building. Project, excuse me, the project team engaged in a very robust community process led by Alderman Robinson, including meetings and support from, meetings with and support from the South Loop Neighbors and Near South Planning Board.

You should have in your file a letter of support from Alderman Robinson, and we are, of course, available for questions, but respectfully request that this body recommend approval to the full city council. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:09:52 - 1:10:12)
Thank you. Any questions by committee members? We do have a letter from Alderman Robinson.

I don't know that he has a staff person here to speak. If no questions, do I get a motion to pass? Yes.

Do we have renderings of this? We can send them, certainly.

[Speaker 6] (1:10:13 - 1:10:28)
It's an existing building, Alderman. No other changes are being made to the building other than the conversion of vacant commercial space to residential space, but happy to provide you with a snapshot of the building through the chair.

[Speaker 1] (1:10:30 - 1:11:10)
Thank you. Anything else? All right, hearing no other questions, Vice Mayor Burnett moves do pass.

Any objections? Hearing none, this item is passed. Thank you.

Best of luck to you. Bottom of page three in the 27th ward, document number 2284, ordinance referred, 11.1.23. Common address is 1016 to 1020 West Lake Street. Change request, C11, Neighborhood Commercial District and C12, Neighborhood Commercial District to DX7, Downtown Mixed Use District and then to a residential business plan development.

Once again, we have the attorney, Rich Clowder.

[Speaker 6] (1:11:11 - 1:11:40)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Again, Rich Clowder from the law firm of DLA Piper representing the applicants 718 LLC and West Lake Chicago Investors. I'm joined today by Errol Stapleton, who is a principal with the development entity.

As a preliminary matter, this application also was considered and recommended for approval at last week's January 18th plan commission hearing. So I think it would be appropriate to request that the transcript from that hearing be incorporated into the record of this proceeding.

[Speaker 1] (1:11:40 - 1:11:52)
Thank you. Can I have a motion to incorporate all records and findings from that hearing by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderman Dowell so moves.

Any objection? Hearing none, the records are incorporated. Thank you.

[Speaker 6] (1:11:52 - 1:13:15)
Very briefly, the subject property is located at the northeast corner of Lake and Carpenter Streets in the Fulton Market District. It consists of approximately 10,105 square feet. As the chair mentioned, the property is currently zoned C-1-1 and C-1-2 and it will be rezoned to an underlying DX7 prior to establishing a business plan development.

Subject property will be improved with a 220 foot tall hotel with up to 143 keys. The overall FAR will be 11.5 resulting in a bonus payment of in excess of $1 million to the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund. Project will create approximately 150 construction jobs and is anticipated to cost around $65 million to complete.

Every project in the 27th Ward receives robust community input and we had several community meetings with local stakeholders culminating in a community-wide meeting. The ultimate building design was transformed and most notably has an unprecedented degree of sustainability features. The building will be LEED Gold and aspires to be the first carbon neutral hotel project undertaken in the city.

Thanks especially to Alderman Burnett and DPD for their review of and feedback on the project. We respectfully request that this body recommend approval to the full city council. Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (1:13:15 - 1:13:16)
Right, thank you.

[Speaker 9] (1:13:16 - 1:14:03)
Vice Mayor Burnett, anything you wanted to add? Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman. The council has said it all.

He did meet with several community organizations in my ward, the Neighbors of the West Loop and West Central Association. We also had a community meeting which was pretty much a no brainer. No one had any complaints.

This was a very easy building. Money is going to Neighborhood Opportunity Fund, 1,175 jobs. And I'd be remiss if I did not mention the last project that was before us is gonna have between 700 and 1,000 jobs coming to the city of Chicago.

So all of these developments are helping the city and a million dollars going into the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund. I support this, my community support it. We ask for your support.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:14:03 - 1:14:09)
Thank you, Vice Mayor. Any questions by committee members? Hearing none.

Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, Alderman Spada.

[Speaker 10] (1:14:10 - 1:15:21)
And again, like, I mean, y'all come to the plan commission. They present on this for a half hour and we're glossing over some really exciting stuff that deserves its flowers. If you would go back.

Yes, let's talk about this because it's really exciting. The fact, what are y'all committed to? It's supposed to be 100 points.

Is that right? Which that the commitments are 130, that they're going above and beyond our sustainable development policy to 175 points. In four years, I have never seen anyone do that voluntarily.

Notably, like, I just want to call out little, little words, left-hand corner, bird protection policy. This is something that our colleague, Alderman Hopkins, fought for last year to be incorporated into the sustainable development policy. To see someone actually incorporate that was really exciting.

To see y'all think about not only the energy and emissions on the backend, but also on the front end of your building materials. This is really exciting to see someone taking this account into development in Chicago. So I just wanted to call it out and give more credit where it's due.

Thank you.

[Speaker 6] (1:15:21 - 1:15:22)
Thank you for your kind words, Alderman.

[Speaker 10] (1:15:23 - 1:15:24)
You're welcome. Thank you, Chair.

[Speaker 1] (1:15:24 - 1:15:41)
Thank you, Alderman. Anyone else on this? All right.

Seeing none, Alderman LaSpada makes a motion do pass as revised by the same motion that was used to determine, same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, this item is passed.

[Speaker 6] (1:15:41 - 1:15:42)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (1:15:42 - 1:16:06)
Thank you both. Good luck. Top of page four is item number 22249 in the 34th ward.

Ordinance referred 91423. Common address is 354 North Union Avenue. Change requests, plan development 1320 to plan development 1320 as amended.

We have attorney Edward Kuss to present.

[Speaker 7] (1:16:10 - 1:16:42)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. Good morning. My name is Ed Kuss with the law firm of Taft located at 111 East Wacker in Chicago.

And I'm appearing on behalf of the applicant, Annie 352 North Union, Chicago LLC. Joining me, sitting to my left, is Mr. John Grieger, development manager for the applicant. Mr. Chairman, as a preliminary matter, this matter was heard by the Chicago Plan Commission on December 21st, 2023. And I would ask that the record of proceedings be incorporated into this hearing.

[Speaker 1] (1:16:43 - 1:16:57)
Thank you. Can I have a motion to incorporate all records and findings from the plan commission hearing by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderman Dowell so moves.

Any objections? Hearing none, the records are incorporated. Please continue.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 7] (1:16:58 - 1:19:19)
The subject property is located at 354 North Union Street and 355 North Halstead Street. It has two entrances, one on the east and one on the west. There's an existing high rise building built just a couple of years ago as PD 1320 was approved in 2018.

The existing building contains 373 dwelling units with 170 parking spaces. And the height of the building is approximately 380 feet. This is an amendment to residential plan development number 1320.

The purpose of the amendment is twofold. First to add lodging as a permitted use and that lodging would include a limited number of hotel rooms and other lodging units for short term rentals less than 30 days. There's also a modification of the open space plan, which is located at the southwest corner of the property.

The open space consists of about 14,000 square feet and will be used for a combination of green space, pickleball court, basketball court, et cetera. The maximum number of hotel rooms would be 56. And for each furnished unit used as a hotel room, the number of residential apartments would be reduced by one or be a one for one swap.

In this building, there would be four floors used for the hotel rooms and that would be four floors, five to eight. Each floor has about 14 units. And again, these are geared for stays of less than 30 days.

The typical user for the furnished apartments is the corporate traveler and family oriented users, which lends itself to having a longer than average stay than a traditional hotel room. The applicant has partnerships with Google, Apple and Microsoft as a robust business with corporate travelers. The applicant has utilized this business model at a couple of its other buildings here in Chicago and in addition to its buildings in Vancouver, Seattle and Los Angeles.

And just to be clear, nothing in the existing building will be changing physically. The furnished units already exist and they will just be rented out on a short term basis rather than a long term basis. And lastly, this will not impact any of the affordable units currently on site.

The number of units will remain the same and not change. And we would be happy to answer any questions if there are any.

[Speaker 1] (1:19:20 - 1:19:22)
Great, thank you. Alderman Conway, do you wanna add anything?

[Speaker 23] (1:19:24 - 1:19:33)
Council alluded to this adds a small amount of multi-day hotel rooms and bring some much needed green space to 34th Ward and I'm happy to support it, thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:19:33 - 1:20:11)
Great, thank you. Any other questions by committee members? Hearing none, Alderperson Fuentes moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Hearing any objections? Hearing none, this item is passed as revised. Thank you.

Thank you, Alderman. Best of luck. Thank you.

Next, item number 223, 305 in the 11th Ward. Ordinance referred 12, 13, 23. Common address is 4161 to 93 South Halstead Street.

Change requests, B32, Community Shopping District to B22, Neighborhood Mixed Use District. We have attorney Paul Colpac to present.

[Speaker 20] (1:20:11 - 1:21:10)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. Paul Colpac, officer at 6767 North Milwaukee Avenue. Represent the applicant CASPER Development, Mr. Daniel Spiebel, who's the sole member manager of the LLC. As you mentioned, we're requesting the zoning change from the B3-2, Community Shopping District to that of B2-2, Neighborhood Mixed Use District. Property in question is one zoning lot of approximately 44,244 feet. What we plan on doing is subdividing the lots to 14 individual lots to construct 14 single-family homes with two-car garages and alley access for those garages.

We had a community meeting in Alderman Lee's ward. We had favorable response. My client has built a number of units in her ward, and I believe we have a letter of support from the Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (1:21:11 - 1:21:21)
Thank you. We do have a letter from Alderman Lee. I don't believe a staff person is here.

I have a question. What was 44,000 square feet? What was the previous user?

[Speaker 20] (1:21:21 - 1:21:22)
It was just a vacant piece of property.

[Speaker 1] (1:21:22 - 1:22:02)
For a long-term? Okay, great. Any other questions by committee members?

Hearing none, Alderman Dahl moves due pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Thank you. Next, the bottom of page four, item number 22304 in the 25th ward. Ordinance referred 12, 13, 23.

Common address is 2149 to 59 South Paulina Street and 1658 West Cermak Road. Change request, RT4, residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to C12 neighborhood commercial district. Here to present, we have Jimena Castro.

[Speaker 4] (1:22:11 - 1:23:06)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Jimena Castro, a zoning attorney at Acosta As Group for the record. I'm here today, as you mentioned, to represent the applicant for the property located at the address commonly known as 1658 West Cermak on the corner of Cermak and Paulina.

The property is a restaurant located in RT4 district that had an aldermanic zoning change to a residential district in 2015. We're seeking to rezone the property to a C12 zoning district to allow a general restaurant use and to legalize the existing restaurant. And we conducted a community-led process with Alderman Byron's office, and we have his support and his zoning committee support as well.

We would like to ask for a favorable consideration.

[Speaker 1] (1:23:06 - 1:23:25)
Thank you. Any questions by committee members? We do have a letter of support from Alderman Siccio-Lopez.

It looks like he stepped out. Hearing no questions, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to the Kerman quorum? Alderman Dalmo's do pass.

Any objections? Hearing none, this item is passed.

[Speaker 4] (1:23:26 - 1:23:27)
Thank you.

[Speaker 15] (1:36:34 - 1:38:12)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My name is Roland Burris II. I am the attorney representing the applicant, the Boa Group Incorporated, who is also the owner of the property.

I am joined here today by Mr. Kingsley Ihai-Winman of the Boa Group, Mr. Matt Brown of the Boa Group, and Megan Moyer, who will be the architect for the project. The property is located at 6534 and 36 South Dorchester. The property is currently two side-by-side vacant lots that are topped with grass.

They measure approximately 25 feet by 95 feet. We are seeking a change from the RS2, residential single unit detached house district to RT4, residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district. For the purpose of constructing a two story, two dwelling units with basements and two two car garages.

Approval of the proposed map amendment will facilitate the development of two contemporary designed single family homes that each feature an additional dwelling unit, bringing both stability of single family housing and the affordability of an additional dwelling unit to the final two parcels of vacant land remaining to be developed on the 6500 block of South Dorchester Avenue. We have a letter of support from the aldermen. And at this time, we'd like to ask for the support of the committee.

Thank you. Any questions?

I'm so happy to see that as part of the project. I'm hearing no other questions. Alderwoman Dow moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine form.

Any objections? Hearing none, this item is passed. Thank you.

There being no further business before the committee, Alderperson Fuentes makes the motion to adjourn. Any objections? Hearing none, we are adjourned.
