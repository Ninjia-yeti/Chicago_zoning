[Speaker 26] (13:59 - 16:59)
Mark? Good morning committee members my name is Mark Kaplan I'm a board member of Northside Action for Justice and an LSC member at Uplift Community High School more importantly I have lived and been active in the uptown community since the early 1970s we are calling on the zoning committee to reject the proposed zoning change and the proposal for the development of 314 units of almost exclusively upper income smaller unit rental housing at 4600 North Marine Drive we know that this proposed development one is not needed and does not meet the needs of our community and our residents two will exacerbate and accelerate the current trend of high-end development that has pushed thousands of residents families and seniors out because of the loss of affordable units and rapidly rising rents and three will be another advancement to the policies that support white supremacy and racial racial segregation transforming uptown one of the most diverse and affordable communities in one of the most segregated cities into another area for upper income whites like Lincoln Park community and housing patterns do not happen accidentally they occur as a result of policy and policy decisions that are made by those in power like you the zoning committee we have seen the community that we have built come under severe attack in the last decade we have lost over a thousand units of affordable housing and two thousand units of upper income housing have either been built or in the process we have been here before in front of the zoning committee many times over the years we were here in the 1990s when the gold glass building redevelopment plan was being considered we urged the zoning committee to reject that proposal and support a community plan for development the zoning committee rejected the community and voted yes we were here about five years ago urging the zoning committee to reject the proposal for a high income development and Montrose and Clarence the zoning committee rejected the community and voted yes these two high income developments close to five thousand units were subsidized by close to 30 million dollars in pivot funds the residents of these developments are mostly white and almost all upper income while our schools and parks all over the city in each of your wards are starving for resources our tax dollars are being used to support white entitlement and racial segregation we are calling on you to use your power to reject the proposed zoning change and development it is in your power to not allow for the advancement of racial segregation and to stand up for real equity in housing and development that Chicago sorely needs we are urging you to do the right thing and reject the zoning change and proposal thank you very much

[Speaker 1] (17:01 - 17:17)
thank you Mr. Kaplan our next speaker is Marianne Lalonde hello my name is Dr. Marianne Lalonde and

[Speaker 25] (17:17 - 20:10)
I am the president of the Lakeside Area Neighbors Association the block club immediately adjacent to 4600 North Marine Drive today I'm going to talk to you about how you should deny or at minimum defer and publish the zoning change because the negative impacts reach beyond our ward they will reach your ward and they will reach the entire city we cannot reward a hospital owner selling this land who lied to state regulators to get a 17 million dollar lien for another health care company with a zoning change Illinois taxpayers paid a lot of money to get health care to the community that pipeline lied to and abandoned at the same time they were lying to state regulators about Melrose Park they were putting Weiss's lakefront land up for sale for a use that's not allowed in the PD without one iota of conversation with neighbors we don't know what their acquisition agreement for Weiss entails and they would not provide it upon request the loss of any city hospital crowds remaining city hospitals some in your wards impacting your constituents keeping the remainder of the hospital zone for hospital use after this land is sold will do nothing it will make the hospital infrastructure less attractive to future purchasers because it will have no land for expansion this project gentrifies an area on the north side that represents predominantly people of color your colleague Alderman Kappelman refused to let a 400 plus unit HUD subsidized co-op with predominantly black residents participate in the community feedback process for this development because of a procedural snafu think about if you want to allow this to move forward without input from that building amidst that an expansion of Sarah's circle a woman's homeless shelter is dependent on the in lieu of fees from this development will be perpetuated during the presentation in actuality accepting this project will cut in half the number of affordable units over 60 that we could add to a census track where all kinds of people both renters and owners already deeply support affordable housing if Lincoln properties built their afford required affordable on-site and Sarah's circle uses other means that both Sarah's circle and the housing department have said are available we would actually get more affordable housing in uptown and on the north side finally the LPO application from this developer is embarrassingly light and doesn't take into account the resilience of critical infrastructure delivery water and power on the site map DPD mislabeled critical infrastructure lakeview pumping station entirely putting a Claire in the park label over the whole thing south side alderman know about the dangers of compromising pumping stations because of the two outages the Roseland pumping station had in May resulting in no water for their constituents no environmental impact studies were completed three members of the Chicago plan commission voted no on the lakefront protection ordinance which is very unusual considering most votes are unanimous a minimum number of bird safety mechanisms were applied next to a bird sanctuary housing endangered species this development in dangerous health care represents increasing increasing racial inequities on the north side and compromises critical infrastructure due to its environmental responsibility I am asking you to deny or defer and publish the zoning change

[Speaker 1] (20:13 - 20:25)
Marianne our next speaker is Ana Guevara good morning committee members my name is Professor

[Speaker 24] (20:25 - 23:27)
Ana Guevara I am a university professor and a researcher of uptown's history an immigrant from the Philippines and a north side resident I am opposed to the rezoning of the white hospital parking lot on 4600 north marine drive for a number of reasons which I have detailed in my letter but I mentioned a few here uptown has been a portal for immigrants many of whom have been displaced due to structural violence that disproportionately affects the poor and communities of color in the past 30 years alone the census tells us that the racial demographic of uptown reveals the grave whitening of this neighborhood with a white population in uptown today constituting over half of the population of town today at 54 percent while minoritized populations have declined steadily there has also been a decline of low-income residents in uptown with the median income steadily increasing over the years research has shown that concentrating new housing and communities of color accelerates demographic change and that this change could be unsettling or alienating for long-time residents empirical studies compellingly reveal that there is a disproportionate impact of gentrification on poor and minoritized communities that there is a direct correlation between gentrification and displacement and between creating luxury apartments and the decline in affordable housing research also reveals that development can be further problematic if it comes in spite of community resistance to it the uptown community does not want the rezoning of 4600 take a look at the history of pipeline and Lincoln property not only did pipeline close the Westlake hospital six months after its purchase and after pledging to the public that they will not sell any of the hospitals but bankruptcy transcripts revealed that pipeline had a secret deal with tenants to close the hospital as a condition of sale Lincoln property has not only been involved in a long racial discrimination suit in Texas but its proposed building does not meet the needs of uptown for on-site affordable housing for families this proposal only meets the bare minimum ARO standards how can that be acceptable especially when a new law is about to take effect that will double the minimum required to five percent in relation to Sarah's circle we ought to strive for supporting the work of Sarah's circle as well as providing on-site affordable housing and not put them in opposition with one another also the proposed building would develop land that is zoned for medical or research work not residential use which puts uptown health care and the community's local economic future in danger why then should the city put their trust in pipeline and Lincoln property given their dubious history and a proposal that meets only the bare minimum standards of affordability why settle for less when so much is at stake please help us build a community that is equitable sustainable and one that the people of uptown need I urge you to reject this proposal or at the very minimum defer and publish it thank

[Speaker 1] (23:27 - 25:15)
you thank you Anna I believe that concludes the public comment period we're going to start today's meeting with the first item on the addendum to the agenda document number well let me before I say that there are a number of plan commission items and as my staff has alerted your staff and the attorneys we're going to be hearing the plan commission items in the second half of our meeting uh let's Alderman Osterman you had me to the roll chairman yes sir all right so we're going to start today's meeting with the first item on the addendum to the agenda document number 02021-2990 the direct introduction to the committee uh an amendment of municipal code 16-6 by modifying various sections and adding new sections 16-6045 16-6055 and 16-6071 to the flood control ordinance all committee members should have received a copy of the ordinance last week and at this time I would like to take a motion to accept the direct introduction to the committee by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum any objections move to accept the direct introduction chairman makes that uh move any any objections no hearing none the direct introduction is before us and we have commissioner bode here to speak on the matter commissioner may you uh you there let's start

[Speaker 11] (25:15 - 27:10)
going okay so good morning chairman tony the honorable members of the committee on zoning landmarks and building standards my name is matt bode and i'm the commissioner of the department of buildings i'm here before you today to ask for your favorite consideration of an ordinance to amend the chicago flood control ordinance chapter 6 16 of the municipal code also with me here today is first deputy marlene hopkins and managing deputy commissioner grant alrick and uh marilyn succo of the illinois department of natural resources office of water resources first i apologize for the need to seek a direct instruction but time is of the essence and these amendments are necessary to reflect fema's designation of coastal hazards related to lake michigan that take effect on september 10 2021 and to ensure that the current and future flood insurance policies under the national flood insurance program the nfip are not adversely impacted i'm grateful to uh idnr and fema for working with the city on this matter and for idnr to be here with us today these amendments had definitions and technical standards related to coastal hazards which fema did not previously identify for cook county these technical amendments are necessary for property owners in the city of chicago to purchase or renew nfip policies after september 10 2021 there are approximately 1 000 policy chicago properties covered by nfip policies and i as chairman you said the committee has been given the the ordinance and the one pager on the program and the fema coastal flood review i thank you for your time and ask your consider considerable consideration on the ordinance the department and and nd and our representatives are here to are here and happy to answer any questions you may have thank you um well let me

[Speaker 1] (27:10 - 27:33)
start matt um just for the edification of the committee members the reason that this is a direct introduction is is what let's say it in so clearly the members know and you use the acronym nfi whatever but i'm sure that has to do with flood control stuff but would you give us the layman's

[Speaker 11] (27:33 - 28:30)
terms of what we're doing here so the nfip is a national flood insurance program so fema has been reviewing cook county for a while it's our turn in line along the great lakes and um you know the prior administration was what it was the current administration is um is being more diligent in working with us but unfortunately they do have these they do have this deadline that fema's imposed to september 10 2021 for these regulations to take effect and again if these regulations are not adopted by the city there is the potential for chicagoans both residents and businesses to to not be able to renew that flood insurance if it comes up on september the 10th so that's the reason for the direct introduction we're kind of under the gun by the federal government on this in the past they've been a little more lenient with us but um that was not the case this time around

[Speaker 1] (28:30 - 28:37)
all right we've got a few uh committee members we'll start with uh chairman wagasbeck scott

[Speaker 21] (28:38 - 29:23)
thanks uh commissioner boudet um thanks for that uh kind of layman's term look at this but when we're talking about a thousand people which areas specifically are we talking about where those people kind of pop up and is this just the great lakes or does it go further inland where we're talking about more flooding and possible future flooding this is great lakes related and these are properties that are located on lake michigan okay directly on the lake um uh as a side note this probably isn't for you maybe water department but are they also talking to you about expanding the look at um more throughout the city regionally what we're looking at for flooding

[Speaker 11] (29:23 - 29:35)
or not is that more in the water realm that may be more in the water realm of fema's um more of the at this point fema's looking at the great lake area okay sounds good thank you thank

[Speaker 1] (29:35 - 30:01)
you chairman uh let's see i am i not seeing other hands no all right any more questions from committee oh uh alderman beal tony thank you mr chairman somebody took my hand down i did i probably did that myself okay no i didn't you know better all right well somebody did it

[Speaker 43] (30:02 - 30:14)
i just proceed proceed all the one one quick question um who provides the insurance um or is this just something that um the federal government allows people to put a rider on

[Speaker 11] (30:14 - 30:44)
homeowners insurance this is a separate um insurance program by the federal government so it's the national flood insurance program uh you you can you you can use their program or you can use your own private program but this is a federal uh federally run program and there are a thousand homeowners or businesses that have policies directly in this federal program okay but they can also it could be spade farm it could be any but any other insurance company

[Speaker 43] (30:44 - 30:56)
okay now just question what happens if someone moves sells their property how do they get notified that there is a federal program available if they're in this flood zone area that would usually

[Speaker 11] (30:56 - 31:25)
be through their um through the real estate closing um having done several myself i know you you know the duties on the attorney to research a certain area so um you know if you're buying in a high flood area even if it's along the chicago river that's something that would be flagged during they should be flagged during the real estate closing they should should that's lawyers don't always do their job unfortunately but okay how can we assure that a person is protected or

[Speaker 43] (31:25 - 31:32)
at least notified that they have this option available to them that i'm not sure but it's

[Speaker 11] (31:32 - 31:39)
something we could obviously pursue as we look at more more disclosures okay i would you know i

[Speaker 43] (31:39 - 32:10)
would like to look into that yes if there's a way to make this you know somehow part of the closing and doesn't leave it up to an attorney because an attorney may miss this something like this yes you may they may miss it and you hear all the time people's houses get destroyed and you know they realize that they didn't have any insurance but if they didn't know that this was available to them so i think we need to make sure that we do a service to the people in that area that they get notified no matter what yeah absolutely thank you alderman thank you thank

[Speaker 1] (32:10 - 32:19)
you mr chairman thank you alderman baldeman uh thompson thank you uh chairman i know i'm not a

[Speaker 40] (32:19 - 32:45)
member of the committee but there's a matter up in my ward and i was listening as an attorney um maybe you can include something on the zoning cert uh or on the the water bill in the file that the city has you have you're required on the closing to obtain those and maybe there's something we put in there work with the zoning department anyway just a suggestion sure thank

[Speaker 1] (32:45 - 33:40)
you all thanks thank you very much any other uh questions by committee members or non-committee members all right can i get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was all the woman hadn't all the woman hadn't makes that motion any objections to her motion hearing none the item is passed all right thank you mr chairman thank you matt and and your team uh let's see next we have document number 02021-2875 for the the amendment of the municipal code chapter 6 table 14a through 12-1206.1 by implementing a cap on late payment fees of certain unpaid building inspection fees

[Speaker 11] (34:05 - 35:45)
and then we have document number 02021-2875 for the amendment of the municipal code chapter 6 table 14-1206.1 by implementing a cap on late payment fees of certain unpaid building inspection fees and then we have document number 02021-2875 for the amendment of the municipal code chapter 6 table 14-1206.1 by implementing a cap on late equitable barriers to renovation and developments that many members of the council have and i have discussed in prior conversations it's not uncommon for a property in your ward to be saddled by debt when a decade-old $50 building inspection fee has grown into a $650 debt and added on to that other inspections and you're looking at thousands of dollars proposed amendment will cap the total late payment penalty on unpaid building inspection and re-inspection fees at 100% of the original fee so again if you got a $50 inspection fee the penalty cap would be another $50 so you're looking at $100 not you know $600 or thousands of dollars this is similar to other fines for parking and camera enforcement tickets in the city capping these penalties is expected to reduce staff time spent on investigating increased collections and most important it will help decrease the cost of investment in areas of the city that have long been underserved the capital apply to late penalties on building inspection fees that are unpaid as of September 1st 2020 2021 late payment penalties will continue to accrue at the rate of five dollars per every 30 days this is in the ordinance but the cap it'll be kept again at the 100% of the original inspection fee the department will continue to work with the department of finance and collections and building inspection fees thank you for your time and ask for your favorable consideration on this ordinance the departments of buildings and finance are happy

[Speaker 1] (35:45 - 36:49)
to answer any questions you may have thank you mr chairman thank you commissioner any questions on this uh fee cap no hands up uh can i get a motion can i get a motion to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine form move to pass chairman alderman makes that motion any objections to the motion hearing no objection the item is passed all right chairman all right thank you next up is document number 02021-2442 the historical landmark designation for the former former schlitz brewery tide house at 1393 through 1399 west lake street uh we have candlin hon here from the historic preservation division of the department of planning and development to present this matter there you go thank you chairman tunney um hopefully you can

[Speaker 33] (44:18 - 45:14)
and thank you to the committee the proposed zoning change initiated with the 1900 south prairie driveway which is included in the boundary of the plan development the department of planning and development initially considered amending the pd boundary to remove the driveway which necessitated a plan commission action however after review the department recommended a better and more practical solution to remove the pd and return it to parks and open space pos zoning the pd includes the women's park and the field house which are both owned and operated by the chicago park district and removing the pd does not restrict anything the park district is doing or would be doing and it is the appropriate zoning classification it would fit under no changes in the existing park or the clark house which

[Speaker 1] (56:02 - 56:31)

[Speaker 6] (57:32 - 58:18)
offices of sam banks i'm here on behalf of the property owner michael marks the subject property at 2231 north cliborne is currently improved with a mixed use building containing one retail unit and one residential unit uh the owner of the building is proposing to convert the ground floor retail unit to a residential unit and in order to do that we're seeking a zoning change to establish the b2-2 zoning district um otherwise though the building the footprint will effectively remain the same it's an interior conversion of the first floor uh space we did meet with uh alderman hopkins and uh hosted a virtual community meeting i believe a letter of support is already on file um i'm not sure if uh the alderman would like to speak uh further all right i think alderman

[Speaker 46] (58:18 - 59:22)
hopkins is on the call brian uh yes uh this is to bring the structure into compliance with current practice i'll just point out that the commercial retail unit in question here is below grade that is generally considered one of the less desirable locations you have to kind of walk downstairs into a basement they attempted to find a retail tenant in today's environment that just didn't happen and i think it bears noting that when we we met with the community organization of record who is in the past they're generally skeptical of requests to convert possible retail use to residential but in this case they fully understood you know the existing conditions so it'll be good to get the lights back on in there with a residential use as opposed to you know keeping it vacant for years hoping that some magical retail tenant will appear which just doesn't seem to be the case so there's no opposition to doing this i support it and i would ask my colleagues for an aye vote thank you thank you brian any questions

[Speaker 1] (59:22 - 1:00:46)
for the applicant or the alderman hearing no questions can i get a motion moved to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum so moved alderman lopez alderman lopez makes that motion any objections to the motion hearing none the item is passed alderman lopez i know you're back we can we get through nix uh three other applications or do you want to be heard right now on your automatic i am nothing if not patient really i appreciate that it's gonna be a long day not just a comfy chair don't worry all right all right nick we're gonna we're gonna continue uh well let me see do we have anybody for ervin on this one um can you give your letter of support all right nick yes sir okay we're going to move to item number 20762 t1 28th ward ordinance was referred on june 23rd to 21 address common address 214 through 220 north holman and the change request rt4 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district the b33 community shopping district this is in the 28th ward nick uh first of all before you start do you have a letter of

[Speaker 1] (1:02:49 - 1:03:21)

[Speaker 21] (1:03:21 - 1:03:29)

[Speaker 1] (1:03:29 - 1:04:36)
consideration on this item okay thank you any questions for the alderman or the applicant hearing none get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum so moved alderwoman hadden alderwoman hadden uh makes the motion any objections to her motion hearing none the item is passed all right um while you're here i believe uh alderman ervin are you on the call yes i am all right jason um i'm gonna while you have nick fatigas here i'm going to we're going to go back to the application that's on holman which we just read into the record but i'll read it again it's document number 20762 t1 28th ward ordinance was referred on june 23rd of 21 common address is 214 through 220 north holman avenue and the change request rt4 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district the b33 community shopping

[Speaker 6] (1:04:36 - 1:05:51)
district all right nick thank you again chairman sunny nick fatigas from the law offices of sam banks i'm here on behalf of the uh the property owners in this case the uh zoning change would permit the re-establishment of commercial or retail uses on the first floor of the existing mixed-use building it's a two-story mixed-use building uh again with vacant retail on the first floor and a total of eight residential units above this is a transit serve location so there's no on-site parking um and again uh uniquely there was a former retail tenant um that was non-conforming more than 18 months have lapsed since the license uh active and for that reason we need the zoning change to re-establish commercial uses at grade again in this case the uh proposed retail tenant is uh breakthrough ministries which is a local non-for-profit organization um and they'll be the tenant for the entire first floor of the building and this is a t1 nick and there were no changes uh in this case uh chairman we did actually make a change to the narrative during our our initial submittal to the department of planning so i do have it marked as a substitute

[Speaker 1] (1:05:51 - 1:06:01)
narrative i would let me let me accept the substance let me get a motion to accept the substantive narrative and plans by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum

[Speaker 21] (1:06:02 - 1:06:09)
can i get a motion on that one please move to accept the substitute alderman wags back alderman

[Speaker 1] (1:06:09 - 1:06:26)
uh walks back moves to accept the subject narrative and plans by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum and there's any objection to that hearing none so now the substantive narrative are in front of us and correct me and the committee what was the nature

[Speaker 6] (1:06:26 - 1:06:40)
of the of the substitute it was in the just the language of the narrative description that's it there was no change to the building it's an existing building um and again an adaptive reuse of the existing first floor okay alderman ervin

[Speaker 44] (1:06:43 - 1:07:16)
thank you mr chairman uh we definitely we support this uh change number one uh breakthrough is putting the violence prevention component for east garfield park on the first floor of this building it was a store that gave us many problems glad to see that the owners have found a more suitable tenant for the location and uh this change would allow for them to occupy the first floor in its entirety they currently occupy one portion of the first floor but this now makes this a total commercial space and gets rid of a problematic uh corner convenience store that

[Speaker 1] (1:07:16 - 1:08:02)
existed in the community for years thank you alderman any questions from committee members hearing no question alderman pat dow moves uh do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum any objection to the motion thank you mr chairman hearing no objection this item is passed with the substantive narrative and plans now jason um while you're here uh we passed you over on the uh on the aldermanic let's go back to that and i think that's your is that your only item other than your aldermanic jason so we can get you out of here

[Speaker 12] (1:30:41 - 1:32:20)
um mark kupiak i'm the attorney for the applicant the applicant rosa and her husband they're the applicant and also the owners of the subject property and the subject property is improved with a one-story excuse me one-story fast food restaurant and actually rosa and her husband have owned the property for 20 years i haven't been able to trace the entire zoning history but i believe that the property was zoned business at the time this building was built because it's a one-story commercial building when rosa and her husband bought it about 20 years ago it the property had already been down zoned to residential however there was an ongoing business with a current license so they were able to get their business license and they operated their restaurant there for 18 years they closed down a couple of years ago and rented to a new tenant and most recently got another new tenant and when the new tenant went in for a business license was told that there had been a lapse in the license and that there's been no license there for more than 18 months and as a result they would have to rezone the property from residential back to business in order to get a new license for the existing for the restaurant in the existing building uh so rosa has actually been into the ward office a couple of times to explain her predicament to the alderman and ask for his support and i believe you have a letter of support uh sent to you by the alderman we do have a letter of support from alderman burke

[Speaker 1] (1:32:21 - 1:32:30)

[Speaker 12] (1:33:03 - 1:33:21)
going to become that's proposed in there yes uh bucio still on the property they have a new tenant and the zoning change would allow the new tenant to get a new license for the existing building similar to what they've done for the last 20 years uh well they decided they don't want to

[Speaker 1] (1:33:21 - 1:33:24)
get back into the restaurant business they'd rather lease it out it sounds like to me

the attorney for the applicant for this property 2029 west washington llc um and we're looking to rezone from r4 to an r4.5 um before we start one procedural matter the applicant did go through a community process at the request of the alderman he appeared before the homeowners of west town united to explain his project and actually the project is to give him extra floor areas so he could build a rear addition to the existing building and does have the support of the community the alderman did ask that he do this moving forward as a type one application just to memorialize the plans that were shown to the community group so procedurally i would like to revise our application amend our application to a type one application we did submit plans and a narrative to the zoning department in connection with this request

[Speaker 1] (1:38:04 - 1:38:22)
so if one of your committee members would be good enough all right so alderman dow moves to amend the application to a type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum any objections to her motion so hearing none the type one application is accepted

[Speaker 12] (1:38:23 - 1:39:09)
thank you and again the plans he showed to the community was for a three a third story rear addition to the existing three-story three flat building and actually the particular story was he's looking for the extra floor area to enlarge one of the units so that he could live in that particular unit and he did appear before homeowners of west town united to get their support and again also spoke with the alderman as a follow-up the alderman did request a type one and we do want to proceed with the type one and other than that i'm hopeful that alderman burnett is perhaps on the call to speak to his support alderman burnett yeah thank you mr chairman

[Speaker 10] (1:39:10 - 1:39:44)
as the councillor said he did meet with the local community organization in that area which is the homeowners of west town we did have a community meeting on via zoom in reference to this this uh proposal uh communities are excited to have a an addition on this building which some of it is going to be shared as some art space if i'm not mistaken so i asked that the committee support this my community support it i'll support it thank you thank you alderman any questions for

[Speaker 22] (2:12:58 - 2:13:22)
andrew scott thank you very much mr chairman members of the committee uh my name is andrew scott here on the off on behalf of the applicant our revival chicago llc uh mr chairman if i might before we proceed this matter was before the plan commission on july 15th i received a unanimous recommendation i would ask that the findings and proceedings from the plan commission be incorporated

[Speaker 1] (2:13:22 - 2:13:38)
the record today alderman uh riley moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum any objections hearing none the records

[Speaker 22] (2:13:38 - 2:14:46)
are incorporated uh continue thank you mr chairman uh this this project may seem familiar notwithstanding the brief description here it actually came before the committee uh mid-march of 2020 uh this is for a uh an 1800 uh approximately capacity live music venue a 4 000 square foot restaurant and 5 000 square foot brewery uh down in the bridgeport neighborhood um it was at our request held in committee uh because we were in the process of acquiring the property and our sellers didn't want us to rezone the property so it was held in committee and unfortunately based on the provisions of the zoning ordinance when the city council did not act on it due to covet uh within six months uh we needed a refile so this is the exact same application that was approved uh a little over 15 months ago and uh we would appreciate your your favorable consideration available to answer any questions i believe alderman thompson has communicated his support for the project and again we would appreciate your consideration

[Speaker 1] (2:14:47 - 2:15:50)
all right andrew let's hear from the alderman because i know the committee is very familiar with this project um and i know the alderman is very enthusiastically supportive so i think i'd like to know why we're back on this other than the covet issue because you know our committee has been meeting every month regardless so patrick well i mean chairman the short answer talking about you patrick talking about alderman patrick thompson i i thought he was on the call okay but we do have letter of support so patrick murphy now uh why don't you illuminate uh the uh this project that has been in front of our committee and well okay i what i was going to say initially is i mean i'm sorry plan commission right so what i was going to

[Speaker 29] (2:15:50 - 2:16:12)
initially say is the reason that it's back is because of a specific expiration clause that exists for six months between the time at which an application is forwarded from plan commission to having an action done by city council so that's a technical reason why it's back here again um as far as the uh the specifics of the project and the renovation and the rehabilitation i i would

[Speaker 1] (2:16:12 - 2:17:20)
defer to andrew to give if he wants to give a recap i'm not asking to rehash it because this also has been in front of finance committee if i'm not mistaken that is correct okay so we've seen this a lot and i think if members want to ask specifics about what this is a major uh renovation of an old theater on halsted that have been vacant for 30 years or something to my memory and and can i call lou right back okay so i i want to just what i do want to make sure is that that the zoning committee um and or and or the plan the plan commission did support it i know there was the finance committee supported a lot of it but at the end of the day why are we back with this with this six-month delay so okay so it's really a

[Speaker 29] (2:17:20 - 2:17:38)
two-part answer so technically the reason you're back is because of the delay i don't know what caused the delay for andrew's client so i i don't know why they could not proceed within the six months but the reason that they the reason that is back is because they did not proceed within the

[Speaker 1] (2:17:38 - 2:17:42)
okay well i just want to make sure that our committee

[Speaker 22] (2:17:43 - 2:18:53)
is not is never holding back anything no mr chairman you did everything that we asked you to do because when we came before the committee in march of 2020 we were under contract to purchase a number of pieces of property but none of our sellers wanted us to formally rezone the property until we had acquired it and so late february early march nobody ever thought you know what would come with the rest of the year would happen and so i had asked you to hold the matter in committee pending our acquisition of the property and then we were going to come back to your office and ask you to then report it out to uh to the full city council because of the pandemic the there was not a whole lot of appetite for 1800 live music venues breweries and restaurants and so the project was put on hold and then because of the extensive passage of time and we were not in a position to acquire the property by the time the six months had passed that uh patrick had referenced uh patrick murphy um it automatically expired and was deemed denied so it's not your

[Speaker 1] (2:18:53 - 2:19:11)
committee at all it's all it's yeah and i guess it's not you it's me i get the live venue and and the fact that they were mostly shut down for 18 months why financing might not be in order for such a large project so thank you uh with that i think uh alderman patrick thompson has his hand up

[Speaker 40] (2:19:11 - 2:20:09)
patrick thank you chair um i just wanted to again voice my support for this project this uh is a great project i uh appreciate tyler and his entire team uh committing and all of the landlords that are selling for their commitment to make this happen um as andrew said that uh it's completely his fault so we could blame him but it was uh really um the pandemic that caused everything to delay and toll for a year uh but they're here uh we're moving forward and and this will be a great catalyst not only for 35th and halsted for the bridgeport community but i think on the south side of chicago as well so i would respectfully request everyone to again support this you supported the past and let's get this across the finish line so thank you

[Speaker 1] (2:20:09 - 2:20:35)
thank you all right patrick i know how enthusiastic you are we can only control so many things um but i want to make sure that our committee was not holding up anything um that you so uh avidly support that's what i want to have on the record and absolutely yeah and finance is a whole different issue that's not that's a whole different committee so i just we're all good there so

[Speaker 40] (2:20:35 - 2:20:41)
you you've been very supportive thank you all right any other questions comments from committee

[Speaker 1] (2:20:41 - 2:21:00)
members hearing none can i get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum alderman hopkins moves to pass alderman hopkins makes the motion any objections to the motion hearing none the item is passed as revised thank you and uh one more matter

[Speaker 22] (2:21:00 - 2:21:22)
one more matter on this i'm going to make the same request that i did 15 months ago and i would ask that you hold this in committee we are supposed to close on all these properties at the end of this month but we have the same request from our sellers that we not rezone the property until we have closed on it so if you could hold it until further communications from my office that would

[Speaker 1] (2:21:22 - 2:21:39)
be very much appreciated all right we will we will not report it out thank you but this is the last time i hope so you tell those money people invest in the south as the mayor has said and

[Speaker 22] (2:21:39 - 2:21:42)

[Speaker 15] (2:28:54 - 2:32:20)
of the committee for the record my name is sarah barnes and i'm an attorney at the losses of sam bank located at 221 northwest dale street happy to be here today on behalf of the applicant gw um logan square llc um in an effort to preserve this very remarkable hollander storage building that is kind of a landmark of in and of itself within the logan square neighborhood um towards that end prior to appearing before you today we were here back in november of 2019 with a proposal to up zone the subject property to a c25 which was going to allow for the expansion of the existing five-story building that proposal called for a five-story lateral addition um the anchor tenant that was intended for that development was a large recreational sports facility and unfortunately due to covid that corporation actually shuttered during the pandemic and terminated their contract for the property thereby eliminating the viability for that project um as such we are here with a new development proposal that actually is just going to preserve the existing um hollander storage building and enhance it um through some design tweaks we are proposing an adaptive reuse for the building but no addition yep adaptive reuse of the building will allow for a daycare center to occupy the first floor there will be um office spaces cooperative office spaces located on the second and third floors and then um nine dwelling units above the offices are actually going to be reserved on a first come first serve basis for the residents of the building so that it will operate um the building itself will operate and function much like a live for a large live work establishment um we have been working very diligently with alderman lespada and the amazing residents of the neighborhood as well as the logan square preservation society um that's provided great feedback on the proposal um with that i too want to extend my gratitude to your staff mr chairman as well as the ms anna robles with the department of planning and development because we were working on this up until the 11th hour and i know there's a lot of confusion and communications back and forth um so with all of that this actually is not a type one zoning change because we are just simply reverting the prior type one zoning change that called for an up zone back down to the original underlying zoning designation so we're going from a c25 to a c22 um with that we do have the we're happy to report that we have the support of alderman lespada i believe that he tendered a copy of a letter um to your offices prior to this hearing and with no further ado i would be happy to answer any questions that any of the committee members may have okay all right so a

[Speaker 1] (2:32:20 - 2:32:29)
couple things um number one uh the department wants to know is the the curb cut being eliminated

[Speaker 15] (2:32:31 - 2:33:23)
so that's going to be a much larger adventure um with the department of transportation we um the alderman is would like to see it closed and we are supportive of that if we can gain access through the alley um the alley is traversed by the cta so we're also going to have to be working with the um cta and cdot on vehicular movements at and around the property so that's like i said kind of a larger undertaking and of course during our um ongoing deliberations with the department of transportation we will be keeping the department of planning and development apprised of our progress and i'm sure they'll be involved as well okay so stay tuned in short

[Speaker 1] (2:33:23 - 2:33:35)
as far as the zoning is concerned uh the alderman is supportive of the zoning and then the cdot issues will be separate in this thing all right it's the next thing you said the existing zoning

[Speaker 15] (2:33:36 - 2:33:45)
is a c25 oh i'm sorry excuse me i misspoke it's a c15 all right i'm sorry just double checking on

[Speaker 1] (2:33:45 - 2:34:51)
that thank you all right uh so with that uh questions comments as i said we do have a letter of support from alderman laspada on this project um no hands up can i get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum hello vice chair roboius makes the motion um any objections to his motion hearing on the item is passed all right so now before we we're going to the 44th ward right correct all right all right let me just get myself organized here so i can get off the let me read it in and then okay so we're part of everything okay so uh ariel will be on page two if you want to read it into the record um with the 32nd and 44th wards um aldermanic all right do it uh the item uh we're talking about a

[Speaker 27] (2:34:51 - 2:35:25)
dash eight six four one yep you got it okay in the 44th ward and in the 32nd wards uh to classify a segment of the west belmont avenue right away from the center line of north halsted street on the east and the center line of north southport avenue on the west as a pedestrian retail street we have uh alderman waggis back and alderman tunney here to speak on this matter let's start

[Speaker 21] (2:35:25 - 2:36:44)
with scott scott then yeah i'm here um so uh this is an interesting project we have a affordable housing building at belmont and racine and we initiated a review of this pedestrian proposal because the building that we wanted to add to um rehabbing existing 70 units and adding 35 units of permanent supportive housing put us in a spot where we couldn't use the adjacent parking lots working with planning and development they surveyed these blocks of belmont and determined that we could basically move ahead with this if we met the criteria of the pedestrian retail street here which this does so it started out with this one project that we were working on but then working together with the chairman we looked at the characteristics of this whole section of pedestrian streets and found that it fit into it so i think for um for all of us here that are working on this on this section it works out for us for future development and i would just ask for the committee's favorable uh support on this item okay

[Speaker 1] (2:36:46 - 2:37:22)
all of an attorney uh just want to uh support uh this designation um historically in the 44th ward belmont avenue had been a pedestrian street or continues to be one between halsted and racine uh in the the addition we'll now take it to southport so i am in support of it and uh for future land planning um you know it's the right way to it's the right way to address belmont avenue in this district so obviously i'm in support with alderman walks

[Speaker 27] (2:37:22 - 2:38:14)
back and hope the committee agrees with this designation okay there are no questions alderman hopkins makes a motion do pass by the same roll call used to determine quorum are there any objections hearing none the item is passed and then alderman if you want to move to the second item which is page 11 got it on page 11 yes uh next is file number 20759 dash t1 for the address commonly known as 3160 dash 3162 north broadway the change request is from a b3-2 community shopping district to a b3-3 community shopping district we have with us katrina mcguire to

[Speaker 36] (2:38:14 - 2:39:27)
present on this matter good afternoon mr chairman members of the committee again katrina mcguire from thompson coburn here on behalf of the applicant we are seeking to rezone the subject property to be 3-3 this is a transit served location and we are seeking to establish 17 dwelling units and six parking uh spaces here in a five-story building this is a project that we reviewed extensively with southeast lakeview neighbors the community group that has jurisdiction in that area as well as with our immediate neighbors to address their concerns and as a result of those meetings and conversations we did make some substantial changes to the project at the outset including the reduction of the unit count from 21 to 17 we set back the building the top story of the building both at the front as well as at the back set back the entirety of the building 30 feet off the property line to the rear and made some design and aesthetic changes as well although we did make changes to the project i just wanted to be clear on the record that all of those changes were made prior to filing so that there is no substitute or amended ordinance before you today um and with that um we're available for any questions you might have and i do believe

[Speaker 27] (2:39:27 - 2:39:39)
that we enjoy the support of alderman tunney for this project speaking of tunny uh alderman tunny would like to speak on this matter thank you uh vice chair and members of the committee

[Speaker 1] (2:39:39 - 2:40:26)
um as was stated by katrina uh a very extensive process was uh engaged with the community salvin immediate neighbors and the developer who's got a good track record in our neighborhood for for this actually this type of building i think we built something very similar to this on south court um and so um it beauty supported it um and i want to give thanks to my chief of staff for laboring many many hours with you katrina on this project um but i think it's going to be a a great uh addition to the street my only problem is what's going to be what two or three years in the future when they're actually when yes at this point existing leases it might be some time

[Speaker 7] (3:07:20 - 3:07:33)

[Speaker 7] (3:07:57 - 3:11:13)
the application seeks to establish a plan development to create bronzeville lakefront redevelopment of the 48.6 acre former michael reese hospital site which closed in 2008 the city acquired the property in 2009 in preparation for the failed 2016 olympics bid the site has remained vacant since the hospital closed the proposed pd includes a master plan and design guidelines intended to facilitate construction of approximately 7.9 million square feet of space a floor area 6 786 dwelling units and a variety of institutional residential and commercial uses to be developed in multiple sub areas grit has committed to achieving 30 minority business inclusion and 10 women owned business inclusion and striving to achieve 65 minority-led business participation the project will also promote business and employment opportunities including local small businesses in the new retail spaces and vocational training opportunities within the project itself bronzeville lakefront is designed to promote to provide numerous other public benefits including a bronzeville welcome center and community space educational funding and public open space bronzeville lakefront would be constructed in phases beginning with reconfiguring the internal campus style roadway network that served the hospital but isolated it from the community the new roadway network would connect the site to the broader bronzeville community and set the stage for development of institutional commercial and residential uses as well as open space and community uses that honor and celebrate bronzeville's history and community grit anticipates the first vertical project would be construction of a biomedical research facility reflecting bronzeville lakefront's focus on promoting health and wellness and equitable access concurrent with the project grit would construct a public park fronting on 31st street which would be deeded upon completion to the chicago park district grit would remain responsible for maintenance through edema a development easement and maintenance agreement is that acronym since being selected as developer through the city's competitive bid process grit has spent the last four years actively engaged with the bronzeville community including the michael reese advisory committee the develop the department of planning and development the department of transportation and alderman sophia king grit has conducted regular meetings with the advisory committee and its subgroups numerous community meetings town halls and presentations grit has worked in collaboration and partnership with the community as well as the city's departments of planning and development and transportation and other local and regional public agencies and stakeholders on behalf of grit i would like to thank alderman king the mayor's office departments of planning and development and transportation and the michael reese advisory committee for the collective work that shaped the pd being presented to you today i respectfully request this committee's recommendation that the application is substituted be approved and we are available for questions

[Speaker 1] (3:11:16 - 3:11:32)
all right um before we hear from the committee members and questions cindy from the department of planning do you want to chime in on behalf of the amount of work that your department has

[Speaker 14] (3:11:32 - 3:13:04)
put into this project thank you chairman tony yes it has been a lot of work and i especially want to thank alderman king and the volunteers of the members of the michael reese advisory council and the grit team we have as mariah explained been working for the past four years on this since the city issued the rfp in 2016 the grit team was selected in 2017 and we've been working hard on this project ever since especially the last couple of years and um you know this went to plan commission in february um and it was a very good meeting and this first uh tenant that we expect is the sheba medical center from israel um and we're very excited uh to um welcome them to chicago and this would be built in this first building the art innovation center and so um you know the grit team with their architect som and their landscape architect have been really showing us innovative designs as you can see in this image so we're very excited about this project and again want to thank everyone involved it's been a lot of city staff it's taken a whole village to get to this point so um it's it's been a lot of work but we're we're grateful for this opportunity to be in front of the committee on zoning building standards and limits today yeah all right

[Speaker 1] (3:13:04 - 3:13:32)
cindy you're too modest on this and i know we'll hear from the alder woman but being on plan commission um obviously this uh biomedical life sciences is going to be transformative my understanding though um they also have uh do they have a warehouse distribution part that's already been leased up on the north end of it and working they are working

[Speaker 14] (3:13:32 - 3:13:38)
with a data center tenant on the north end of the site as well and then uh the uh there is a

[Speaker 1] (3:13:38 - 3:13:43)
historical landmark part of this would you make sure uh yes the singer pavilion is the only

[Speaker 14] (3:13:43 - 3:14:13)
existing building left on the site since the michael reese hospital from the michael reese hospital campus um and that is uh while it is it's not a landmark building it is historically significant and the applicant uh as identified in the pd documentation is proposing to adaptive do an adaptive reuse of the building um and retain it so that's a very exciting piece and an important component uh for the project right and i i know that there's some flexibility

[Speaker 1] (3:14:13 - 3:14:28)
in the pd in regards to office and residential components but by and large outside of this life sciences uh what give us an idea what could be um on this fairly large site sure if mariah

[Speaker 14] (3:14:28 - 3:16:06)
could go back to the the plan that shows all the parcels that would be really helpful i think we want to show that so um one more um this one yes so subway one is highlighted in the darker orange color uh to the south of the site and so the arc innovation center with the sheba tenant would be on parcel 1b and then parcel 1a would be built as well and that's the open space uh that would then be conveyed to the park district upon completion um parcel 1i which is just west of there is proposed to be a senior housing and residential use um and then parcel 1c is where the singer pavilion will be and where the singer pavilion sits and that's going to be adaptively reused um and then um further north um parcel 2d that's the portion that is um proposed to be a future data center um that is also where the remediation work that the city is undertaking is happening in that section so uh and then parcel 3a as you know that is existing building uh for prairie shores um and then um the parcels uh between cottage grove and bernon 3c 1h 3b and 1i those are all identified for primarily residential use with some ground floor commercial space um so we would not have office use on those upper floors for those high rises

[Speaker 1] (3:16:06 - 3:16:28)
though and and and while it's not zoning obviously cdot's done a lot of work on connecting the grid back into the greater bronzeville community and um and then for the benefit to the east is the marshalling yards which is a it has nothing to do with this development

[Speaker 14] (3:16:29 - 3:17:27)
so um it's not part of the pd correctly currently but we the street grid was um designed to be forward thinking to in the future connect over the railroad tracks and into the marshalling yards uh site um if that is able to be developed which is our goal is to be able to redevelop that site if we can find a different um structured plan for the logistics facility for mpa so uh but yes absolutely uh the existing street grid is not uh connected and that is a problem uh for the redevelopment of the site and so we have absolutely worked uh with the department of transportation and the michael reese advisor council alderman king um and prairie shores as well because uh part of the roadway impacts their property um so all of those um elements have been coordinated um to be able to to provide that disconnection which helps alleviate traffic

[Speaker 1] (3:17:27 - 3:17:40)
issues in the area right um alderwoman king um i know you yeah an ordinary amount of time on this

[Speaker 8] (3:17:40 - 3:17:53)
and i know you have a lot to say about it so yeah i are are you guys taking questions do you want me to close after questions or do you want to hear uh you know whatever well i don't see hands up

[Speaker 1] (3:17:53 - 3:18:02)
okay i think uh there might be after you um after i after i go i think um chairman you know first of

[Speaker 8] (3:18:02 - 3:24:19)
all thank you uh for having me um here today uh to testify on this i i also vice chair roborious and and the rest of my colleagues i think um part of it is because you know this is uh one of several packages that we are trying to move forward in order to uh move forward bronzeville lakefront which everybody knows more as the michael reese development and so as you know we heard a piece of this in finance yesterday so my colleagues uh you know may have a good understanding of this uh development uh you know needless to say it's one of the larger developments in the city and will be very impactful uh to that end so first of all i i you know i'd like to just say thanks to uh cindy and dpd uh for all of their help uh throughout this process uh this is really just the beginning but uh as cindy indicated and others uh it's been a group effort um and so i just want to say thank you to her and the team at dpd including commissioner cox uh but be remiss if i didn't say something about tim jeffries noah francic and uh patrick murphy who was really very instrumental in helping me to understand planned developments i now know way too much about them but um he is uh you know does yeoman's work as you probably know chairman uh but i also want to extend my thanks to um the grit team uh you know we've had some let's just say a very meaningful conversation and i think this uh pd uh as well as the rda and the infrastructure agreement are better for it so uh it's really been a family effort but without the michael reese advisory uh council you know i would just say to my colleagues that if you don't have some entity like that in your ward that's helping make decisions then i would quickly do that but they have been very instrumental and i think the city would reaffirm that you know it's a very knowledgeable and passionate group of people who happen to live in the area some don't but most do um who have added a lot of insight but i'd love to ask for my colleagues favorable consideration for a number of the reasons that were indicated during uh the presentation but also because this will be um a sustainable development including residential retail commercial space um that's going to impact the entire city um probably the world honestly um and um provide you know just a lot of economic stimulus uh not to mention taking you know vacant land off the tax rolls and adding probably billions of dollars to it long term but also jobs uh good jobs especially thankful to my partners in labor uh unite here um uh for fighting along with us for making sure that in the long term uh that the hospitality industry has uh good paying jobs um and so uh but throughout uh the development there'll be you know great jobs long term including construction short term and long term and so um it's really a great development along with the community benefits that you've heard about uh but i'd just like to mention you know a few of them uh you know the in the um first phase of development in the arc uh building um there will also be a community center slash digital museum we haven't you know yet named it uh but you know the development team has made a large commitment to that um so we're thankful for that but we're also thankful that it will be kind of the gateway to the community um and so a very vibrant building we hope to establish there uh that pays homage to uh the bronzeville community to michael reese um and all of the historic uh significant um things that they have provided to not only the city but to the world when we think about all the people all the legacy uh that's there um also uh you know we the team has made a commitment to education a 25 million dollar commitment um hopefully that will be spurred quickly by the um the building of a digital um center north on the um north on the property as cindy indicated uh but i'd also like to add that you know uh to help sustain the community center because that's generally a problem for nonprofits uh there will be an impact fee that um all the tenants uh in the arc center will pay uh towards uh the operating costs for uh the community center and then of course you know mbe wbe requirements as well as um a commitment to diversity that goes beyond those uh normal goals internships apprenticeships affordable housing 20 on site um as cindy mentioned a senior building in the first phase um you know right down for the commercial space that's there they're going to have 10 of the commercial space uh written down by by 20 um so that will help local businesses um and attract local businesses there um and so just a lot of benefits uh for the community and so i am proud to um stand here today sit here today be here today uh to advocate on behalf of this development and this pd and ask for the favorable

[Speaker 1] (3:24:19 - 3:24:25)
consideration of my colleagues yes thank you all the woman um we've got a couple hands up um we'll

[Speaker 1] (4:19:29 - 4:19:57)
concerning the project all right obviously this uh project is innovative and got a lot of attention after a post plan commission um questions comments so so jack i'm you know i'm i'm doing the math here the initial investment is 30 million the initial that's correct chairman and then up to 15 million

[Speaker 2] (4:19:57 - 4:20:02)
on an annual basis yeah they do they put in 15 to 20 million each year each year because they

[Speaker 1] (4:20:02 - 4:20:08)
change the spectacle you know the first year it's a spectacle all right but my question is

[Speaker 2] (4:20:08 - 4:20:46)
my staff saying well how can i afford it well i think that while it's being run through uh so that people can't afford it and then they have in addition to that they have a program for making sure that the students from public schools and the rest of it can see this at at either free or reduced prices and so uh the the cost of admission to this will be comparable with most any other entertainment venue in the city but they do have special programs for the children in the city of chicago and different neighborhood groups that will want to come and see these different types of spectacles that will be at this site well i'm glad we brought that

[Speaker 1] (4:20:46 - 4:20:56)
up because it looks like it could be cost prohibitive for a lot of chicago residents so never mind the parking costs in navy pier but that's another issue

[Speaker 2] (4:20:57 - 4:21:08)
i they'll bring the school buses i hope so we think it'll be really attractive to school kids and i think that they'll all be able to afford it mr chairman thank you very much other questions

taxes will be 1.2 to 1.4 annually in real estate taxes we went through and since this is also a lakefront protection application there are 14 policies that you have to look at and be guided by and and

city of chicago all those requirements the next slide please yeah this just shows that we have there'll be 11 aro units on the site and we are complying with the aro requirements the next slide please these are the ones that i just talked about so i think that i think that pretty much covers it mr chairman and members of the committee we stand ready to answer any questions that any of you might have concerning the project i know that alderman capelman i'd like to thank him for all the time and effort that he put in on this matter uh over the time over the length of period of time that this project has been heard by the different community groups but we stand ready to answer any questions that you might have mr chairman or any members of your committee thank you mr george um alderman

[Speaker 3] (4:32:21 - 4:32:55)
capelman thank you chairman tunney um jack george is right there's been countless community meetings i it's unusually high but it was unusually high because of the adjoining properties of 36 36 north lakeshore drive and 3600 but that feedback paid off and the input from east lake u neighbors was also great that's which made it fairly easy when it finally came to the 46 ward zoning development committee to pass it so with that i ask my colleagues to support this project

[Speaker 1] (4:32:55 - 4:33:16)
thank you all right questions um and comments um just a comment i'm i'm very familiar with this project and also the history of this project mr george um or alderman capelman when was

[Speaker 3] (4:33:16 - 4:33:25)
the first tower actually completed i believe i had i was rather new i remember it being

[Speaker 1] (4:33:25 - 4:35:34)
built i think around 1988 right right and at that point there were supposed to be two twin towers yes um that was to be developed and it stood uh obviously that building was designed to accommodate that second tower the way it was uh set back in design uh but obviously that's not what transpired here and uh it's a it's a smaller smaller project um but um this this piece of property had been negotiated probably over 30 or 40 years um we're done with it if we if we pass this we're done with this with this parcel so um i know a lot of uh years of development ideas on this really happened so i applaud you working with a lot of competing interests on this one so any other questions or comments um okay got a motion to move to pass on this item by the by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum uh alderman i think maria hadn't uh moved it uh any objections to our motion hearing none uh this item is passed as revised and substituted all right thank you all right members of the committee all right uh we have one more item in the 46th ward uh that if you recall we had a number of our public speakers that were not in support of it uh and then and after that we're going to go back to all the vice chair roboius because we're going to uh an item that he deferred um so i see alderman alderman hadn's hands up

[Speaker 4] (4:35:35 - 4:35:42)
just getting in queue for questions on the next item chair okay all right uh so you know what i'm

[Speaker 1] (4:35:42 - 4:36:12)
gonna do i'm gonna go i'm gonna i'm gonna move uh to the roboius item first i think it's pretty non-controversial and then we'll hold the best for the last all right that would be a maria hadn't all right so we're going to go let me go back to my paperwork all right so uh vice chair roboius it's my understanding that a matter was deferred in your ward that you are ready to proceed on

[Speaker 27] (4:36:12 - 4:36:29)
do you have a motion you would like to make that is that's correct mr chairman i'd like to make a motion to reconsider uh the motion to defer item number 20683-t1 for the address known as 4730

[Speaker 1] (4:36:30 - 4:37:11)
west grace all right any objections uh to that motion all right hearing none um we're going to be the item is being reconsidered and i'll now read it again into the record and that would be on page 12 the bottom number 20683-t1 30th ward ordinance was referred on april 21st of 21 the common address is 4730 west grace street and the change request rs3 residential single unit detached house district to an rt 3.5 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit

[Speaker 47] (4:37:12 - 4:38:07)
uh dan lauer um are you on the call and yes mr chairman i am uh thank you for recalling it and uh this uh this app this uh file has not uh been on the front page of create chicago business like the last several but it's still very important so thank you once again for recalling it um it's 20683-t1 4730 west grace i represent g7 investments it's a really big lot 37 and a half by 123 but it's only got a legal two flat there and the current rs3 is not enough to allow uh the third unit i've been in the third unit it's got a nine foot ceiling maybe nine and a half and um with um alderman uh vice chairman uh robo iris's assistance uh we're able to um to legalize uh all this application is just to legalize the third dwelling unit at the property

[Speaker 27] (4:38:07 - 4:38:39)
and we certainly thank the vice chairman and the staff alderman robo is uh this item yeah thank you uh uh mr chairman and as uh attorney lauer just stated we we did uh move on this matter because it's an existing uh basement and we're just uh uh correcting the zoning matter on the building that's all it is thank you i asked for your favorite uh favorable uh decision on this

[Speaker 1] (4:38:39 - 4:39:42)
matter before you great any questions uh from committee members on this item hearing on alderman cardona moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum any objections to his motion hearing on the items passed all right now we're going back to the 46th ward i'll read this into the record and this is document number 20698 46th ward ordinance was referred on may 26th of 2021 yeah common address 4600 north marine drive change request residential institutional plan development number 37 to residential institutional plan development number 37 as amended uh paul shadel is the attorney on this and as i said earlier this was uh we had some uh three i three or so comments um in uh opposing this one in the public commentary

[Speaker 19] (4:39:44 - 4:40:07)
good afternoon mr chairman uh paul shadel with the law firm of dla piper along with my colleague katie janky dale representing lincoln property company national llc the applicant in this matter also with us today are jose joviano from the applicant and bob weber our architect this matter was heard by the plan commission on july 15th and i would ask that the record of that

[Speaker 1] (4:40:07 - 4:40:22)
proceeding be incorporated into this proceeding so vice chair roboius moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum any objections no moment hearing none uh the records are incorporated and we can

[Speaker 19] (4:40:23 - 4:43:03)
continue on thank you mr chairman uh as you see on your screen now the site is located at the northwest corner of wilson and marine drive the image before you shows the proposed building which would sit on what is now a surface parking lot the request is to amend the pd to permit the improvement with this building which would contain 314 dwelling units the of those dwelling units eight on site would be affordable uh to residents eligible incomes at or below 60 of ami also as part of the affordable requirements ordinance uh compliance the applicant would donate uh just a little bit more than three million dollars to a fund that would support the development by sarah's circle of a project also in the 46th ward that would serve residents eligible at or below 30 of the area median income the in lieu fee for that is intended to support approximately 23 additional units uh next slide please the building that you see is the result of a long process led by alderman capelman and the department of planning and development uh lincoln began that process in january of 2020 had extensive meetings with again the department of planning and development and also through alderman capelman with both the zoning and development committee of the 46th ward uptown united and other groups in the 46th ward the building was fairly substantially revised based on those meetings the elevation that you see before you is the east elevation that elevation in particular and then if you could go to the next slide the south elevation which fronts on wilson also was changed in order to enhance materials add more glazing and and make other changes to to have the building integrate more directly with the street this project is expected to generate fairly substantial public benefits it's about an 80 million dollar capital investment approximately a thousand construction jobs substantial additional property tax revenue in keeping with the mayor's executive order the developer will seek to include 26 mbe and 6 wbe on the project and 50 city resident hiring um we'd like to thank alderman capelman the departments of planning and development c dot and the department of housing for this innovative aro compliance structure and as i noted we have others oh and also michael berkshire and others in the department of planning and development staff for working with us in this process as i noted at the beginning we have others from our team available to answer questions and would respectfully request this committee's

[Speaker 1] (4:43:03 - 4:43:22)
positive recommendation to the full council right okay uh i think alderman capelman would you like to hear questions first or do you want to speak now you can always close i can speak now okay uh

[Speaker 3] (4:43:22 - 4:49:44)
thank you chairman tunney i you know i i've heard many times over at this meeting and other meetings about uh people's concerns about displacement and and to be honest you know the concerns about displacement they're occurring across this country and and you know it's happening here in uptown which is one of the most diverse communities in the city and and for that reason residents are rightly focused on protecting it i started here as a social worker in uptown 33 years ago where i i first helped settle refugees into the area and i later worked as a case manager where i had a caseload of people living with hiv many of whom were also diagnosed with a mental illness and they were living in the streets uptown has a long history of having some of the highest rates of subsidized housing in the city in addition around 50 percent of our housing is naturally occurring affordable housing and that is defined as market rate housing for people who earn around 60 percent of the ami or less we also have seven homeless shelters within five blocks of this site these shelter residents are are individuals who are in desperate straits for affordable housing set for people earning 15 of the ami i say 15 because many of them are in ssi supplemental security income and their their income is 792 a month these are individuals who would never qualify for on-site affordable housing because it's set at 60 percent in recent years uptown has become a victim of its own success three and a half years ago a 203 million makeover of the wilson cga station was completed in the last five years a violent crime in the area has dropped to an all-time low it's the lowest we've ever seen since we've started recording violent crime in the city and those two factors have made the uptown community a much more attractive a place for people to live commissioner navarro told me earlier this week actually last week that she spoke with someone who was quite concerned about gentrification in uptown and she told this person not building more affordable housing not excuse me not building more housing will not stop people from moving into the area my concern is that if we don't build more developers will go after our naturally occurring affordable housing and upgrade that and that is the issue it's by building more housing that we're able to help protect our naturally occurring affordable housing with regards to the aro for this project i worked with the department of housing to do something a bit unusual one quarter of the 10 affordable housing is on site for people earning 60 the ami and the remaining requirement will go to sarah circle to build 100 affordable housing apartment building that will be constructed about two blocks away so this three million dollar plus in lieu fee will complete the financing needed to fully fund their project looking at all the different options the department of housing provided a letter of support for fulfilling the aro in this manner in their letter of support it was stated quote contributing the aro obligations directly to an approved affordable development like sarah circle enables the affordable development to be built quicker provide surety of their financing and may reduce routine compliance related costs for the affordable owner now many of us in city council we don't like the off-site affordable housing option because we can't guarantee the in lieu fee will build housing in our wards however this in lieu option provides housing within my ward but rather than have it focus on people earning 60 of the ami it will go to women who earn 15 or less of the ami these are individuals who would never qualify for on-site housing because they earn too little they are the ones who are most at risk for living on the streets there have been some fears expressed that allowing weiss memorial hospital to sell an asphalt parking lot that's no longer needed will spur the sale of the entire hospital i get it i really get it about the lack of trust for pipeline which owns hospital however pipeline has invested so far around 40 million dollars into upgrading this hospital and they have pledged to use the entire proceeds of the sale of the parking lot into the hospital's programming which includes a gender confirmation program for the trans community and as a former social worker in the hospital who worked in the hospitals 20 years in the hospitals that's very very difficult to come by they also provide health care to many of our area families and seniors who rely on medicaid so you don't invest this amount of money into a hospital if you have plans to turn around and sell it nevertheless if pipeline made the decision to sell this hospital it sits on a planned development site that requires medical use so unlike west lake that pipeline sold having weiss on a planned development site provides the needed safeguards to keep it as a facility that provides medical care for our local community so you know with that i ask my colleagues to support this project and vote and vote in favor of this proposal and also like to hear any questions oh all right we've got a couple hands up

[Speaker 1] (4:49:45 - 4:49:53)
um we'll start uh the with uh alderman hannon great thank you chair um and thanks alderman

[Speaker 4] (4:49:53 - 4:50:21)
capelman for for kind of the the intro there um a couple questions for i guess lincoln property company representatives um and the attorney um could you uh share again and i'm sorry if i miss this um could you share again some information about the i guess your target audience for your tenants um what's the unit mix going to look like um who's this building for yes i would ask

[Speaker 19] (4:50:21 - 4:50:27)
joe segobiano from lincoln to address that and please identify yourself for the record joe

[Speaker 23] (4:50:33 - 4:51:43)
good afternoon everyone my name is joe segobiano with lincoln property company um to answer your question uh committee member right now we are looking at about 86 studios 164 one unit um and then 56 two-bedroom units in addition to that we would have the affordables as two studios for one bedrooms and two two-bedroom units so the mix is about 27 studios 52 two bedrooms and 17 almost 18 two bedrooms 52 one bedroom and could you tell me the average number i guess of your one bedroom sure of course um the average square foot on a one bedroom is about 700 square feet and then the average square foot on a two bedroom is about 1100 square feet and your studios studios are 472 square feet these are not micro units these are all market rate sizes they are not micro units um so that was a conscious decision that we made going into the

[Speaker 4] (4:51:43 - 4:52:26)
early design phase of the project gotcha still a lot of a lot of studios in one bedroom so not really necessarily geared towards families or kind of multi-generational households i guess there um uh and then i guess maybe this this question there's in the community comments and of the um written comments we received um for lincoln properties there were some talk of lawsuits uh some class action suits some discrimination suits i'm wondering if you guys could address those concerns um about you as a company sure um actually i have a prepared

[Speaker 23] (4:52:26 - 4:53:33)
statement on that i'd like to read uh lincoln property company is a national company that prides itself on diversity among the employees as well as within our communities we have approximately 5 000 employees and approximately 700 communities around the country um we self-manage our pride our communities and we own our communities long term and therefore we're committed to being a part of the neighborhood and contribute to the current diversity as well as the long-term viability and success of the neighborhood we typically implement programs to interact with our neighborhood like hosting local businesses or supporting supporting local endeavors um such as sarah circle or public art or things of that sort um i am not aware of any current uh lawsuits i know that i am in in charge of the midwest development here and we have approximately 39 communities in chicagoland 23 in the city of chicago and we do not have any uh lawsuits with regard to discrimination in any of those communities okay thank you thank you for

[Speaker 4] (4:53:33 - 4:55:31)
answering that question um i appreciate that um uh i guess another question i mean i alderman capelman i know you kind of addressed and tried to reassure us around pipeline i do want to say as the alderman of the 49th and a resident of rogers park um this is this is kind of the closest hospital that we have that's in chicago um so my residents uh use use uh use the hospital um it's i i hear your comments about hey why would they invest money if they plan to close it uh their their track record with westlake gives me a lot of pause um especially in the way that they closed it uh i believe was through bankruptcy so i could see someone investing money um in a venture that they really know isn't going to pay off and so looking at this loss of property um as part of the hospital campus even if you you're saying it's underutilized if pipelines like selling off this and using it to invest but i look at that that aerial photo and we should be investing in our medical systems we should be investing in growing them and it's very concerning to me um about and i don't think anyone from pipelines here because know they're they're not uh on the table here for this development but looking at the space we're losing um how will this hospital grow to accommodate people um how are we increasing our medical infrastructure um and i just see a loss of land here and what i already know is a very compact and dense space and it literally is leaving like no room for growth especially when we talk about the planned development for medical use um so i have some big concerns there as to the proposed future um and how shaky it is in in working with this particular operator um i can answer that

[Speaker 3] (4:55:31 - 4:56:14)
question if you'd like sure um if you look at the drawing there's a office up medical offices just north of the hospital proper itself uh in the 10 years i've been uh alder person in the 46 ward those medical offices have been between 50 and 80 vacant um and they are still i think it's over 50 vacancy rate in the medical offices and so weiss has hopes and they're working on plans to filling up those office spaces but it's it's still a long ways to go before that can happen so that's where the expansion can happen and it's needed and i would just note alderman hadden uh

[Speaker 19] (4:56:14 - 4:56:29)
that the the planned development also allows substantial additional floor area for hospital use should that be available you know possible in the future they'd have to come in and get approvals from you for the actual physical improvements but there is floor area available

[Speaker 4] (4:56:29 - 4:57:00)
for hospital use um so then uh last question for me um i i'm wondering i don't know if we've got anybody here from the city to speak or alderman capelman maybe this is for you um but you know residents were really raising concerns about the location of the backup generators for the entire north side um some of our generators that are located kind of um at the space and some concerns about um how these will be impacted with the construction just wondering if somebody could

[Speaker 3] (4:57:01 - 4:57:38)
expound on that i know that right directly west of it is lakeview towers um it's it's our largest not-for-profit affordable housing in the 46th ward and having that location there we've never experienced any issues before um uh in in all the discussions that we've had with the city and department of planning development department of housing um that concern never came up

[Speaker 4] (4:57:43 - 4:57:49)
um all right um i think those are my questions for now um i still have a lot of concerns about

[Speaker 1] (4:57:49 - 4:57:56)
this project all right thank you all the women um alderman sicho lopez

[Speaker 5] (4:57:57 - 5:00:24)
thank you um thank you chairman um and um we'd like to add to some of the concerns that other women hadn't had in um in this particular project i i hope everybody in the county in the committee was able to to get the letters you know of course it's important to hear directly from the constituents um some of the concerns that i have um have to do with um you know the community's perspective on this and i want to quote one of the senators there's at least two senators who have sent letters of opposition uh senator sarah fingers quotes um uh it states the following and i do think that this is important um and i'd like to maybe see if alderman capelman can respond to this um since november 2019 i have heard from various community stakeholders and residents who reside close to the proposed development most of whom have demonstrated their opposition to the current proposal although i believe that the alderman has good intentions i struggle with the prospect of only 300 studio units with only two percent on-site affordability then of course he mentions the rental ranges from 1300 to 1600 making them unaffordable to many community members who have called this area home for decades my question to alderman capelman is and again we have seen in front of our community and our committee many projects that come in front of us uh i really commend alderman king for taking her time i know she's had a lot of pressure to uh press forward with her proposal and bronzeville in a big proposal um my concern and my question is why it is the rush it seems like again from a senator's perspective there seems to be a lot of sentiment and i think this seems like there's a majority of the community who have serious concerns uh what is the rush and can we i mean i will say that it'll be important for for these issues and local officials to work together to address the current concerns so that we can provide the benefits that the community needs so that's my question and i'm sorry i was a little long i want to make sure that i'm factual and i state some of the um some of the reasons why

[Speaker 3] (5:00:24 - 5:02:56)
some local officials are opposing this thank you i'd like to address that um uh state senator feigenholz um was incorrect about the makeup of the amount of housing it's it's not 300 units of studios um and the developer already talked about that mix of two bedrooms actually the majority one bedroom and some studios that currently exist there and there in her letter she also talked about a state law that would encourage um uh the uh the aro to happen on site which which is a laudable thing to happen um my concern has always been though that um uh the residents who are most at risk for living on the streets earn 15 percent of the area median income so even with the state law that's been recently passed it would not help them i i need help for women who are living on the streets and this particular um aro the way it's laid out at the uh at the um support of the department of housing allows us to build 28 units of affordable housing for women who would otherwise be living on the streets as far as the support of the community i have a 35 member zoning and development committee it is made up of organizations spread throughout the ward and areas of greater density have more representation because 25 of the area residents have low income 25 of the members of the zoning committee uh represent uh that group there was a vote and it was very very close it was 16 in favor 15 opposed but just like every alderman does across the city i'm no different uh the vote of this committee is advisory only um if i strictly go with what the committee wants then i would support the vote of the four six words only development committee which voted in favor and supported this project

[Speaker 5] (5:02:58 - 5:04:34)
yeah an alderman uh kapelman again i think my my concern again goes that it seems like you said even in your own committee you have a very split decision you have at least two senators who are expressing serious concerns about the implications other women had mentioned around um the questioning around uh pipeline health that is still um you know the track record doesn't really reassure uh some of the commitments that even have maybe done in other parts of the county and the so my question again is will this be something that you can um reconvene i think that it seems like having more time uh perhaps can um help the community and your own committee to address some of the concerns as we have seen and again i will want to point out to all the women king's um proposal having a little bit extra time certainly has shaped i mean i think we're all uh commending her efforts and i think we have more community benefits i i just still don't know what what is the rush will this something that you can perhaps take a little bit more time i do think luxury condos can wait but having making mistakes when it comes to public health when it comes to um residents who are in dire need i do think that will be a detriment uh to the whole community and the whole city so will there be something that you can consider and give give the community a little bit more time so that you can discuss this properly i think that you have some serious concerns including from local officials so with all due respect this is not a condominium these

[Speaker 3] (5:04:34 - 5:06:21)
are apartments and um i i know that uh state senator feigenholz meant well but she had the facts wrong about the 300 units of of uh studio apartments and she uh also is focusing on uh families and individuals earning 60 she did not address the need that i see in this community and that is the need for housing for people earning 15 or less of the area median income in my discussions with state senator mike simmons he addressed the concerns that this would cause gentrification and i pointed him to a number of different studies that show that not building more housing will not stop gentrification the way to address gentrification is to build more housing because that stabilizes rents and that's what we need is a stabilization of rents and if we do not build more of this type of housing then developers will go after our naturally occurring affordable housing as they already have that's why i lost the chateau that's how i lost the norman that's how i lost the darlington that's how i lost the lawrence house that's how i lost the hazleton i want to put a stop to that i want housing more housing so that developers don't go after our naturally occurring affordable housing that's what's keeping our residents many who've been living here for generations that's what's keeping them here and all right let me interrupt for a second

[Speaker 1] (5:06:21 - 5:08:10)
there's a couple things i want to say number one is that the rules committee will will meet uh directly after the zoning meeting and then the next thing before i ask uh cjo to continue is there are many different committees in city council some are finance some are development some are housing this is the zoning committee and you know there's all sorts of battles about about affordability and some other issues i i would like to stay as close to the zoning on this parcel and and try to keep it focused on the ability for them to change the zoning as alderman capelman says this the trust factor with the hospital maybe this development will keep them running for the north side for many many years but this is all part of a plan development that we're releasing this one this one parcel but i think it's ordered to to sustain i believe and i trust and i know this came up in plan commission quite a bit um that they will be valued valued health partners for many years whether or not you can trust that that's a whole different issue but i i would like to make sure that um that we try to make sure that that we respect the development and the zoning process and then issues about affordability and some other things um you know yes they're part of zoning but i think that they're they're well discussed in some other aspects of our city council so with that um chairman byron or hold on a second i want to do byron you want to finish your thoughts or questions thank you chairman and

[Speaker 5] (5:08:10 - 5:10:07)
i i'll uh um yeah i'll i'll keep it brief uh and i i appreciate that i think let's focus on the zoning aspect of it and that's what i um i'm urging alderman capelman uh just knowing and the facts are there i think the fact of the matter remains is a very um contested issue in the community i do think that we ought especially we did these very trying times to make zoning decisions that do not negatively impact uh the well-being of the entire community that's what i um i wanted to ask if he would consider having more time so that he can address some of the concerns the last thing i like to say just in terms of questions uh and i do challenge some of the decisions in the planning commission as well as some of the arguments that were made in terms of zoning uh the supply side of economics is a highly subjective matter uh supply side economics meaning uh if we build more housing supply will meet the demand we have seen how supply side of economics have unfortunately uh being proven wrong in multiple locations we have a lot of vacant luxury housing and what we do need is also making sure that we have um public services like public health especially now so my last question and again in order to protect naturally occurring affordable housing is to protect uh or or homeowners or small homeowners to protect the social fabric or communities by taking the time to listen to those who are affected we know that we have a broken property tax assessment system we do know that there's many variables i contest that's the notion of supply side economics that we just need to build more and we're going to address some of the issues that is incorrect it is not based on any facts there may be a study but i tell you that what we do need is to build affordable housing on site that's proven to work and also more than anything else listen to our constituents i would like to

[Speaker 21] (5:10:07 - 5:10:14)
just chairman point of information i don't i know we're repeating the same thing here but

[Speaker 41] (5:10:14 - 5:10:20)
there is no question that alderman capelman did not listen to his constituents i i i just

[Speaker 5] (5:10:20 - 5:10:37)
stick to the facts of zoning all right oh all right so i was i was responding to an argument making sure that we're taking the time to have a conversation right i understand that some rubber roberstam alderman can do whatever they want but here in the council we can have a chairman

[Speaker 1] (5:10:38 - 5:11:12)
all right so with that with that uh alderman um alderman capelman i believe as he stated has had a robust process uh like we all ask each other to respect the communities that we represent and i know he does a good job doing that um there's disagreements uh but i think uh points have been set on both sides and i'm going to ask to move to alderman rodriguez thank you chair

[Speaker 31] (5:11:12 - 5:11:39)
and uh forgive me i'm uh seeing myself right here uh just quick questions i like my colleagues uh would like to get on to the next couple of committees so i'll be quick quick forgive me i'm wondering if the zoning administrator or someone from the city could respond to the following question around the pending changes in aero and if that would have an impact on this project if it were to be delayed several months good question all right

[Speaker 1] (5:11:39 - 5:12:07)
patrick murphy or somebody from planning please hello i don't know patrick patrick murphy or steve sorry sir yeah oh there he is all right that

[Speaker 32] (5:12:07 - 5:12:12)

[Speaker 29] (5:12:12 - 5:12:24)

[Speaker 31] (5:12:24 - 5:12:35)
mike re michael repeat the question please sure thanks tom uh patrick just wondering if there would be any change uh any impacts on the change in the pending change in the aero if this project

[Speaker 29] (5:12:35 - 5:12:59)
were to be delayed several months oh oh so um you mean if it gets delayed beyond the october 1st of the aero exactly well that would i don't know all the specific aero requirements under this project but yes the way it's written now if it's if there is an aero impact and it's moved to after

[Speaker 31] (5:12:59 - 5:13:30)
october 1st then the new aero would apply okay thanks patrick um all right wouldn't know the the actual impacts on this project then i don't know off the top my head but i will i will figure it out and get back on here yeah i that that would be good to know and then uh just uh just another question uh i'm not sure who this would be for but it uh maybe for the developer was there a traffic study done or and and or an environmental uh impact study done in this project alderman

[Speaker 19] (5:13:30 - 5:13:56)
rodriguez i can address that paul shadel again with dla piper yes there was a traffic study done by kloa it was vetted by the department of transportation and the department of transportation approved this plan okay anything on the environmental impacts uh as far as uh there was a you know they would do a typical phase one to confirm that they can buy the property in terms of sustainability environmental sustainability the project will comply fully

[Speaker 3] (5:13:56 - 5:14:31)
with the city's sustainability policy okay that's all i have thank you all right um chairman tony alderman capperman i just want to say that um the affordable ordinance the affordable requirements ordinance that was passed to revise it um my suggestion is if we're going to apply this ordinance it needs to be applied equitably across the city we cannot pick and choose which developments need to um be reviewed after the new aero comes in existence and and not do that to

[Speaker 1] (5:14:31 - 5:14:46)
all the other projects all right thank you all right i did see alderman haddon's hand up again you want to ask a question or two more marie thank you chairman i appreciate it um thanks for your

[Speaker 4] (5:14:46 - 5:15:24)
patience colleagues um i actually i i know we're talking about the zoning i had one more question that was a follow-up um for for joe and this was alderman capelman this was you mentioned that uptown's become a what was this victim of its own success um as a neighboring neighborhood that also historically thrives with affordable housing but is seeing different changes um i have a lot of questions about how our zoning decisions impact that and affordability and so i'm wondering joe what are the proposed rents for these for these places given that we're not putting a lot of

[Speaker 23] (5:15:24 - 5:16:12)
affordable on site um how much are you charging sure um be happy to address that our rents are $1,600 for a studio for the market about $898 for an affordable unit for one bedroom there at about $2,200 for the market rate $951 for an affordable and for a two-bedroom there about $2,900 for a market rate and $1,100 for an affordable i would also like to add that based on the current statistics about 50 of the current residents would qualify to live in this building qualifications would be 32 grand on an affordable unit and 62 grand

[Speaker 4] (5:16:12 - 5:17:59)
a year for a market rate unit thank you for that information joe i appreciate that i'll say you know alderman capelman i know you had the community advisory board and i know you told us those vote results um i do know just because of some of the articles um i know we spoke last month that you know there was a vote that was changed um gentrification um the loss of affordable housing of sros um the big changes we've seen in uptown like developments like this might be making space for for some more people to come in and i you know i look at the density you and i and actually alderman rodriguez have some of the most densely populated wards in the city as we look at our geography so i really question on a zoning basis right if this is the best use um the displacement of people who've left uptown because of the loss of affordable housing you mentioned all those buildings that you've lost and i very much know the struggle of not having a lot of tools to keep those buildings right like we can't dictate who buys and sells their property and also this just does not seem to be the type of place that current low-income uptown residents are going to be able to live um i don't think there are enough community benefits going into this and so you know i would you know i can't support this project um based on where it's at and you know respectfully i'd move a motion uh chairman to to defer this um i put that motion forward so on a motion to defer uh we're going

[Speaker 1] (5:17:59 - 5:20:33)
to have to take a roll call on that correct okay all right so alderman had makes the motion uh to defer this and i'm going to start with the roll call so obviously we have alderman capelman wants to move this forward today and uh voting yes would defer it so date certain and voting no would be to continue to have a vote on this today all right so so uh alderman hopkins alderman dowell no alderman sawyer alderman deal alderman ray lopez no alderman david moore no alderman mike rodriguez yes alderman sitio lopez aye alderman burnett no alderman cardona no alderman wagus back no no alderman austin no alderman viegas alderman riley no alderman capelman no alderman osterman no alderman hadden aye and chairman tony is a no bill is another i'm sorry who did i hear that no no bill thank you oh i'm sorry vice chair we're a voice i forgot the time no okay so um that being said uh we will continue on and i'll i'll entertain a motion uh to move do pass by the same roll

[Speaker 4] (5:20:33 - 5:20:38)
call that was used to determine so move mr chairman all right to be recorded as a no chair

[Speaker 1] (5:20:40 - 5:20:50)
okay did i see other hands up no uh mr chairman yeah i have my hand up okay we'll start with uh

[Speaker 33] (5:20:50 - 5:21:31)
alderman dowell yeah i thank you chairman um i just wanted to uh say to alderman capelman that i know he's very thoughtful about how he approaches housing development in his ward and alderman capelman i don't know if this is appropriate uh but i just want you to tell our committee how you see the housing landscape up in uptown you and i have discussed this so um i i think your view on how you're approaching this is helpful okay and i appreciate the

[Speaker 1] (5:21:31 - 5:21:44)
question and i'm going to ask alderman capelman to uh respond but before before he does briefly alderman beal was there a question on process or something else it was a procedure mr chairman

[Speaker 43] (5:21:44 - 5:21:50)
um you know i think it's only right procedurally that you announce what the vote is before moving

[Speaker 1] (5:21:50 - 5:22:27)
on thank you very much for uh processing that with me the vote 13 net in the negative and three in the affirmative all right the motion has failed and i asked for a vote from the um committee in regards to the uh positive vote of from the vote that established quorum but before we get that uh alderman capelman you want to say that's the final comment on this sure it's uh alderman dow

[Speaker 3] (5:22:27 - 5:24:07)
uh thanks for the question and it's a tough one that we all grapple with um now i answer it the way i answer any tough decision that i'm faced with um there's three criteria number one i look at what's ultimately fair uh on all sides that's that's really important to me and all the conversations i've had with with mayor lightfoot and our previous mayor um i've said if you want to appeal to me appeal first to my sense of fairness uh secondly i want to make sure that what we're doing is based on the use of evidence-based best practices so i looked i've done an incredible amount of research about what cities across the country are doing to protect and build more affordable housing and um i've also had extensive conversations with commissioner cox and commissioner navarro about that and then the third and final thing that's most important to me is i want to make sure whatever i look at i understand the negative repercussions of that decision and if i don't understand those negative repercussions then i believe i'm not adequately educated on that subject and for this particular uh development and we've had oh five large community meetings two to three hours long the meetings are even on the ward website the taped meetings um we looked at all the the different ramifications and this is what we decided and this is what i believe is going to work best um for protecting the diversity uh in

[Speaker 1] (5:24:07 - 5:24:23)
the uptown uh community so so thank you so much okay thank you alderman capelman so i got a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum by alderman carrie austin

[Speaker 4] (5:24:23 - 5:24:29)
any objections to the motion alderman hadden would like to be recorded as a no please chair

[Speaker 1] (5:24:29 - 5:25:30)
alderman hadden is is a no are there any other comments okay so this uh item is passed as revised with the uh noting that alderman maria haddon is a no vote on this item mr chairman sorry alderman sitio lopez also is a no okay so we'll record both uh alderman haddon and alderman sitio lopo sitio lopez as an as nos all right anything else all right then i need a motion chairman i to adjourn alderman thank you mr chairman okay thank you and thank you um alderman lopez makes the motion to adjourn so the meeting any opposed to the motion now carrying on this meeting is adjourned and we said thank you everybody for the long meeting and uh we're now going into rules uh we'll be starting momentarily thank you chairman
