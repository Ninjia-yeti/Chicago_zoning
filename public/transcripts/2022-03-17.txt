[Speaker 1] (4:55 - 6:25)
Hey, good afternoon, everybody. The Committee on Transportation and Public Way is now called to order. Pursuant to applicable law and my determinations that attendance by remote means is necessary because an in-person meeting is not practical or prudent due to the declared public health emergency disaster caused by COVID-19.

This meeting is conducted by video conference. I'm going to go through the roll call to establish quorum. Please unmute your microphone.

I will recognize you if I see you. If I don't see you, I will call out your name. Alderman Brookings, I'm here.

I see you, Alderman Rodriguez. Alderman King, are you here? I am present.

Thank you, Chairman. Good to see you. I see you, Alderman Harris.

Alderman Burke, are you here? Alderman Burke, are you here? Alderman Moore, are you here?

Alderman Taylor, are you here? Yes, sir. Good to see you.

I see you, Alderman Scott. I see you, Alderman Ciccio Lopez. Are you here, Ariel?

[Speaker 4] (6:28 - 6:29)
Alderman David Moore is present.

[Speaker 1] (6:30 - 7:25)
Thanks. Thanks, Alderman Moore. Alderman Wagus-Pack, I see you here.

Alderman Austin, are you here? Alderman Austin. I see you, Alderman Ramirez-Rosa.

And I see you, Alderman Dasquez. We do have a quorum. We have 12 members present.

Public comment. At this time, we will begin the public comment period. Out of respect for everybody's time, each speaker is limited to three minutes.

Pursuant to Rule 58, public comments will be limited to a total of 30 minutes. Does anybody hear me? This is Alderman Dasquez.

Just want to be kind of a roll call. Got you, Alderman Dasquez. Thank you.

[Speaker 4] (7:25 - 7:29)
Chairman, we don't have any public speakers that I know of.

[Speaker 1] (7:30 - 7:56)
All right. Thank you. Somebody will stop calling.

All right. With that said, that concludes the public comment period. I move we approve the Rule 45 report for the Committee on Transportation and Public Way held on February 15, 2022, which passed by a voice vote.

Are there any objections?

[Speaker 4] (7:59 - 8:01)
So moved by Alderman Dave Moore. No objections.

[Speaker 1] (8:02 - 10:31)
With that said, the Rule 45 report will be approved by the members present to determine quorum. Today we have six items on the agenda. Going out of order on page three is one direct introduction for miscellaneous items introduced by the local alderman from the 5th Ward.

Also going out of order on page four is the substitute ordinance for miscellaneous items introduced by the local alderman from the 34th Ward. Alderman Taylor moves that we accept the direct introduction and the substitute ordinance in committee. Hearing no objections, so ordered.

On page two includes one ordinance for grants of privilege introduced by the local alderman from the 21st Ward. Alderman King moves that we recommend approval of this item by the affirmative vote of all members present for the roll call to determine quorum. Are there any objections?

Hearing no objections, so ordered. Items on pages three through four include 17 ordinances for miscellaneous items introduced by the local alderman from wards two, five, eight, 13, 19, 27 through 30, 34, 40 through 43 and 45. Alderman Harris moves that we approve these items by the affirmative vote of all members present for the roll call to determine quorum.

Are there any objections? Hearing no objections, so ordered. Next on page five, a proposed right-of-way opening segment of Clarence Avenue, item number 02022-657.

A proposed right-of-way opening for widening of West Clarence Avenue between North Canfield Avenue and North Overhill Avenue located in the 41st Ward. Here to speak, we have Grant Davis, coordinating planner for CDOT. Mr. Davis, are you there?

[Speaker 3] (10:32 - 10:33)
I am, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (10:33 - 10:41)
Do you just want to briefly explain this?

[Speaker 3] (10:41 - 11:44)
Yes. Good afternoon. For the record, my name is Grant Davis.

I am a coordinating planner with the city's Department of Transportation. The ordinance before you is a no compensation street opening ordinance. It will allow the opening of the recently constructed public portion of 7733 to 7759 West Clarence Avenue.

The acquisition of the right-of-way was previously authorized by the City Council. The ordinance before you will allow the official opening of the public way as a street. This opening corrects an anomaly that resulted in a substandard right-of-way width.

Approximately 276 linear feet of right-of-way was widened from 32 feet to 41 feet. This allowed the adjacent seven residences to utilize their driveways without hitting a fence that was budding up against the previous right-of-way. Additionally, a cul-de-sac was constructed on the west end of the street to allow emergency vehicles to safely turn around.

CDOT and LAW have reviewed the plat of opening and the associated legal description and have no concerns. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (11:45 - 13:15)
Thanks. Are there any questions regarding this issue? I see no hands raised and seeing no one with question.

Alderman Rodriguez moved that we recommend approval of this item by the affirmative vote of all members present for the roll call to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing no objections.

I'm sorry. Well, no. Hearing no objections.

Okay. Next, we have a proposed on page 640 for Commons resubdivision 02022-658. A proposed resubdivision bounded by approximately East 44th Street, East 45th Street, South Wabash, South State Street for Grand Boulevard Terrace LLC.

The subdivision includes a direct dedication of a new public alley by the applicant and a small alley opening by P, I'm sorry, by DPD. This property is located in the third ward. We have attorney Richard Tooth from Georgia's law firm.

[Speaker 2] (13:18 - 15:16)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I'm available to speak sometimes if you don't want law or CBOT to go first, I can proceed. Yeah, why not? Okay, thank you.

Good afternoon again, Mr. Chairman, other members of the committee. My name is Richard Tooth, I'm appearing on behalf of the applicant to Grand Boulevard Terraces LLC on its application, as the chairman said, for resubdivision alley dedication and alley opening. Also with me is the applicant's principal, Raphael Lowenstein.

The proposed subdivision is generally along the 4400 block of South Wabash, and the 4400 block of South State Street, all in the third ward. The applicant is planning to build multi unit residential buildings along the streets. At the request of CBOT we're resubdividing, and the applicant is also proposing to dedicate a new alley to provide rear access to those properties.

The new alley will extend south from 44th Street, and it will exit west off onto State Street. No vacations are proposed. The applicant is dedicating the land to the city for the new alley.

Of course the applicant will install the alley infrastructure and construct the alley at its own cost. The applicant will also be paying a $75,000 deposit to guarantee the proper performance of that alley improvement work. The project was of course presented to Alderman Dowell for her approval prior to the filing of our application.

Our site plan has been approved by the Department of Transportation, and of course as part of the application process, various city departments and utilities have reviewed our application. We can talk more but before concluding we'd like to thank the team at the Department of Transportation for all their hard work and their helpful input on this application, and we will respectfully request your favorable recommendation.

[Speaker 1] (15:18 - 15:32)
Thanks, Attorney Toth. Are there any questions of Attorney Toth? We do have Joe Cashman from the City Law Department.

[Speaker 4] (15:37 - 15:52)
Good afternoon. Law has no objections. I commend Mr. Toth on his excellent advocacy and his explanation of the situation. I'm not sure if CDOT would like to have any comment.

[Speaker 1] (15:56 - 17:16)
CDOT, any questions, comments, or jokes? I do note that we do have a letter on file from Alderman Dowell, and there is no compensation needed for this project. With that said, Alderman Wagesbeck moves that we approve this item by the affirmative vote of all members present for the roll call to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing no objections, so ordered. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. No, thank you, Attorney Toth. See, if you didn't speak, your client would have thought this was too easy. Is there anybody who attended this meeting that I did not catch earlier when we did the roll call?

All right. There being no further business before this committee, Alderman Harris moves that we adjourn by the same roll call vote that was applied to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing no objections, so ordered. Thank you, everybody. The meeting on transportation and public way is hereby adjourned.
