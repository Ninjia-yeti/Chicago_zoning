Good morning, Chairman. Good morning. Good morning, committee members.

[Speaker 1] (2:06 - 2:40)
Morning. So we do have a quorum, and we are going to start this morning off with the approval of the Rule 45 report containing the minutes of the June 25th report on zoning, landmark and building and hearing. All right.

Try to mute yourself, folks. All members of the committee should have received a copy of this report electronically. And if hearing no objections, do I have a motion by the same roll call vote that was used to determine quorum to approve the minutes?

[Speaker 3] (2:44 - 3:06)
Attorney. Chairman. Sorry.

Call for orders of the day. Just want to make sure that when I want to make sure that there's a there wasn't an email that was circulated yesterday about a direct introduction by the Department of Planning. So I just want to make sure that that is the agenda for today.

[Speaker 1] (3:07 - 3:14)
Are you still voting on the rule? Yes. I'm asking for the approval of the rule.

[Speaker 39] (3:14 - 3:17)
Alderman Wagesback moves to pass the Rule 45.

[Speaker 1] (3:19 - 3:29)
Alderman Wagesback makes the motion. All those in favor. Aye.

Aye. Any opposed. And you know, the chair, the ayes have it.

[Speaker 3] (3:29 - 3:31)
And the. I'm sorry, but.

[Speaker 1] (3:31 - 5:00)
No, no, wait. I just want to check the agenda. OK.

Alderman. C. Lopez, the direct introduction is on the committee report.

So I just just that's the simple answer to your question. So now we're going to move to the public comment period. OK.

All right. So we'll start in the order. And by the way, committee members, we have nine public speakers that originally registered and we will hear from them.

And then with the request of our colleague on the committee, C. Lopez, we have another nine people that want to talk about the introduction of the mayor, the mayor's direct introduction and or the potential landmarking of the Pilsen district. So just FYI, we are doing a.

I'm using a point of privilege to give Alderman C. Lopez and his constituents an opportunity to talk about the landmark ordinance. And we also have at some point with this is going to be heard on the last part of our zoning committee.

And we will hear not only from the alderman and his constituents, but we will also hear from the department of planning. So that being said, I'm going to ask for the first witness to speak. Carmela Sutton.

[Speaker 55] (5:03 - 6:42)
Hello. My name is Camilla Sutton. I've lived in North Austin community for over 20 years and I'm a member of the North Austin play community located directly in front of where the proposed center will be built.

I'm on the board of directors for this data community represent 192 properties and over 600 residents that support the building of this community athletic center in North Austin, growing up in this community resources have always been limited. We do not have a grammar school and walking distance. Our neighborhood high school is forming, even though that is past Fullerton and processors in our backyard.

So it's hearing of the possibility of having a youth facility in our community. I've been consumed with joy to know that positive resources are being made available to our youth, especially those at risk, giving them something that will keep them off the street and provide them with positive interactions and mentors. So many resources and funds are given to South Austin and the 29th ward portion of Austin oftentimes creating an economic divide, bringing light to this section of North Austin will hopefully open many more doors and promote economic development and growth in our area, especially on the children's sites that have set vacant and been an eyesore to our community for decades.

I'm thankful that grace and peace and by the hand partnership have chosen to bring the center to this area of North, North often as I've seen the benefits that it has given the kids in South Austin, grace and peace has been a blessing with the work they currently do for us from providing food PPE resources during this trying times after school resources and opportunities to all I'm thankful for both organizations and blessed to be able to see the positive things happening in this area.

Thank you to everyone that's involved and I can't wait to see this building break ground.

[Speaker 1] (6:46 - 6:49)
Thank you. Our next speaker is Claritha Jenkins.

[Speaker 64] (6:54 - 8:04)
Good morning. My name is Claritha Jenkins. I live right across the street from what the center is to break ground.

I am a member of the board of the Galeway Unclosed. Chicago is a sports town. It has produced great talent in all sports.

Children often have dreams one day playing pro ball. That dream can become a reality. They often have this dream at an early age by having an athletic center in North Austin will certainly make those dreams come true.

The athletic center will be a place of safety. They will be taught discipline team effort and work ethics. This will be an opportunity of jobs and others will want to invest in this community.

Grace and peace. By the hand alone with myself is excited to have the center like this come to our neighborhood. It is something we can be proud of a place we can see our children grow.

We all say that the children are our future. So let's invest in their future so they can become great leaders for tomorrow.

[Speaker 1] (8:04 - 8:11)
Thank you. Our next speaker is Joshua Zerati.

[Speaker 47] (8:14 - 10:22)
Good morning, Alderman and fellow speakers, Chicagoans. My name is Joshua Zerati. I am one of the master board members here at the Enclave at Galewood Crossing.

Dangerous environments and situations await many of our children and families, especially here in our beloved city of Chicago. There is a need for a safe place where families are treated with dignity and kids escape negative influences such as gang recruitment, violence and drugs. What are the benefits of a community center here in Austin?

A community center's main purpose should be to provide opportunities for active living and recreation in a safe and inclusive environment. This community center can have a stabilizing effect on lives of our young people by providing adequately equipped spaces for physical activities like baseball, basketball, dance, and other sports activities. The role of this community center is to create this perfect setting for local mentorship programs, providing guidance, leadership for development for the youth of this community.

Recreation centers increase property value. A study of a 16,000 home sale in Portland, Oregon showed 8 to 20 percent increase in property value when a home is 15, 1500 feet or less from a public recreation center. A community recreation center can foster community pride and bring people together.

The social bonds that are created at a community center help build strong, safe and inclusive communities, social interaction, volunteerism and community pride. After school programs can help deter at risk youth from criminal activities and can provide a positive environment for this community. This community center is meant for all ages, all ethnicities and promote cultural diversity and inclusion, especially in these trying times that we are experiencing.

This recreation center will be the piece that makes this Austin neighborhood whole. Thank you. Have a great day.

[Speaker 1] (10:25 - 10:29)
All right. Our next speaker is Elida Cruz.

[Speaker 31] (10:34 - 12:42)
Hi, I'm so sorry. I was muted. So anyway, yes.

My name is Elida Cruz and I've been a member of the Enclave community now for 12 years. As such, I've always I've participated on the ad hoc committee as well as the master board. What we're looking at is the importance of the importance of.

Of such a facility in our community. I believe that there are five reasons that that this community, the NACC will impact. The first is that it's going to create a hub of activity for our youth, the families in the community, the senior citizens and civic organizations.

Number two, it's going to provide a safe and adequate equipped space for physical activities. Number three, it's going to help to instill self-discipline and improve self-esteem for those who attend. Number four, it's going to teach both young and old that it's never too late or too early to create healthy exercise habits.

It will help our youth to develop the importance of teamwork and teach leadership skills that will propel them to higher levels as we recognize as we recognize the unprecedented challenges that are posed to us in the last few months. The NACC brings hope and revitalization to our community. As new jobs are created, as programs and tournaments take place, people are likely to bring money to local restaurants and stores, helping to boost sales.

Property values will improve as people become drawn to the affordable amenities in the community. In closing, I am happy to support the collaborative partnership between Grace and Peace Ministries and By the Hand. These two organizations have worked tirelessly to bring this project to the forefront today, and their relentless courage and pursuit to ensure the well-being of the families in this community is inspiring and should move us all to want to do better.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (12:44 - 12:47)
Thank you. Our next speaker is Pamela Washington.

[Speaker 50] (12:49 - 14:42)
Good morning. Okay. Good morning.

My name is Pamela Washington. I am a 10-year resident of the Enclave at Gatewood Crossing, a 30-year resident of the Austin area. It is indeed with pleasure that I will welcome this athletic center as when I open my blinds and front door in the mornings, it will be the first thing that I see.

It will be a welcome addition to our viewing pleasure. The athletic center, with everything that it is scheduled to have, the indoor track, the facilities will just be awesome. As we're out in the mornings and we see several individuals out walking the areas, trying to stay physically fit during these times, when our good winter comes, it will be great to have the indoor track, and so we can continue just on our goals and journeys to be in focus on our health.

The benefits, I just see extreme benefits for the North Austin community as it will range from the construction to the post-construction of the facility with jobs left and right, even if it only, you know, we get down to just grounds maintenance. These are jobs all over the buildings that will just attract everyone from the area, the communities, to just be a part of something great. It is just simply rewarding to be part of something great.

And I'm truly excited with the work that Grace and Peace and By the Hand Partnership are doing as we've gone over several times to help volunteers during our COVID with just being part of the community and the church, visiting the church to just continue to do our part just to help everyone through these partnerships, the economic benefits, and my personal desire to have the athletic center right across the street.

I'm just with open arms just excited to see this project come to life. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (14:44 - 14:56)
Thank you. Our next speaker is Alma Velez. Alma Velez.

[Speaker 57] (14:59 - 16:30)
Alma Velez. Good morning. My name is Alma Velez.

I am a grandparent and a foster great aunt of six by the hand students, one in seventh grade, fifth grade, fourth grade, second grade, first grade, and kindergarten. I am here in support of North Community Center By the Hand and Grace and Peace Church. I learned about By the Hand by living in the community for 15 years and witnessing the making of our neighborhood.

Also by moving Everest Charter School where five of my children attend. I am so grateful to By the Hand for so many different things. My foster great niece Chocola was behind in reading when she started five years ago.

Today she is a fifth grader reading seventh grade level. All of my children have made so many improvements. My fourth grader was shy, very quiet, and wouldn't speak at all.

One day Ms. Jasenia in chapel encouraged her to have faith and to believe in herself. They went to camp one summer and she came back a new person, speaking and participating in all activities. I am grateful to By the Hand for making my children feel safe in this community.

I became so involved at By the Hand that I am now working there. I am excited for more families to have the help and support I was given and I'm really looking forward to all the ways the new community center will serve our children.

[Speaker 1] (16:30 - 17:22)
Thank you. Thank you. Our next speaker, Andrew Washington.

Andrew Washington. Andrew. Andrew, we can't hear you.

Are you unmuted? All right. Let's move on to Ruben Robinson.

Let me try it again. Ruben Robinson.

[Speaker 45] (17:26 - 19:33)
Yeah. Hello. My name is Ruben.

Hello. Proceed, Ruben. Good morning.

My name is Ruben Robinson. I'm the CEO of Empowerment Consulting Group, financial group, rather. I am a senior advisor to the CEO of Empowerment I'm here in support of the North Austin Community Center along with Donita, Travis, Grace and Peace Church, and the Honorable Alderman Mitch.

My connection to By the Hand Club began when Alderman Mitch had Donita contact me when they were building the second By the Hand Club in Austin. It has been a very good relationship that we've been building over the last five years. We've put over 80 people to work from the neighborhood on two different projects.

These projects have not only transformed the neighborhood, but individuals in our community. Jimmy was one of the laborers at one of the By the Hand projects in 2015. I ran into him at a grocery store and he told me that the project had picked him up full time and he's really doing good.

He bought him some properties and he's really doing good and taking care of his family and the community as well. It's been great for him. The project I've worked on at By the Hand Club, it doesn't have the MBE and the WBE and local hires do a city sales agreement.

There were no requirements whatsoever during this time that we were working on the project, but because it was the right thing to do, By the Hand Club supports the community. I have served on the leadership committee for the North Austin Community Center through the Honorable Alderman Mitch and eager to put more people to work on this project in North Austin. We believe that we can put together 70 to 100 people to work on this project and I'm proud of working with them on this project at this time.

Deacon Andrew, if I can introduce him, he's right here next to me. Thank you very much.

[Speaker 58] (19:36 - 19:37)
I'm Deacon Andrew Washington.

[Speaker 1] (19:38 - 19:48)
Okay. Hold on. So Andrew, you're connected, you're on speaker now for the three minute period.

Andrew Washington.

[Speaker 58] (19:49 - 21:19)
Hi, I'm Andrew Washington. I've been a resident in the neighborhood for 27 years. I moved in the neighborhood.

It was very nice. Kids could go outside and play. The milkman could leave the milk on the porch, the paper boy on the porch.

We had a nice neighborhood, but all of a sudden it became a change. Drugs moved in, alcohol moved in, liquor stores came in the neighborhood, and all of a sudden the older people couldn't go to the store. The users was watching the old folks as they go to the store, like lions watching wizard bees looking for the weakest one to push him down.

But all of a sudden, here come a star in the neighborhood, Danita Travis. She met me and we talked together and she told me what she wanted to do. She built by the hand.

There came a change in the neighborhood. She built moving areas. There came a change in the neighborhood.

There's a big difference. Our children are learning. In the North Austin area, I commend you all for letting that come in.

I stand by her 100% to let this go through and that change will change the neighborhood. I know that it will. I'm a witness of all of this.

God bless you and be with you.

[Speaker 1] (21:21 - 21:28)
The next speaker is Hubert, and correct me if I butcher this last name, Ciaromski.

[Speaker 30] (21:32 - 21:35)
That was perfectly said, Alderman. Thank you. Do you hear me all?

[Speaker 1] (21:36 - 21:43)
Yeah. And the Irish guy has a problem sometimes with those, among other last names too.

[Speaker 30] (21:43 - 24:14)
Alderman, I thank you for the opportunity to speak for the three minutes. My name is Hubert Ciaromski. I am the current sitting chairman of the board of the Copernicus Foundation, located at 5216 West Lawrence, corner of Lips and Jefferson Park, adjacent to 4841 North Lips, which is under consideration for a zoning change.

For the past eight years and two aldermanic seats in Ward 45, the Copernicus Foundation has made it very well known to the aldermen in the seats, Department of Planning, city officials, of our interest in acquiring the property at 4841 North Lips in Chicago. We were never given the opportunity nor notification of the ability only through rumors. We were never notified, however, in the last 30 days we were notified of an upcoming zoning change and potential sale, which we understand by city's tweet that it is for a dollar for the fire station at 4841 North Lips.

I'm here today not to ask for anything other than for a 30 day deferment to give our foundation that's been serving Chicago for over 50 years an opportunity to submit an alternative proposal as per the negotiated sale process outlined by the city of Chicago. To summarize, we object to the proposed zoning change at this time, given that this property's location and direct proximity to our foundation. The property is a valuable asset to us and we are ready, willing, and able to make an offer well in excess of the dollar proposed sales price.

A 30 day deferment will allow us to prepare and have an equal opportunity to share our vision of the site with all of Chicago. We also have no intention, no intention of taking the property off the tax rolls. The building has been a part of the Taste of Colonia, Chicago's second largest food festival and neighborhood festival for the past 45 years, and it would be a necessity for the festival to continue.

I thank you for your time and consideration in asking for this 30 day deferment would only give us the opportunity to have an equal opportunity to bid on the property as per the city of Chicago guidelines. I thank you and have a wonderful day.

[Speaker 1] (24:14 - 25:37)
Thank you very much. Now we are going to hear a series of speakers on the Pilsen Landmark District recommendation that was approved by the Landmark Commission May of last year, has yet to receive city council hearing. At this point, I wanted to make sure that our committee members know that the mayor's direct introduction on the Pilsen Landmark District extends this period from basically August through January 2021 to give more time for the Department of Planning, the residents and businesses in Pilsen, and the aldermen to figure out course of action for the betterment of their community.

So I'm going to start, there'll be, I believe, nine speakers, and, but for the edification of my committee members, I wanted to give a little bit of context to the following speakers who may or may not be in support of the Landmark Commission's recommendation. So with that, I'm going to ask for, I think it's Marcos Carbajal, Carbajal? I'm sorry about the name, but how about Marcos?

[Speaker 48] (25:37 - 25:38)
No problem.

[Speaker 1] (25:38 - 25:39)
Okay.

[Speaker 48] (25:39 - 25:40)
No problem. Totally.

[Speaker 1] (25:40 - 25:46)
And each speaker has three minutes, just like the initial nine. So proceed, Marcos.

[Speaker 28] (25:47 - 28:54)
Okay. Thank you for the introduction. My name is Marcos Carbajal.

I am the co-owner of Carnitas Uruapan Restaurant over at 1725 West 18th Street. We've been in the community since 1975, I believe we're likely the oldest restaurant in the community, and I wanted to talk a little bit about my opposition to landmark status over in the 18th Street District. Primarily I feel that landmarking the 18th Street Corridor is largely unneeded.

We as community members, as business owners are very proud of our, you know, upkeeping our buildings and maintaining them, you know, in a very, you know, good condition. I feel that landmarking status is largely unnecessary and largely will create just a more cumbersome process for us to be able to maintain or really preserve our buildings or modify them in any way whatsoever. My recent experience with this was when doing a routine, a routine permit for an awning and a sign.

We've had, you know, an awning and a sign there for years, but now that the landmark status is there on 18th Street, it just became a kind of bureaucratic cumbersome process to do something very routine. We were not approved with the design that was already in place that had been there for years and had to really look at potentially completely redoing our storefront, especially during a time where, you know, expenses were kind of high and, you know, business isn't so great. We reached out to Alderman Byron Siegjo to get some help, ended up working through the process of the landmark hold and working through it with an expediter at our expense and ended up spending thousands of dollars really to deal with a matter just to keep something the way we had always kind of had it in some shape or form for the last 40 plus years.

So I think it really creates a tough set of guidelines that are hard to meet for a lot of business owners and creates a lot more red tape to maintaining your building and trying to make any modification that you need to do to your building and really just creates another tool for people to not be able to hold on to their buildings and not be able to comply with some of the things required by landmark status. So we're opposed.

We see it as a infringement on our property rights and essentially kind of telling us what we have to do with something that we've already maintained and we've already kept in good condition for, you know, in our situation for 45 years. And I think my three minutes might be up, so I just wanted to wrap it up with that. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (28:54 - 28:57)
Thank you, Marcus. Our next speaker is Juan Zavala.

[Speaker 63] (29:02 - 29:14)
Chairman, we don't have Juan Zavala. We didn't get phone numbers of these additional speakers. OK.

So there are three phone numbers. We can maybe go to them after all the known ones.

[Speaker 1] (29:14 - 29:23)
OK. All right. Let's proceed.

Joel Putman. Joel Putman.

[Speaker 34] (29:24 - 32:27)
Sorry. Yeah, thank you, Chairman. My wife, Catherine, and I have owned our property for about three years now.

We're new to the neighborhood. But, you know, the neighborhood is very vibrant and the community is wonderful and everyone has been supportive of us. We initially began seeking to approve our property in late 2017 and had continually hit walls and barriers at every step.

Along with many of my neighbors and community members, I have participated in numerous public hearings, community committees and workshops with not only the alderman's office, but also members of the landmark staff. This direct introduction, again, proves that those same staff have absolutely no interest in listening to the concerns and ideas of the community. And furthermore, the direct introduction here by Mr. Cox clearly demonstrates that he has no intention of working with or listening to the wishes and needs of Wilson. Alderman Lopez's proposed ordinance that was previously introduced is exactly what the community needs, not a landmarks. Historic preservation will not stop gentrification, but rather will increase and take away the equity of us homeowners that may or may not have the means to improve their buildings. And we'll give it directly to the developers.

We have tried for three years to get building permits. We've gone through all of the landmarks processes, all the way to having to fight them at a hearing. We've spent about $30,000 just on this effort, hiring Jonathan Fine, the most well-respected historic preservationist in Chicago.

He fought for saving Prentice. He started Landmark Chicago. And even out of all of that, it took us fighting this tooth and nail after having attempted to work with them.

We won, and yet they send us a letter telling us that we're able to continue so long as we meet the following guidelines with absolutely no guidelines. So at every step of the way, they're stalling us. They're forcing us to spend money.

And fortunately, I'm an architect, a practicing architect with a small firm. I'm able to absorb those costs, but my neighbors can't. If it's someone like us who are supposedly experts in the field and have some means, can't get this done, how is Mrs. Garcia, my neighbor, going to actually be able to do that?

We've listened to them. We've worked with them. And now that the communities come out and work together on this new proposed no demolition ordinance, which will, in fact, stop gentrification and put the rights in the hands of the community rather than City Hall, they're coming back to fight this again.

So I think it needs to be voted down and we need to continue with the ordinance.

[Speaker 56] (32:29 - 32:30)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (32:30 - 32:56)
Thank you. Our next speaker, Ricardo Gamboa. Ricardo Gamboa.

All right. We'll skip him for a second. Hello?

Yes. Ricardo? Yes, this is me.

Okay. Your three minutes are starting.

[Speaker 35] (32:57 - 35:45)
Great. I would like to discuss the landmark ordinance being directly introduced by the mayor today that stands to severely impact Pilsen, a community that's been significant to three generations of my family and where I built a life with my partner. I think I want to start by saying that in March this year at a summit hosted by The Economist in New York, Lori Lightfoot said, quote, Pilsen 10 years ago was a neighborhood we all would have been a little concerned about being in after dark.

Pilsen now is a vibrant, thriving neighborhood. The difference is economic development. End quote.

Lori's wrong. The real difference between Pilsen now and 10 years ago is the loss of over 25 percent of its Latino population and more than 10,000 Latino residents, according to a study by UIC. This isn't economic development.

It's structural racism. In Chicago, for Lightfoot and her predecessor, Rahm, terms like economic development are code for gentrification and the displacement gentrification propels through racial capitalism, real estate development and city governance. Economic development is not the only name gentrification goes by anymore.

And that's a reality. Terms like historic preservation, industrial corridor modernization or green and open space enhancements. And yes, landmark districts are all terms deployed by cities that are seemingly benign or even benevolent, but signal the onslaught of displacement as communities testify.

And studies prove since such initiatives do not stave off gentrification, they feed it. Exemplary of this trend is the construction of the green space, the 606 trail that has been well documented to have exacerbated gentrification by raising property values, attracting developers and wealthier residents and pricing out long term residents in Latino communities like Logan Square. It should be telling to anyone on this committee that this ordinance was also pushed by former alderman Danny Solis as a last wink to developers before he left office.

The fact that Pilsen's agonizing displacement is significantly indebted to Solis and this disgraced alderman has since been outed as verifiably corrupt should be enough to question the intentions and integrity of the landmark ordinance. But more importantly, the community does not want this ordinance. They are not dumb.

And we are well aware that the stricter guidelines for housing repairs that the landmark ordinance would propose would come at a cost to homeowners considering government incentives to fund building repairs would require property owners to invest 25 percent of the property's market value, which in Pilsen would average around over 65K and be expensive for longtime residents and homeowners. So this ordinance would preserve the community's buildings, but not the community's people. The landmark ordinance is nothing less than an ongoing attack on working class residents and residents of color in Pilsen and in Chicago at large.

That includes the loss of over a quarter of a million black residents in a decade. And frankly, I don't trust anyone on this council, a municipal legislative body that has voted against the interests of their constituents and been complicit with harms perpetrated against us. But I would be remiss if I did not share this comment today.

[Speaker 1] (35:46 - 36:03)
Thank you. Thank you. Our next speaker is John Betancourt.

John Betancourt is muted. I believe he's there. You want to unmute, John?

[Speaker 33] (36:08 - 36:09)
Do you hear me now?

[Speaker 1] (36:10 - 36:13)
Yes, sir. Could you identify yourself for the record, please?

[Speaker 33] (36:13 - 39:18)
OK, my name is John Betancourt. I am a board professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago. I have been there for 40 years.

I am an expert in gentrification, have done more studies in Chicago than anybody else. And that includes studies of Pilsen. The proposal is seeking to mitigate or stop gentrification in Pilsen to keep buildings from being torn down, to keep housing affordable and to preserve the community's culture.

My research shows that landmark and historic preservation in comparable cases have always increased the prices of the properties and have had a spillover effect on nearby properties. As far as tear downs, the number that is saved is very limited. If the intent is to stop gentrification, they have to consider a different strategy and apply it to a much larger area.

Particularly, if they want to stop gentrification. As far as affordability, the limited affordability that is offered in reality is not affordable to current Pilsen residents. Most owners cannot receive the tax benefits.

And therefore, what this is doing is offering tax reduction to wealthy and most likely white developers and residents. Cultural preservation, the question is whose history is to be conserved, whose values are being protected. And in reality, the ordinance seeks to preserve buildings with bohemian architecture.

This does not protect the integrity of the Mexican community. It will benefit speculators and consumers of culture. You can take as an example, the Fulton Market in the West Loop that actually made a lot of money for developers on the symbolic significance of these buildings.

When the City of New York proposed a landmark for a building occupied by a famous bookstore, the owner said, landmarking our building will only make it much harder for us to survive and keep the business in the family. In these times where the City of Chicago has implemented eviction rental moratoriums due to COVID, the committee should take a pause until there is further study on the impact of this proposed ordinance. In a wall-to-wall meeting of residents of Pilsen, they all rejected the proposal.

We need to do a democratic process to fully comply with what the council is about. Thank you. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (39:19 - 39:34)
All right. I'm going to call the next two speakers together because they're on the same Zoom. So we'll start with Matt Richmond and then followed by Arturo Garza.

So Matt, you want to start?

[Speaker 36] (39:34 - 42:21)
Yes, thank you. Alderman, my name is Matt Richmond. I'm speaking to you on my own behalf as a Pilsen resident voter and real estate professional with 30 years of experience.

I'm also a member of an informal alliance of Pilsen property owners opposing the landmark. I'm an admirer of old buildings and landmarks. However, the Department of Planning knows this proposal could never pass if it engaged us on facts.

Therefore, it has pursued this designation in a highly unethical manner. First, the city's notice to owners violated their procedural due process rights. The notice reads like a public service announcement, failing to clearly notify owners their property rights are at stake or advise them to consult with council to understand the designation's effects.

Instead, city employees acted like legal and financial advisors, providing owners misleading information about the designation. I encourage you to read the alliance's fact sheets, which details the city's deceptive marketing practices. Second, city employees are too vested in a specific political outcome, manipulating the public discussion to suit their purposes.

The law requires the city to notify an owner of the designation's effects and request consent to the designation in writing. Instead, city employees ran an opinion poll, gauging owner support or opposition to the district, an activity inconsistent with the State Employees Ethics Act. As a result, only 10% of the owners responded.

Yet, even with a 95% opposition, the commission still suggested our community supported the designation because 90% of the owners did not respond. More owners would have responded if they received an accurate explanation of the designation's effects or asked for consent on their property versus an opinion about the district, and the process was controlled by individuals without a perceived influence over permits and inspections. I encourage you to read the alliance survey of owners, which properly documents community opposition.

Finally, I ask you to re-familiarize yourself with the Fair Housing Act and the HUD Justice Department Joint Statement on how the act applies to city ordinances. Quote, even a law that is seemingly neutral will still violate the act if enacted with discriminatory intent. An examination of the city's public notices, its underlying studies, and Alderman Solis' comments reveal a clear intent to perpetuate segregated housing patterns based on national origin and race.

In fact, the city's marketing campaign bears the hallmarks of panic peddling, an illegal practice of inducing people to sell their property, or in this case, to acquiesce to the transfer of their unrestricted property rights based on Pilsen's changing demographics. In sum, I don't care if you're a traditional Democrat or a Socialist. We should unite to oppose this legislation and stop a dangerous agenda seeking to disassociate our communities from our aldermen and put us at the mercy of unelected bureaucrats.

Allow it here and your ward will be next, and your residents will also be questioning their future as Chicagoans.

[Speaker 1] (42:23 - 42:31)
Thank you. So now Arturo, right? Correct.

Proceed Arturo, and this is Arturo Garza.

[Speaker 38] (42:31 - 45:18)
Thank you. Alderman, my name is Arturo Garza and I'm speaking to you as a Pilsen community member and real estate professional with 31 years of experience. I'm also a member of an informal alliance of property owners opposing the landmark designation.

The landmark is wrong for so many reasons. First, the city has no genuine support for this designation in our community. In fact, main supporters are people who live outside of Pilsen, including architects in the Department of Planning and people like Ward Miller with Preservation Chicago.

They care about buildings, not people. It's our community, not theirs. Second, the Planning Department has been dishonest with this designation in its marketing materials.

I ask you to read the alliance fact sheet and its survey. Third, the Planning Department keeps talking about the incentives it's offering. For the most part, these incentives are worthless.

The department makes it look like there are plenty of options, but if you examine these incentives in detail, you will realize very few people would actually benefit from them. Fourth, the district is massive and the commission is clarifying almost every building has contributed, regardless of its architectural or historical significance. Look at the photos of some of the buildings in the alliance fact sheet.

You will agree many of the designations are ridiculous. This landmark is a of generational death. Many families bought Pilsen 20, 30, 40 years ago when it wasn't easy.

Now they're enjoying the benefits of investing in our community. This is their retirement account. This is their 401k.

These owners will lose significant value because they will be unable to sell their properties for their highest and best use. They lack the sophistication, time, money to navigate the landmark's Byzantine process. Finally, I resent the actions of the mayor, the city agencies.

They pretend to care about Mexican-Americans and saving our neighborhood. However, it is clear they are only using us to advance their own careers. I genuinely believe the landmark district was introduced with discriminatory intent and the city is comfortable in manipulating residents based on Pilsen's changing demographics.

It's wrong and it will actually hurt and displace many long-term residents. I will not stand by idly and allow this to continue. If this landmark is extended or passed, I intend to file a complaint with HUD.

The city thinks it can bully us, so I'm going to bring a bigger bully to fight for us. From now to election, Chicago can explain why it constantly pretends to care about Mexican-Americans but abandons us when it really matters. If you actually support Mexican-Americans, their rights to enjoy their property rights like anyone else, if you support your own community and its right to determine its future, if you support good governance and common decency, you will reject this landmark.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (45:21 - 45:24)
Our next speaker is Beto Casas.

[Speaker 22] (45:30 - 48:32)
Beto? Yes, good morning. Good morning.

Yes, my name is Roberto Casas. I'm a long-term resident of Pilsen and also a property owner in Pilsen. I was asked to come on here and speak about my viewpoints with regards to the landmark district and the ramifications of such an act.

Number one, as the other speakers have noted, there's a lot of opposition to this, so I've noted down some of my opposition to this and what the consequences will be. Number one, it's going to lead to higher rents and more displacements of the working-class people that vote for the politicians. Number two, it's going to create a monopoly for investors, and the ones that are going to benefit from this are going to be the investors who are wealthy and have the escrow accounts to purchase out or buy out the long-term residents, which is going to lead to further displacement.

Third of all, if there was ever a worse time to pick to do a landmark district, the only worst time I could think about it would be World War II, during World War II, because back then is when there was scarce loans. Back then is when there was displacement. Back then is when people didn't know if they were going to have a job a week or a month from now, and that's pretty much true today.

People don't know if they're going to have a job a week or a month from now because of what's going on with the ramifications of COVID. If people don't know if they're going to have a job a week or a month from now, they don't know if they're going to be able to pay their rents a week or a month from now, which means that the property owners are not going to know if they're going to be able to pay their mortgages a week or a month from now. So if there was ever a worse time to do this designation, it would be during World War II.

And it's not just me that thinks this. The CEO of JP Morgan Chase, he's setting aside over $10 billion this quarter because they're expecting losses to be in excess of $10 billion on all types of loan products. During the Great Recession, which I lived through, and I had a lot more hair and no gray hair at that point, he was putting aside $8 billion for loan loss provision, which means that they're expecting this massive recession to be at least 25% worse than what it was during the 2007 through 09 Great Recession.

And finally, just to sum up my viewpoint, it's going to come down to the committee deciding between two things. The committee is going to have to decide between the people's will and investor interests. If the zoning committee is going to look for the people's will, the people's will is against the landmark designation.

If they're going to look out for investor interests, then they're going to vote for the investors. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (48:33 - 48:35)
Our next speaker, Laura Ramirez.

[Speaker 29] (48:42 - 51:46)
Can you hear me? Can you hear me? We can hear you.

Hi, good morning. Thank you for having me today. My name is Dr. Laura Ramirez. I am a long-term resident of Little Village, and a member of El Foro del Pueblo as well as the Juruazil. And I'm here today to talk to you about the connections between approving this landmark district, as well as gentrification, and also to really push for the moratorium on demolitions and deconversions that Alderman Byron Cichol Lopez has put forth in the past. So as you might recall, on April 11th, my community was bombarded by taxing dust with very, very little notice.

Actually, the notice came out on Thursday night, a day and a half before the demolition, and all the notice said was to close our windows, to go indoors, and to avoid any type of physical activity outside. We were not notified about the danger that we were about to face. If it wasn't for community activists and residents portraying and actually providing photographs to the outside world about what had happened in our neighborhood, we wouldn't even be talking about this on a city council level at all.

And I know that today we're talking about Pilsen, but you need to remember that our communities are intimately connected through not just our culture, but also the folks that have come to the United States in the search of a new life. We're a highly immigrant population with very little recourse and resources at times when we need them the most. And I'm here to let you know that the decisions made by the mayor, as well as our Alderman Michael Rodriguez, created such an uproar because of its insidiousness and ill-time effects that we had to advocate for our own life in the middle of a pandemic that is taking lives in Little Village.

So I'm here to let you know that this council has at their hands the opportunity to actually vote for the residents of both Pilsen and Little Village, to actually acknowledge and take a step in putting a moratorium on demolitions, which actually the Mayor Lori Lightfoot had already promised that she would do for six months, which she actually went back to as I speak to you right now. There are demolitions occurring only 10 blocks away from me that have been covered up by high-level walls and do not let us see the actual dust plumes that come out. We are really aware, regardless of how you might interpret the facts, that the connection between gentrification and this landmark proposal is clear.

We also understand that the city is used to circumventing due process and coming after the fact with resolutions that do not respond to the needs of the community. By voting on this resolution and this ordinance, you're actually voting to support the displacement of working-class Black, brown people as well as immigrants. You are putting forth this process of misinformation, lack of transparency, and disregard for the needs of our community.

You are punishing our residents for carrying and investing in our properties, and you're allowing for corporations to continue to consume and capitalize on Latinx and Black culture as they kick our people out of our neighborhoods. I urge you to vote no.

[Speaker 1] (51:46 - 52:09)
Thank you. I'm going to do one last call for Juan Zavala. All right, not hearing from Juan, that concludes the public comment period.

Alderman Beal, do you have your hand up?

[Speaker 21] (52:10 - 52:11)
I do, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (52:12 - 52:13)
Proceed.

[Speaker 21] (52:13 - 53:23)
Mr. Chairman, I'm extremely concerned with the comments that Alderman Cinto Lopez stated that a direct introduction is being done by the administration when this was a direct introduction done by the previous alderman in that particular ward. I think that at this particular time, I think in the best interest of the community, the alderman should be the one to do a direct introduction because his community right now is extremely uncomfortable with government, and he is the duly elected alderman of that particular ward. I believe that if any direct introduction as far as the zoning in that particular area should have came from him, or it should have at least been a joint direct introduction.

I just think we need to look at that very closely and adopt the alderman's direct introduction because right now that particular community, from what I can hear, is very uncomfortable with how government is moving forward. So for a comfort level as well as a respect level, I think that direct introduction should come from the alderman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (53:24 - 55:36)
Thank you, alderman. And we're going to have a debate on this subject, but I'm going to go through the regular. Chairman, this is Alderman Sita Lopez.

Alderman Sita Lopez, I will recognize you, but I was speaking on behalf of Alderman Beal's comments. So Alderman Beal, we are going to hear the direct introduction in the second half of our zoning meeting. The alderman will have his chance to talk about his history with his community and the landmark progress or lack thereof.

The reason that we're extending this just FYI for all the committee members is that if we do not act on the landmark ordinance today, it by de facto not responding within a year, this ordinance or the recommendation from the landmark commission becomes the law. So we don't want that to happen without due process with the current alderman. Many of you have gone through landmarks, you know, that it's a year or two or more of working with the communities and this predated Alderman Sita Lopez.

The effort today is an effort to not have the landmark ordinance be killed today and demolitions to begin tomorrow. The point is we're going to give a little breathing room for the department to make its presentation not only today, but I believe we need to engage the community more fervently. And I ask that we have some patience with the process.

And many of you know that the government process is very slow, but it unfortunately is final when it makes its determination. So with that, I'm not going to spend, I'm going to ask Sita Lopez to say a few words, but we are going to move to the other 49 wards and the agenda item for Pilsen will be heard last on the addendum. So Alderman Sita Lopez.

[Speaker 3] (55:37 - 57:47)
Yeah, Chairman Tony, and I appreciate, you know, that you put your perspective on your context and what you think it is the case, right? My job as representative of the 25th ward is not only to represent the best in terms of my community, but also, like you said, to make sure that we work in the spirit of collaboration and the spirit of transparency and accountability. And that's not what happened.

I echo the comments of Alderman Beal, who I'm thankful for raising this issue because this sets a horrible precedent. There has not been collaboration here. There has not been any discussion about the direct introduction.

I do believe that we have to be mindful. There are laws here that we need, we must follow. And I think that what we are doing right now, by ignoring my constituents, small businesses, seniors, people who are really struggling, right?

And then use parliamentary rules, you know, on an email and direct introduction that was sent yesterday. So at 6.52 p.m., you know, to try to bypass, circumvent the local aldermen. I'm talking about helping my community.

Chairman, members of the zoning committee, for those of you who don't know me well, before I was alderman, I was a community organizer and a teacher in my community. And we know very well about the community process and due diligence. This is not what's happening here for what you hear from my constituents.

And it's right. I should have been included in the conversations about a direct introduction, which wasn't the case. This is an imposition using the emergency powers ordinance that already expired at the end of June.

This what we're doing here today sets a bad precedent of the executive power overruling a legislative matter that pertains to the 25th ward. This was something that I inherited by the 25th ward office before me. And this is something that is forced on my community without any conversation.

It is only my office without this emergency power ordinance.

[Speaker 1] (57:47 - 58:00)
All right. Alderman Sitia Lopez, we will. Alderman Lopez.

You've got some time to tell your perspective.

[Speaker 3] (58:00 - 58:43)
It's important that I talk to my colleagues as well to put this in perspective, because what's happening here, right, is not any help to my community. What's happening here is an imposition and my colleagues need to hear. And I just wanted to be noted that my colleagues have received written notification of a direct introduction that I intend to pass today, because that's the right process.

That's the due process. And I hope that you respect the process because this six months, this six would hurt seniors, low-income residents, small businesses in the worst time possible. Colleagues, please listen to my constituents.

An 11th hour introduction without respecting the local alderman sets a horrible precedent. So I hope that we have a larger.

[Speaker 1] (58:43 - 59:23)
Can we move back to the regular business? Alderman, we are moving to the regular order of business. We will have an unlimited amount of time to talk about the landmarking ordinance.

So I'm not muting you because we have 49 other wards with many different applications that we've got to get through. I will give you an inordinate amount of time to talk to us as colleagues, but I need to move to the regular order of the agenda. So that being said, I'm going to move that we will start with the...

[Speaker 26] (59:23 - 59:27)
Mr. Chairman, point of order, Alderman Hopkins on a point of order.

[Speaker 1] (59:27 - 59:31)
Alderman Hopkins on a point of order, not on the Pilsen district.

[Speaker 26] (59:33 - 1:00:14)
Well, yes, on the Pilsen district. I'm just asking at the appropriate time, not now, but at the end of the agenda, as you mentioned, I would request that someone from the planning department make a specific point of weighing out the time frame and the procedure and clarifying whether inaction on this item actually would result in passage. I think we need to be clear on that, how that works with the tolling period of time, et cetera, because there's some confusion.

So before we get into the debate on the merits of it at the appropriate time, I would ask that someone from the planning department in a neutral fashion, explain the procedure and the rules and the calendar.

[Speaker 1] (1:00:15 - 1:00:34)
Thank you. Thank you, Alderman. The planning department is ready, willing, and able to talk about the landmark recommendation.

So I'm going to move. Alderman Raymond Lopez, is this something in regards to that you want to talk or you want to wait until we have the discussion about the Pilsen?

[Speaker 4] (1:00:35 - 1:00:39)
Actually, chairman, I don't know if I missed the roll call, so I was just informing you.

[Speaker 1] (1:00:39 - 1:00:48)
Okay. You're recorded as I, and I have a couple others. I hear- Osterman.

Are you with us? Osterman's with you.

[Speaker 15] (1:00:48 - 1:00:49)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:00:49 - 1:01:00)
Alderman Osterman is here. Alderman Lopez is here. Alderman Sawyer.

I saw him on the- I'm here. All right. Alderman Riley.

[Speaker 5] (1:01:02 - 1:01:06)
I'm just wanting to be recorded as here. All right.

[Speaker 1] (1:01:07 - 1:01:12)
And Alderman David Moore. I saw David. Present.

[Speaker 15] (1:01:13 - 1:01:14)
Thank you, chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:01:15 - 1:03:05)
All right. Alderman Villegas is here. So moving on, we will now hear the items to be deferred.

I will read the ward, the file number, the address, and lastly, the reason for deferral, and take a motion for all at the end. So in the second ward, file number 20242T1, located at 2227 North Clybourne Avenue, for Alderman Hopkins. In the fourth ward, file number 20428, located at various addresses on South Ellis Avenue, South Lake Park Avenue, East 29th Street, East 26th Street, South Vernon Avenue, East 31st Street, South Martin Luther King Drive, has not been before the plan commission.

Next in the 14th ward, file number 20421, located at 3330 through 3356 West 51st Street, per the attorney. In the 27th ward, file number 20435T1, located at 732 through 742 North Noble Street, 1400 through 1402 West Superior Street, per the attorney. In the 46th ward, file number 20429, located at 4400 through 4424, and 4401 through 4415 North Clarendon Avenue, has not been before the plan commission.

Okay, do I hear a motion to defer the items by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Chairman. Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 4] (1:03:06 - 1:03:21)
Alderman Lopez moves. Actually, Chairman, I actually would like to amend the motion. I'd like to include in this motion an item as well, but I'm going to do it as an amendment to the motion once it's...

[Speaker 1] (1:03:21 - 1:03:27)
So you want to add to the defer list per Alderman Lopez? Correct. Okay, what item is that?

[Speaker 4] (1:03:28 - 1:03:36)
Mayoral direct introduction proposing the tolling code section 2-120-0705, please.

[Speaker 1] (1:03:40 - 1:03:52)
We haven't, you know, let me suggest, Alderman, we'll get through the agenda and then we will re-entertain your motion. When we get, we've got a lot of talk, we've got, we've got 49 other words.

[Speaker 4] (1:03:53 - 1:04:00)
I'm not trying to debate the direct introduction right now, I just would like to have it included in the listed deferments.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:01 - 1:04:05)
No, we're not going to accept this discussion about it.

[Speaker 3] (1:04:05 - 1:04:07)
Alderman Lopez, to include the motion.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:08 - 1:04:25)
All right, do I hear a motion to defer these items? Not Alderman Lopez, both Lopez's there. The items for deferrals, do I hear a motion?

Riley so moves. Riley so moves. All those in favor?

[Speaker 71] (1:04:26 - 1:04:26)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:27 - 1:04:33)
Any opposed? No. Alderman Lopez is a no on that.

[Speaker 3] (1:04:34 - 1:04:44)
So for clarification, Alderman, all we're doing is just making sure that the mayoral, the mayoral introduction is included in the item where we're going to discuss the Pilsen Landmark, correct?

[Speaker 1] (1:04:45 - 1:06:12)
Right, I understand that, but we're moving forward, we will have that discussion at the beginning, on the addendum item with a direct introduction in the second half of the meeting. Correct, thank you. Thank you.

Now, let me move on. Okay, so we have, let me make sure, which is the item number, which is the mayoral. The first item, mayoral application 2002 document number 02020-3443, the amendment of the municipal code titles 2 and 15 by adding a new chapter 2-30 entitled multi-agency regulation of implosions and section 15-4-311 providing for additional requirements for a license to use explosives for demolition of building structures.

We have Matt Boudot and Grant Ulrich here from the department of buildings to present on this matter. We also have commissioners of business and consumer affairs, Rosa Escarrino, fire commissioner Richard Ford, the third commissioner of health Allison Arwadi, deputy commissioner of transportation Mike Simon, commissioner of water management Randy Connor, and lastly executive director of OEMC Rich Guidus to answer any questions after the presentation. So Matt, would you want to proceed on that sir?

[Speaker 6] (1:06:13 - 1:11:33)
Sure, good morning chairman Tony and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Matthew Boudot and I'm the acting building commissioner. I'm here this morning to ask for your favorable consideration for mayor Lightfoot's ordinance regarding multi-agency regulation of implosions.

I commend the mayor for establishing a coordinated multi-agency approach to implosions which also provides for a proactive and robust public notice and engagement. I'll just speak to a few of the highlights of the ordinance. The first item in the ordinance implements a moratorium on implosions in the city of Chicago until such time as the corporation council certifies that the multi-agency rules authorized under this ordinance are in full force and effect.

The second item the ordinance implements is a requirement that the city departments with the major role in implosions, buildings, business affairs, and consumer protection, fire, public health, transportation, water management, and emergency management and communication all promulgate rules within 150 days of the effective date of the ordinance specific to implosions and the implosion approval process. All of these rules by this perspective subject matter departments will be posted on a public web page for public comment for no less than 60 days.

It will also allow for any department to hold a public hearing on its rules. Each department is required to provide written response to each comment and may make the appropriate changes to the rules. The comments department responses and proposed rules will then be forwarded to the corporation council.

The rules will become effective 10 days after approval by the corporation council. An important third element of the ordinance is the addition of OEMC as the overall coordinating agency. The mayor instructed us to perform a best practice analysis of other jurisdictions around the country and the best model by far was the city of Philadelphia.

Philadelphia coordinates implosions as a major public event and therefore utilizes the coordinating skills and resources of its offices of emergency management. Just as OEMC here coordinates the various city departments involved in public events like concerts, street festivals, parades, OEMC would be the coordinating agency for an implosion starting no less than 90 days out from the date when an application for a license to use explosives for a demolition is filed with BACP. Various departments will continue to perform their respective cert tasks.

Demolition by implosion permit from the building department, street closure permits from transportation, water hydrant and stormwater permits from water management, hazardous material abatement and dust mitigation plan reviews by public health and explosion license from business affairs and consumer protection with the assistive fire. However, all these efforts, permits, licensings, inspections, notices, monitoring will be coordinated by OEMC during pre, actual and post implosion. The departments will be meeting together with OEMC and the applicant throughout all stages of this process.

An equally important fourth item of this ordinance is the requirement that the applicant submit a comprehensive plan covering all the items under the subject matter of the respective departments plus the overall operational plan, the hazardous material abatement plan, the dust mitigation plan, the air quality management plan and the community notification plan and post implosion cleanup plan. An equally important fifth item in the ordinance is a requirement that the applicant improve, include proof that the applicant mailed notices to owners and occupants of all buildings located within 1000 feet of the property line where the implosion proposal is to be used and also to the local alderman. The notice shall describe the intended use of explosives, the date, time and location of a public meeting required by the ordinance, shall also include the emergency contact phone number for the applicant, which the applicant shall monitor from the date of the application through the completion of the demolition.

The ordinance further requires a posted notice on the site of the property containing the above mentioned date, time and location of the public meeting and the applicant's emergency contact number. An equally important sixth item in the ordinance is a requirement that the applicant host a public meeting at its own expense no less than 30 days and no more than 60 days after the filing of the application. The public meeting must be held within two miles of the proposed implosion site.

It must accommodate a minimum of 50 public attendants and must provide for a minimum of two hours of public questions. Finally, the ordinance addresses the ordinance requires additional community notifications of no less than seven days or no more than 30 days from the implosion date to be provided in the form of manner approved by the OEMC executive director. The OEMC executive director can also require additional community notifications to be delivered by mail, hand, electronically or telephone and in multiple formats could be all of them and in multiple languages.

Again, thank you for the opportunity to speak today. I respectfully ask for your favorable consideration in this ordinance. As Alderman Tunney mentioned, Chairman Tunney mentioned, I'm joined here today by representatives of the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection, Fire, Public Health, Law, Transportation, Water Management and OEMC who may also wish to offer their testimony.

We are happy to answer any questions. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:11:37 - 1:11:44)
Thank you, Matt. Alderman Beal, questions for the Department of Buildings or the various departments on the call?

[Speaker 21] (1:11:44 - 1:11:52)
Absolutely. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My first question is what happened to the moratorium that was already in place before the last implosion took place?

[Speaker 1] (1:11:57 - 1:11:57)
Matt?

[Speaker 6] (1:11:59 - 1:12:09)
Yes, Alderman. This moratorium, as you know, we'd like the city council to have input on this and the city council is being asked to pass the moratorium.

[Speaker 21] (1:12:10 - 1:13:09)
No, I'm talking about the moratorium that was in place prior to the implosion that took place over in Little Village. What happened to that moratorium? Because the city already had a moratorium in place.

I'm not aware of any moratorium on implosions prior to the last one. Okay, I need you to research that because I'm pretty sure that there was a moratorium already in place and this last one was signed off on. Maybe you guys didn't know about the moratorium that was already in place.

So, I would really encourage you to research that and look into it, number one. Number two, everything that you testified on, everything that you presented to us, just basically give the Alderman the same notification that goes out to the 1,000 people within 1,000 feet of the implosion area. Why doesn't the Alderman have authority over any part of this process?

[Speaker 6] (1:13:13 - 1:13:18)
Well, Alderman, this is the same process that we've had previously for demolitions.

[Speaker 21] (1:13:18 - 1:13:45)
I believe you received notice of that. Notice, but can the Alderman say, I don't want this implosion to take place in my ward? I don't believe this ordinance addresses that.

Okay, nor can the Alderman say, well, you know what, I need to have more, you know, community input. I need to make sure that the community is fully aware of what's going on to my satisfaction of my community. What part of that process gives us that comfort level?

[Speaker 6] (1:13:46 - 1:13:52)
I think you'd probably work with the various departments and OEMC and the community outreach plan.

[Speaker 21] (1:13:52 - 1:13:59)
Okay, isn't it the authority of you all to work with us versus us work with you all as the elected officials?

[Speaker 6] (1:14:02 - 1:14:05)
I don't know, Alderman, I think the ordinance speaks for itself where it's at.

[Speaker 21] (1:14:06 - 1:14:24)
I hope all my colleagues see exactly what's happening here and hopefully the zoning committee is fully aware that this process is going to circumvent, once again, automatic input and approval of anything that's happening in our wards. And I want you all to proceed with caution. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:14:25 - 1:14:31)
Thank you, Alderman Beall. Alderman Lopez. Raymond.

[Speaker 4] (1:14:32 - 1:14:51)
I'm here, Chairman. Proceed. Thank you, Chairman.

And good morning, colleagues. I have a couple of questions for you. How many implosions do you anticipate in the city of Chicago impacted by this ordinance?

[Speaker 6] (1:14:52 - 1:15:02)
I think the last implosion was the last one since I've been with the city. They're a rarity. Nationally, less than 1% of all demolitions are by implosions.

[Speaker 4] (1:15:02 - 1:15:06)
So the last one that you're referring to is what?

[Speaker 6] (1:15:08 - 1:15:13)
The one by Hilco.

[Speaker 4] (1:15:15 - 1:15:38)
The Hilco demolition, correct? Yes. So if I may ask, I've tried to find it in the ordinance.

What are the violations for failure to act, either on the contractor or the property owner, when such a demolition is allowed to proceed and the metrics are not met in this ordinance?

[Speaker 6] (1:15:40 - 1:15:46)
To probably go back, law may know better, but I would think that it goes back to the various parts of the municipal code.

[Speaker 4] (1:15:48 - 1:16:19)
Well, I mean, we're talking about it, and forgive me, Commissioner, we're talking about a brand new consortium to create the multi-agency regulation for implosions. So are we relying on a singular agency then to be responsible for issuing violations against a multi-agency policy? Or should there be a more consistent overarching umbrella-type violation, considering that this is an overarching umbrella-type ordinance?

[Speaker 6] (1:16:20 - 1:16:38)
That's something we could obviously look at. Right now, if you were to violate one of the environmental portions of the rules, that violation would be dictated by the environmental code. If you violated one of the water sections, that would be dictated by the code that addresses water.

[Speaker 4] (1:16:39 - 1:16:55)
And the laws as of right now, the seven departments that are involved in this multi-agency task force, do they all have ordinances and regulations that cover implosion demolitions currently?

[Speaker 6] (1:16:58 - 1:17:00)
Well, certain ones would.

[Speaker 4] (1:17:02 - 1:17:04)
I could go one by one if it's easier.

[Speaker 6] (1:17:05 - 1:17:17)
I don't know if it deals specifically with implosions, but it would deal with the aspects that deal with implosions. Again, if you don't have the proper environmental protections, that would be an environmental issue.

[Speaker 4] (1:17:18 - 1:17:47)
Okay. Then perhaps, Chairman, I can ask individually, I'll let Matt off the hot seat. I know Matt, the commissioner and the Department of Buildings has implosion regulations because it's the Department of Buildings.

But if I could ask BACP, do they have regulations in effect right now that deal with the implosion demolitions? And I'm going to go down the list. So if everyone wants to just get their answer ready, I'd appreciate it.

[Speaker 22] (1:17:47 - 1:18:14)
Sure. Good morning. Matthew Alley on behalf of Commissioner Escorino from the Department of Business Affairs.

BACP merely licenses the companies that conduct this activity. So they would simply need to abide by our licensing process with the necessary inspections. We do not have rules in place at this time, but we'll certainly discuss with the other departments as a part of this ordinance, and then we'll put them in place through those conversations.

[Speaker 4] (1:18:15 - 1:18:17)
So as of right now, the short answer is no. Correct.

[Speaker 22] (1:18:18 - 1:18:19)
There are no rules.

[Speaker 4] (1:18:19 - 1:18:24)
No. Thank you. Fire Department, Commissioner Ford.

[Speaker 30] (1:18:27 - 1:18:28)
Good morning, Alderman. How are you doing?

[Speaker 4] (1:18:29 - 1:18:31)
I'm well, Commissioner. And thank you, by the way.

[Speaker 30] (1:18:31 - 1:18:39)
No, we do not. We do control pyrotechnics. However, I do believe it's CDOT who has power over a Class A, Class B explosive.

[Speaker 4] (1:18:40 - 1:18:44)
Okay. Thank you, Commissioner. Dr. Arwady, Commissioner.

[Speaker 59] (1:18:47 - 1:18:48)
Sure. Good morning. Can you hear me?

[Speaker 4] (1:18:49 - 1:18:50)
Good morning, Commissioner.

[Speaker 59] (1:18:50 - 1:18:50)
Good morning.

[Speaker 4] (1:18:51 - 1:18:52)
So about something other than COVID.

[Speaker 59] (1:18:52 - 1:19:20)
Yeah, I know. Occasionally it happens. So because an implosion is a type of demolition, the same ability that the health department has where there are problems found in an implosion would also apply as they would for any demolition.

So if, for example, we found that there were problems, people were not properly removing regulated materials, lead and asbestos, if there were issues with fugitive dust mitigation, etc., we have and can enforce those requirements.

[Speaker 4] (1:19:21 - 1:19:22)
Awesome. Thank you, Commissioner.

[Speaker 1] (1:19:25 - 1:19:42)
Let me interrupt for a second. Commissioner Arwady, Alderman Lopez had asked about punitive or financial fines. Can you comment on that in regards to environmental standards that were not met?

Sure.

[Speaker 59] (1:19:42 - 1:20:32)
So it really depends on what the violation is, but there's a range depending on how egregious a violation is. For bad situations, we definitely find sort of at that max. There's details that are available in the ordinance and rules that we can get back if you're interested on that.

I think what this ordinance is about is really putting in process some more coordination and some more ability to make sure that we review implosions separate from what is already in place for the demolition process, recognizing that they are a larger event, probably require additional coordination. But we can get back through the chair, if you like, the details of the ranges of fines that are already in place for the different violations. But it really just depends on what the violation is.

[Speaker 1] (1:20:33 - 1:20:50)
Thank you, Commissioner. And I will publicly thank you for your leadership on the COVID response. So we made the right choice when we put you as health commissioner last fall.

Thank you. Alderman Mike Rodriguez.

[Speaker 4] (1:20:50 - 1:20:51)
Actually, Chairman, I wasn't finished yet.

[Speaker 1] (1:20:52 - 1:20:54)
I'm sorry. Raymond, continue.

[Speaker 4] (1:20:54 - 1:21:07)
Thank you, Chairman. And yes, Commissioner already, I would love if you could provide through the chair, the range of the violations and the fines and fees associated with them, please. Thank you.

Mike Simon. I see that.

[Speaker 42] (1:21:08 - 1:21:40)
Hi, Alderman. This is Deputy Commissioner Mike Simon representing Commissioner Biagi for the Department of Transportation. The role of Chicago Department of Transportation is the right away permits.

And our policy regarding implosions is online regarding OUC submittals to ensure that the underground utilities are protected during the implosion. We work with all agencies that are impacted the public right away. And this is our day to day functions with any type of permitting function.

[Speaker 4] (1:21:40 - 1:21:57)
Thank you. And would, are your regulations with regards to the OECD underground work, separate and distinct when it comes to the demolition and implosions? Or are they all just kind of the same general violation fines?

[Speaker 42] (1:21:58 - 1:22:11)
We have it posted online for implosions. Because again, there's very few implosions that take place in, but it probably should be codified in rules and regulations, but it is posted online as a, as a policy.

[Speaker 4] (1:22:12 - 1:22:19)
Chairman, if we could get that provided through the chair as well, so that we can have that for all the members to see, I would appreciate that.

[Speaker 56] (1:22:19 - 1:22:20)
We'll do.

[Speaker 4] (1:22:21 - 1:22:25)
And lastly, Director Guidus for OEMC.

[Speaker 43] (1:22:26 - 1:22:46)
Good morning, Alderman. I mean, our responsibility in regards to this is communication coordination, basically oversee the process and treat it as a major event. So just making sure the communication process and notification process is up to our standards.

And again, treat it as a major event.

[Speaker 4] (1:22:47 - 1:22:59)
So director, if the contractor or the owner failed to adequately communicate, and I'm assuming you mean communication both internally and externally, or is this just an internal reference?

[Speaker 43] (1:23:00 - 1:23:02)
No, internally and externally.

[Speaker 4] (1:23:02 - 1:23:17)
So what would be, do we have violations and regulate and regulations for fines and things if they fail to properly notify externally with regards to demolitions and implosions currently?

[Speaker 43] (1:23:20 - 1:23:26)
And I'm sorry, Alderman, it was coming, you came in a little bit in periodic steps on this thing.

[Speaker 4] (1:23:26 - 1:23:47)
I'll repeat. Does OEMC have regulations as well as for violations and citations for companies, contractors and what, who would do demolitions and implosions and fail to properly notify our external individuals, our residents and aldermen and things of that nature?

[Speaker 43] (1:23:47 - 1:24:19)
Yeah, we would be working within the confines of other agencies, jurisdictions, ordinances, based on what was required by our, our other city agencies. And I would be looking for a sign off from each one of those agencies before we give it a green light and it includes the community process as well. So forgive me.

[Speaker 4] (1:24:19 - 1:24:31)
So OEMC, just so I'm clear, does not have its own set of regulations for external communications. It's just relying on, at this point, transportation, health and buildings as of right now.

[Speaker 43] (1:24:31 - 1:25:05)
Well, for external communications, yeah, we would do, use all the tools within our, that are available to us. I mean, through whatever mechanisms, procedures, the way I read it is the company would be responsible for flaring the area. We could also contribute by doing a reverse 911 to the, to the area, whatever was needed to ensure that we communicate, the city communicated properly to the respected area.

And that is, and I'm not referring to the ordinance that's in force.

[Speaker 4] (1:25:05 - 1:25:22)
I'm referring to right now. So we have that. I just want to make sure I'm a hundred percent clear that right now you have an, you have a mechanism to hold people accountable for their, for their external communications to residents, or is that what we're looking forward to doing in this ordinance?

[Speaker 43] (1:25:23 - 1:25:50)
Well, I think anything that we've been a part of, or I've been a part of, or OEMC has been a part of, we would not give a green light to anything unless it was, unless we felt it was communicated properly. And I think that OEMC has a history of working closely with the alderman in that, in that respect. And certainly if it was something that I was uncomfortable with, I would make sure that that was brought to everybody's attention.

Thank you, sir.

[Speaker 4] (1:25:50 - 1:25:57)
Commissioner Conner or whomever from water.

[Speaker 70] (1:25:58 - 1:26:04)
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you. Good morning.

[Speaker 4] (1:26:06 - 1:26:36)
Shall I repeat the question? Yes, please. So what mechanism do you have?

What, forgive me, what mechanisms does water management have with regards to the implosion demolitions to ensuring that the requirements and requisites of law that are covered by your department are met and are enforced with the appropriate fines or fees or violations, if that even exists, does that exist first off? And do you have them?

[Speaker 70] (1:26:36 - 1:27:10)
So, so again, this is Randy Conner, commissioner of water management. There aren't necessarily any fines and fees that are attached, but because of the hydrant permit and the permit use for the soil protection, we do periodically check the site to ensure that they're following the guidelines and the plumbing code, as well as we work with the other departments as well as, as well as CDOT because they govern a public way. And if there is damage to our facility, then we will then repair that.

And then we will back charge the contractor for 803 damages and go after them to recoup that money.

[Speaker 4] (1:27:11 - 1:29:25)
Okay, perfect. Thank you, Christian. I bring all of this up because it seems to be chairman that we have like a patchwork now.

And while I'm a hundred percent in support of streamlining this process, I too share my colleagues' concerns about notice and inclusion, not only of Alderman, but of the entire community at large. You know, we, we've seen with Hilco, the disaster that befell the little village community, not once, but twice, especially after we were told that demolitions were coming to a halt and they started up again. That scene should never repeat itself.

And as I'm reading this ordinance, you mentioned that people have seven to 30 days for community notifications. I don't necessarily see that in section two items, A through, excuse me, B and C. And I'd like for the department to maybe clarify that for me, because when it says both for written and posted notice, yes, it says a thousand feet, owners and occupants, a thousand feet in Aldermanic notification, but it doesn't say a timeline.

It doesn't say within seven days of filing the application, or it doesn't say within 30 days of filing an application. It's just, it's, it's very, it's missing from these two sections in particular. And the only part that references any kind of timeline for notification is actually item G under section two, which deals with additional requirements regarding the various permits, but nothing as far as engaging the community in the overall process.

So I'd like to know from the department of building standpoint, why timelines for notification and note for written notice and posted notice are missing when informing the community of what's going to happen should be at the very, very forefront of these kinds of decisions.

[Speaker 1] (1:29:28 - 1:29:32)
Matt, Matt, you want to answer the question, please? Yes, Alderman.

[Speaker 6] (1:29:32 - 1:29:56)
I think if you reading the ordinance as a whole written notice is required to, to, they need to have proof of written notice to all the residents within a hundred feet of the property line as part of their application. So before they even file their application, they need to notify the community and that's included in, in the, with their application.

[Speaker 4] (1:29:56 - 1:30:08)
But the question is by when? So sending out a letter on Monday and filing on Tuesday is not necessarily what I would consider transparent and open community notification.

[Speaker 6] (1:30:09 - 1:30:34)
That's 90 days out from the, from the application. And then throughout the, throughout the process there, they would have their public notification plan, which would be reviewed and that would detail more notification. They would have the public meeting.

They would have the OEMC has the option to require additional notices. So it's, it's multi multiple notifications throughout the process.

[Speaker 4] (1:30:35 - 1:30:41)
So where in this ordinance does it say they have to give notification 90 days in advance of making their application?

[Speaker 6] (1:30:42 - 1:30:53)
No, not 90 days in advance of making the application. When the application is made, they have to have their, they have to have their notice to the community as part of that application.

[Speaker 4] (1:30:54 - 1:31:05)
Correct. Which my question is what is to stop them from sending a certified letter out on Monday and then applying Tuesday?

[Speaker 6] (1:31:07 - 1:31:10)
It's still be 90 days out. So they would know that 90 days.

[Speaker 4] (1:31:11 - 1:31:15)
You're referring to 90 days out from the end of the application process?

[Speaker 6] (1:31:16 - 1:31:18)
No, 90 days from the application date.

[Speaker 4] (1:31:23 - 1:31:26)
So they have to give notice 90 days before applying?

[Speaker 71] (1:31:27 - 1:31:28)
No, sir.

[Speaker 1] (1:31:29 - 1:31:47)
Once the date of application, what am I missing? Well, I, if I'm, if I'm hearing it, correct, Matt. Yes.

It's nine. If someone applies today for this implosion, they, the minimum would be 90 days henceforth. Is that correct?

[Speaker 6] (1:31:47 - 1:31:49)
Correct. Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 25] (1:31:50 - 1:31:50)
That's correct.

[Speaker 6] (1:31:51 - 1:31:52)
Right. Right.

[Speaker 25] (1:31:52 - 1:31:55)
And I, and Chairman, I believe I understand that.

[Speaker 4] (1:31:57 - 1:32:45)
It's 90 days from the time you apply at minimum to finality of the resolution of the, of the application, right? Correct. I'm not talking about that.

I'm talking about before you apply, not just saying once the application is in, you've got 90 days to try and argue and convince Alderman and City Hall bureaucrats to say, no, why are we not giving more people time before people even apply for this? Particularly because it is such a huge event for a neighborhood. Why not require that you must give 30 days notice before you even begin the application process to ensure that individuals are made, have plenty of time locally to discuss this?

That is my question.

[Speaker 6] (1:32:46 - 1:32:54)
Okay. I just think it's, it's consistent with the other provisions in the code where you, you give notice when you file.

[Speaker 4] (1:32:55 - 1:33:43)
But this is not like just any other situation in the city of Chicago. And when things go wrong, as we saw, they did during the last one, it has a huge impact. And I think that we should understand the gravity of what we're discussing.

And I think there's a reason why they don't happen that often. And hopefully they don't happen that often moving forward. But this is a huge event, which you said other municipalities recognize as a huge event.

So I don't think we should just treat this as just another city process. It's not just the zoning change. This is a huge event in the city of Chicago.

And I think that it would be well wise for us as a city to give as much notification and get as much community input as possible so that everyone knows what's going to go down in their neighborhood. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:33:44 - 1:33:49)
All right. So that's a good segue into Alderman Mike Rodriguez.

[Speaker 9] (1:33:50 - 1:34:26)
How I do things. Thank you, Chairman. Thank you, Alderman as well.

Good segue. I have a number of questions, many of which matter related to rules. I'm assuming that you're able to comment.

Because I think a lot of the stuff that's baked here in this ordinance are essentially I mean, essentially, this is an enabling ordinance, right? That mandates commissioners put together rules. Is that correct?

[Speaker 6] (1:34:26 - 1:34:28)
That's correct. Okay.

[Speaker 9] (1:34:30 - 1:35:05)
And I think the ordinance lays out some of the timeframes that are important to notify the neighbors and the community in general. I'm wondering on the rules and the creation of rules by each commissioner. How are we going to engage community leaders and environmentalists residents in that process?

Is there a commitment to engage neighbors and community in the rules making process?

[Speaker 6] (1:35:07 - 1:36:48)
Yes, Alderman. That's a great question. So the process we're following here is the really the same process followed by the state in the Illinois Administrative Procedures Act, where a lot of state agencies I used to work with the state.

We post the rules are posted online or in the state journal and then interests of parties have X number of days to submit public comment. And it's during that public comment process where a lot of individuals, community groups, scientific groups will raise some very good points. And that's that allows the departments to take that into consideration.

And in most instances in the state of the federal system, the rules are changed through that process. I think a lot of these rules are going to be, some can be very technical and very scientific that will need to be hashed through. We welcome any group that wishes to make comment.

We encourage any group to make comments. We would welcome as many comments as we can get. I've done the rulemaking process where I've gotten zero comments.

I've done process where I've gotten a hundred comments. And I prefer the latter personally, because I do want the input. And I think my colleagues would welcome the input of the community and advocacy groups.

Could you explain further? We're hoping that that's the process that comes out that we'll put some rules out and we'll get some great input from the community and from various groups. And we'll move forward from there and we'll have even better rules.

[Speaker 9] (1:36:49 - 1:37:01)
And I just want to be clear about the rulemaking process. So how do you alert the public of the written rules that have requested comment?

[Speaker 6] (1:37:03 - 1:37:25)
I know the building department is a very robust outreach program through our social media and through our own web. And we would join with the other departments in getting the word out too. We certainly work with your respective offices to get the word out.

And the best we can get the word out, the better comments we're going to receive.

[Speaker 9] (1:37:26 - 1:38:19)
Particularly on this issue. So I reached out to my environmental group in my community to give me thoughts on this ordinance. And the biggest issue was on the rules making process.

I mean, this ordinance sounds decent. I'll be supportive of it. It does include some things that I wish were in place April 10th.

But with that being said, and that they weren't, and after an absolutely tragic situation in my neighborhood, not just my ward, but five blocks from where I live, I think people are going to have a lot of interest on these rules, particularly how they impact them. So I just heard you make a commitment to me that you would reach out to my office when buildings comes up for their rules making comments.

[Speaker 6] (1:38:20 - 1:38:23)
Yes, I'm happy to reach out to every every member of the council.

[Speaker 9] (1:38:24 - 1:39:03)
Okay. That'll be important because I think each of these rules now there's a number of different departments that we making rules on this issue. I think the buildings is probably the most important when it comes to this.

But I think I like to hear as my colleague did from the other agencies that commitment to reach out during the rules process. Can I go to the others in any order? Maybe we can go to CDPH.

[Speaker 12] (1:39:10 - 1:39:33)
Hello, this is Megan Cunningham, Managing Deputy Commissioner for Strategy and Development. I believe Dr. R. Witte had to jump off a bit earlier.

So yes, CDPH would certainly make the commitment to engage with all dramatic offices. I believe that the ordinance is drafted also permits departments to host public meetings. So we could have discussions about incorporating that into our rules making process as well.

[Speaker 9] (1:39:34 - 1:39:50)
Yeah, I think the ordinance states that may hold a public hearing, if you will, the language is really weird. I'm assuming that has to do with COVID-19. And, and potentially having those public meetings online.

Is that your understanding? And forgive me, is that Megan?

[Speaker 12] (1:39:51 - 1:40:11)
That's Megan. Yes. That may be a provision anticipating virtual engagement as opposed to in person dependent on COVID.

But I think, you know, we are interested in public outreach in all its various forms. So accepting written comment and exploring opportunities for direct opportunities to hear from residents as well.

[Speaker 17] (1:40:11 - 1:40:12)
Thank you, Megan. Water.

[Speaker 71] (1:40:19 - 1:40:23)
I'm sorry, I'm having some some connection difficulties. Can you repeat that?

[Speaker 9] (1:40:23 - 1:40:49)
Forgive me, Commissioner Connor. In the rulesmaking process, I want a commitment from each of the Commissioner, each of the agencies to alert aldermen when they begin the rules process, and in what manner they're going to be doing so and receiving public comment.

[Speaker 70] (1:40:53 - 1:41:02)
Absolutely, we can give you that commitment. Again, we work through the Department of Buildings and give them all of our comments, but we can definitely work with definitely do that for you.

[Speaker 43] (1:41:03 - 1:41:19)
Okay. OEMC. Yes, aldermen, we're committed to working, certainly ensuring that communication is done accordingly.

Okay, who else? I think I'm missing two or three.

[Speaker 30] (1:41:22 - 1:41:40)
Well, aldermen, FHIR, of course, would be willing to, as we have in the past, work with our other city departments to create rules and contact and get those rules out to all the aldermen as needed. For comment before they're finalized, correct?

[Speaker 9] (1:41:40 - 1:41:44)
Yes, sir. Okay, thank you. Anybody else?

[Speaker 22] (1:41:45 - 1:41:54)
Alderman Matthew Alley from BACP. BACP would make that commitment as well to engage with aldermanic offices as we begin our drafting process and before they're finalized.

[Speaker 9] (1:41:56 - 1:42:23)
Thank you. Okay, just a couple more questions, and Chair, please indulge me. I won't be long.

Back to Matt. I just want to be clear. Does the city in this ordinance reserve the right to prohibit an implosion if it's not consistent with public health, safety, or the welfare of residents in the immediate community?

[Speaker 6] (1:42:24 - 1:42:37)
I would say yes, if they don't meet the various requirements of the different departments. If one department says it's not meeting our standards, I believe the other departments will follow.

[Speaker 9] (1:42:38 - 1:42:51)
Okay, and could you briefly go over the statement of hazards? I don't see a specificity in this ordinance around the hazards.

[Speaker 6] (1:42:53 - 1:43:28)
Well, I think hazard would be within the subject matter of the various departments. For instance, buildings, we would need to know where the structure was going to fall. If it plans to fall in an area that would hit a car or hit a house, that obviously wouldn't be our satisfaction.

Environment would have its own, or health would have its own hazards. Water would have its own hazards. Is it going to damage the sewer system?

[Speaker 9] (1:43:29 - 1:44:02)
So I think it's hazard would be defined by each various department. And I wanted to, for clarity's sake, I heard you say notification. I think it's written in the ordinance that's 1,000 feet from the property line.

I heard you say 100 feet earlier. Just for clarification, would you- Oh, no, I'm sorry. It would be 1,000 feet if I'm, I apologize if I misspoke, but it is 1,000.

1,000 feet from the property line. And it's from the property line, which essentially is around four city blocks. And is that in each direction?

What's the assumption there?

[Speaker 6] (1:44:02 - 1:44:21)
It would be in each direction. And some city blocks are longer than others, but it would be 1,000 feet from the property, respective property lines. Not 1,000 feet from the implosion site, which if you're on a bigger lot, you would shrink the notice.

But we want the notice to be as far as we can. So we use 1,000 feet from the property line. So there's no confusion.

[Speaker 9] (1:44:23 - 1:44:37)
And the community meetings that are outlined here, I understand they're very specific timelines around date and times of those public meetings and the length of time before the actual implosion. Could you go over that one last time, please?

[Speaker 6] (1:44:38 - 1:45:00)
Sure. So there'd be required, a public meeting would have to be hosted at the expense of the of the applicant. There'd need to be at least two, within two miles of the site.

And might have to accommodate at least 50 public attendees and a minimum of two hours of public questions.

[Speaker 9] (1:45:01 - 1:45:04)
And then when is that meeting supposed to occur?

[Speaker 6] (1:45:05 - 1:45:10)
There would be no less than 60 days, no more than 30 days after the application has been filed.

[Speaker 9] (1:45:10 - 1:45:20)
After the application has been filed. And my colleague, Alderman Lopez, I think he got out of view that that application process typically takes around 90 days.

[Speaker 6] (1:45:21 - 1:45:29)
Well, it's 90 days out from the, a minimum of 90 days out from the filing the application.

[Speaker 9] (1:45:30 - 1:45:51)
Okay. So then a month to two months after the application, there would need to be a community meeting. That's correct.

Okay. Is there any mandate that before the application is inserted that there's any engagement before the application? I just wanted to reiterate the previous question.

Yeah.

[Speaker 6] (1:45:52 - 1:46:08)
Not currently, but we're each going to be allowed to do our various rules. So that's something we could look at in the rules if we deem that to be appropriate. Point of information, Chairman.

Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 4] (1:46:10 - 1:46:48)
Point of information, Alderman Lopez. Forgive me, Alderman Rodriguez, but is there anything that would preclude us from including in the application process that Aldermanic notification or community notification must be included at the time of proof of contact be included as we do for many of the other applications that people file, that they've given notice or that they've had discussions with local aldermen and people? Is there anything that would stop us from doing that in this ordinance?

[Speaker 6] (1:46:52 - 1:47:00)
I don't believe so. The ordinance does say that at the time of application, they have to have, they need to include their proof of notification.

[Speaker 1] (1:47:01 - 1:47:09)
I think the question was approval from notification needs to be sent to the individual alderman. Where is that in the ordinance?

[Speaker 4] (1:47:11 - 1:47:44)
As part of the application process. I think to Alderman Rodriguez's point, you know, if you have a 90 day window before the event, the demolition, that gives you so much leeway leading up to an event when the train has already left the station. And I want to ask to my point of information, how do you ensure the front end work happens so that it's not midway through as they're already buying the water cannons for demolition?

Thank you, Chairman. However you wish to answer that. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:47:47 - 1:47:51)
Matt, Aldermanic notification at what point in the process?

[Speaker 6] (1:47:57 - 1:47:59)
I believe it's at the time of the application.

[Speaker 1] (1:48:00 - 1:48:04)
Do you want to make sure? It's not in the rules, I think it's in the ordinance.

[Speaker 6] (1:48:06 - 1:48:31)
I'm just doubling down. The application shall include evidence that the applicant mailed written notice to the owners and occupants of all buildings located within 1,000 feet of the property line of the zoning lot where explosions will be used and to the alderman of the ward in which the zoning lot is located. So at the time of application, the alderman would be notified.

[Speaker 1] (1:48:35 - 1:48:48)
Well, wait a second. Wait a second now. Alderman Lopez, I think he answered your question.

That was your point of information. First one, I have a second point. No, well, let me go back to Alderman Rodriguez.

Alderman Rodriguez.

[Speaker 9] (1:48:48 - 1:49:24)
Thank you. I think that I'm almost done. Just back to the rules, I just want to thank everyone for their commitment to aldermanic engagements and then also community engagement in the rules process, because I think this ordinance is one where the rules is going to be very, very important.

And I'm going to want some of the people close to this to be at that table and make sure that we have as much comment as possible there. I think that was my last question. So I'll give you back the fourth term.

And thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:49:24 - 1:49:28)
Thank you. Alderman Lopez, quickly on a second point of information.

[Speaker 4] (1:49:30 - 1:50:22)
Jump back in my seat. Sorry. So my second point of information is related to the first one, which is there are a number of applications that we have that are submitted by many of the inter agencies, the other agencies involved in this multi-agency ordinance that require an alderman's signature to be present as being notified, not just proof of notification, but you physically have to get the alderman's signature on the application. What would preclude that from being included in this particular ordinance, or if an alderman refuses to sign off on the public way permits that would also be a part of this multi-agency regulation, would that be enough to stop or slow down this process?

[Speaker 1] (1:50:24 - 1:51:30)
And I think that's not a point of information. That's a point of criticism that you're making. For many of us, we have demos, not as important as implosions, but we get notice on any demo in the alderman's office.

And I think we don't sign off on every demo, but we do get notice. So I hope for the sake of the city, that as Matt said in his earlier testimony, that this is hopefully a once in a lifetime event. And we've got to, with passage of the ordinance, I think we're moving in the direction.

But there is, listening to the individual department heads and Matt, notice is part of the ordinance. And I know how important it is for the alderman to have knowledge of everything going on in their ward. I'm comfortable.

Hopefully we don't ever have to enact this in our lifetime. But I want to move to Alderman Sitio Lopez.

[Speaker 3] (1:51:33 - 1:53:07)
Thank you, Chairman. And yeah, I think indeed it is extremely important that we are aware not only of what's happening, but also have some kind of leverage, right? If we identify something wrong.

My question is in terms of like the recent, of course, as recent as a few months ago, there was a public meeting. I heard differently than what maybe the administration heard, but I heard that the community wanted to halt the demolition. That didn't happen.

So how do we enforce this? You know, how do we, if a public meeting, right, says, well, we need to stop this, right? Who makes the final decision, right?

If as an impact study, right? And it says, well, look, there's risks involved. How do we measure these public risks?

How do we make sure that it is the results of the public meeting and the impact study that guides the decision? Because my experience so far, unfortunately, has been that, you know, we may have different results in public meetings, but yet, you know, that's what I'm a little shaking today. I'm really surprised about some decisions that are made.

So what guarantee is that we are going to follow the will of the community? And that's the first part of the question. The other part is how we enforce this, right?

I know that, and I heard Commissioner Waddy, right, of course, willing to help out. And that's great. My issue is obviously the matter of capacity, right?

I know that we have a Department of the Environment that was promised that we need to somehow reinstate, because my risk is on how do we enforce this, right? So those are the two questions.

[Speaker 1] (1:53:07 - 1:53:13)
Thank you, Alderman. Can we get a response to Alderman Sito Lopez's two questions, please?

[Speaker 63] (1:53:18 - 1:54:16)
I'm sure. This is Dave Graham with Public Health. I apologize.

You know, moving forward in this particular situation, in a future implosion, we will not be moving forward until we get all of those things that we need that are outlined in this ordinance and then our future rules. So, you know, unfortunately, with some things that happen halfway through, things become dangerous. So the intent is that as we move forward, before there's actually a permit is issued, we're going to have, or during the permitting process, we're going to make sure that all of the concerns that we have and from the public that they're addressed as possible, as necessary.

[Speaker 1] (1:54:17 - 1:54:31)
Now, the other question was, if there was obviously consternation, there's a dispute. At the end of the day, Matt, I would think the Building Commissioner signs off on the demo, or on the implosion.

[Speaker 6] (1:54:31 - 1:54:41)
Well, we would sign off on the implosion permit. But as my colleague said, there's various pieces of that. So if the dust mitigation plan doesn't get approved.

[Speaker 1] (1:54:41 - 1:54:55)
I think that answers Alderman Siccio-Lopez's question about, at the end of the day, it's the Building Commissioner that makes that decision in consort with all these other agencies, notice to the community, community meetings, and automatic input.

[Speaker 6] (1:54:56 - 1:55:09)
That's correct. We'd probably be the last piece of the puzzle. But I do want to stress that this ordinance, what is having OEMC as a quarterback.

So we do have a coordinating body over the various departments that have a role in this.

[Speaker 1] (1:55:10 - 1:55:35)
Okay. Alderman Siccio-Lopez, do you have one last question on this? Because we've got a couple more hours.

Yeah, no, no. And get back to Pilsen. Good, I'm good.

Alderman Bryan? Bryan Hopkins, you're up. Can you hear me?

We can hear you, Bryan.

[Speaker 26] (1:55:36 - 1:55:46)
We can also hear your child. Okay, yeah, I know, I know. Yeah, just, I know it's been asked more or less in two or three different methods, but...

[Speaker 71] (1:55:46 - 1:55:47)
It's my turn!

[Speaker 26] (1:55:47 - 1:56:36)
Yeah, it's your turn. It's my turn. It seems that this ordinance goes all the way up to the line of actually granting aldermanic authority, and then just stops there.

So someone who's drafted this ordinance could explain why not just take that next step? Given everything that happened in the Hillcrest situation, it just seems to me it makes the most sense from all perspectives, both the executive and the legislative branch and the internal departments, to have the alderman clearly on the record, not just involved in it, but authorizing it. And we go almost to that point and then just stop short with this ordinance.

So I was wondering if someone could just explain the justification for that decision.

[Speaker 1] (1:56:39 - 1:57:18)
Matt, do you want to talk about... Let me just say from my own perspective, as previous speakers have talked about, these implosions and demolitions are a science in and of themselves and an engineering feat. I'm not sure as the local alderman I want to be signing off on something where I am not entirely schooled to make that decision, but I rely on the consortium of departments to help steer this process.

So Brian, I'm not sure I would want to have that final say off, but could you elaborate on more, Matt? Sure.

[Speaker 6] (1:57:18 - 1:57:36)
This is consistent, as Chairman Tony said, with the other demolition permits. Do buildings check all the boxes for having a permit issued? Are they following the code?

And if yes, then we are obliged to issue a permit.

[Speaker 26] (1:57:41 - 1:58:30)
Okay. And I appreciate your comments, Chairman. We're not experts in many things that we're required to authorize one way or another.

And I'm sure Alderman Rodriguez could attest to the fact that the residents of our ward typically don't really accept as an excuse, oh, I didn't have that authority. It was somebody else's decision. They expect us to be making decisions on all manner of things.

And if we're not experts on it, we do rely on those who are in order to make those decisions. And I would think this would be just one other element of our job, you know, that the residents expect us to get up to speed quickly and to make an informed and intelligent decision on their behalf. So thank you.

That's my only comment.

[Speaker 1] (1:58:30 - 1:58:47)
Thank you, Alderman. I see a future Alderman in that background. I hear a future Alderman there.

So I don't have any further questions from committee members. Do I hear a motion to pass this item on the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 15] (1:58:47 - 1:58:49)
So moved by Alderman David Moore.

[Speaker 1] (1:58:50 - 2:00:10)
Alderman David Moore moves to pass. I want to be recorded as voting no, Mr. Chairman. Okay, all those in favor.

And any opposed in addition to the record shows that Alderman Tony Beal is a no. Okay, so with that, we're going to be in the opinion of the chair of the ayes have it. And the item is passed with the note of Alderman Beal voting no.

All right, now we're moving on to TAD-600 introduced by Alderman Riley on 6-17-20. The amendment of the municipal code 7-4-17-4 by adding new section 17-4-1100 to establish requirements for roll up overhead or sliding security gates or doors. It's my understanding we have a substitute on this matter.

Can I get a motion to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? So moved, Chairman. Alderman Lopez.

Alderman Lopez moves to accept the substitute. All those in favor. Aye.

Any opposed?

[Speaker 5] (2:00:11 - 2:00:11)
Can you say aye?

[Speaker 1] (2:00:12 - 2:00:15)
Opinion two, the ayes have it, substitutes before us. Alderman Riley.

[Speaker 5] (2:00:16 - 2:04:38)
Thank you, Chairman and colleagues. This is a pretty simple ordinance. It was introduced at the request of the Chicago Loop Alliance, which is the business association and delegate agency for SSA number one in the loop.

And what the ordinance would do would only apply to de-zoning districts, so downtown zoning districts only. But any roll up overhead or sliding security door gate installed after July 30th of this year for ground floor retail or commercial uses located in any building in a de-zoning district must be located inside of any storefront window, be clear and non-reflective, allowing views of indoor commercial space or product display areas, and three, comply with any transparency requirements, including section 17-4-504C or the terms of any plan development ordinance as applicable. And this ordinance would take effect upon passage and publication, obviously grandfathering in all pre-existing rolling gates that are in place by July 30th of this year. The purpose for the ordinance, and I also have a letter of support from the head of the Chicago Loop Alliance, Michael Edwards, which I will tender to the committee.

He was unable to testify today because he's out of town. But I think people remember back in the 80s, State Street, Wabash, and other commercial quarters in the loop had these steel or iron roll down doors for security. And of course we want our shopkeepers to be able to secure their storefronts.

But the aesthetic implication was that when these roll up doors were secured, literally blocks upon blocks of the loop looked as if it was abandoned. And that's not the message that we're trying to send to tourists and visitors and future investors in our property in the loop. We want people to know that we're open for business.

And so this was brought to me by the business people and landlords who are in the loop to try and ensure some kind of aesthetic continuity. I'm informed that the solutions that this ordinance would require are competitive, meaning that there are many options. They're price comparative to the steel gates, but they allow people to see in and out of the storefronts.

And many store owners keep their storefronts lit in the evening. And so for pedestrians who are traversing the downtown area overnight, having that extra light, the access to the security cameras inside of those stores for more eyes on the street, literally, I think is important. And so this is something that I've gotten a number of emails and phone calls in support of.

I think it'll help preserve all the great progress that we've made in the loop and downtown, improving the aesthetic and making it more of a 24-hour destination, rather than a location that is closed for business at 6 p.m., which used to be the norm in the Chicago loop. So this is really an ordinance that was brought to me by members of the community. It makes good sense to me.

I think it promotes public safety. It promotes the aesthetic. As you all know, we have a lot of historic and landmark structures and facades along State and Wabash streets.

That's really the quarter that we're trying to focus on here. That's where there's a preponderance of these types of gates. And where, frankly, we've had a lot of smash and grab incidents over the last several weeks, which are completely unacceptable.

And then, as we all know, at the end of May, there were riots and looting that occurred on a grand scale downtown. And so retailers are inclined to take extra precautions to secure their storefronts, their investment, their merchandise. But we want to do it in a way that preserves the aesthetic and also helps to contribute towards the safety of pedestrians in the area when those businesses are closed.

I'd be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (2:04:38 - 2:04:45)
All right. Thank you, Alderman Riley. We have Alderman Ray Lopez with a question.

[Speaker 4] (2:04:46 - 2:05:09)
Thank you, Chairman. And thank you, Alderman Riley, for this ordinance. My question, actually, would be, why is this only limited to the loop?

Why is it not something that could be applied citywide for many areas? Like Back of the Yards, for example, where Alderman Taylor and I have, Ashland Avenue looks exactly how you described it, like it's closed. Why is this not a citywide issue?

[Speaker 5] (2:05:09 - 2:06:15)
Sure, Alderman. Thank you for the question. As I do often, I try not to impose a policy that seems good for the Central Business District on the entire city, just out of sensitivity for my colleagues and out of respect for your wards.

But I know that the Legislative Reference Bureau would be happy to assist you and our colleagues in applying this more broadly with a follow-up ordinance. And I'd be certainly happy to help in that effort. But my immediate purpose is to get this in place for the Central Business District, those de-zoning districts, where there's a lot of this refitting of storefronts going on right now.

So we're going to give folks till the end of the month to put in and install whatever devices they've already selected. But after that point, we're going to ask them to select a product that is transparent. But if that's something that you want to pursue for your wards and commercial corridors, please work with Mike Hallett and his team at LRB.

They'll be happy to draft an ordinance. And I'd support it, of course.

[Speaker 1] (2:06:16 - 2:06:19)
Thank you, Chairman. Alderman David Moore.

[Speaker 15] (2:06:21 - 2:06:43)
Yeah, it was sort of along those same lines. So let me stick to that one before I go to mine. But let me go to the first one.

So right now, the ordinance has in there, in terms of gates and stuff, what is the ordinance now in terms of it? They can put anything they want. They can put the sliding doors and all of that right now.

[Speaker 5] (2:06:44 - 2:07:02)
So long as they have a permit, so long as they have a permit, Alderman, they can install whatever sort of security gate they would like. So this actually tightens those regulations to ensure that whatever they're installing is at least transparent on the storefront.

[Speaker 15] (2:07:03 - 2:07:31)
Right. And then, okay, thank you. And then so too, which is going to be my second question, which Alderman Lopez brought up, and I appreciate what you said.

So instead of just passing two ordinances for the sake of everything, can this be amended to include certain wards? If certain words wanted to be included or otherwise, we're going to be passing ordinances for each separate ward, which I don't think is...

[Speaker 1] (2:07:34 - 2:09:00)
I think Alderman Riley has suggested that we could take a more holistic approach moving forward. Brendan, correct me if I'm wrong, you mentioned in your testimony that there's a lot of different ways to protect your storefront. Some are more expensive than others.

Some are less aesthetic than others. But moving forward in the D district, everything is grandfathered in. It's moving forward, correct?

And I think that being said, as a shop owner myself, this is not an inexpensive solution. And I think we need to study it if it's appropriate for your wards and maybe give downtown, that D district, a little bit of a couple of months to figure out how it works. So I want to commend Alderman Riley for being sensitive to the downtown district.

But I think the whole affordability issue could be taken on a case-by-case basis. So as he said, council is Wednesday. If we as a body, if I could make it citywide, I think we still need a little bit more notification to all the property owners that this will be the new paradigm moving forward.

[Speaker 15] (2:09:01 - 2:09:11)
All right. Thank you, Chairman. And thank you, Alderman Riley.

We'll definitely utilize your staff to extend this into our wards. I appreciate it.

[Speaker 5] (2:09:11 - 2:09:46)
Thank you, Alderman. And by the way, LRB is all of our staff. They work for all of us and they'll be happy to help.

Oh, absolutely. And my guess is, Alderman, my guess is that they will suggest that we engage in a conversation with our colleagues that have commercial corridors and then probably look at the zoning classifications and find some commonality there so that they could draw a definition that captures the areas where you really want this to govern. But again, LRB will provide all the technical assistance that's needed to do that.

[Speaker 1] (2:09:46 - 2:09:49)
All right. Thank you. Thank you.

Thank you, Brendan. Alderman Walter Burnett.

[Speaker 11] (2:09:50 - 2:10:16)
Thank you, Chairman. So I have, of course, I have some of the D districts in my ward also. So Brendan, I want to know, so is this a competitive pricing?

Is the cost for this competitive for the store owners? And then also I want to know, how do you lock the gates from the inside?

[Speaker 5] (2:10:20 - 2:11:04)
So I'm not an expert on this material, but what I'm told by the Loop Alliance is that, yes, it is a competitive marketplace. So you can get competitive bids for these products. They are a bit more expensive than a traditional iron gate, but are price competitive.

As I understand it, most of the technology can be installed behind the shop windows. And it basically serves as almost an extra layer of see-through material that cannot be demolished. It's a thick plastic essentially.

And then with the storefront, with the actual door, you lock that plexi piece first and then the outer door second on your way out. Okay.

[Speaker 11] (2:11:05 - 2:11:21)
All right. So this is covering part of my ward and I don't know how my businesses feel about it. I know the Loop Alliance, have they spoken to other businesses and business organizations in the D districts?

[Speaker 5] (2:11:22 - 2:11:27)
I don't believe they've engaged with businesses in your ward, Alderman. And I apologize for that.

[Speaker 11] (2:11:34 - 2:11:41)
So I'm sure Brian had the same thing I have going on Michelle and Pat probably.

[Speaker 1] (2:11:45 - 2:11:46)
Okay.

[Speaker 15] (2:11:46 - 2:11:49)
Point of information. Point of it.

[Speaker 1] (2:11:49 - 2:12:05)
Okay. Alderman Burnett, I know we're going to hear from some of the other older women that have D districts. So I'm going to ask for them to ask their questions.

But before then, David, Alderman Moore.

[Speaker 15] (2:12:06 - 2:12:11)
Just quick. I just thought Alderman Riley said it was just in his ward.

[Speaker 5] (2:12:12 - 2:12:35)
No, I said it's in the D zoning districts. And my ward is 100% D zoning districts, but there are slivers of Alderman Burnett's ward, Hopkins, Dow, King and Smith that also have some D. But the vast predominance of D districts in the city zoning code is in the 42nd ward.

Thank you.

[Speaker 15] (2:12:35 - 2:12:35)
Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:12:35 - 2:12:39)
All right. Alderman, I think Sophia King was next. Alderman King.

[Speaker 66] (2:12:41 - 2:12:58)
Yep. Thank you, Chairman. Yeah, I guess I was going to ask a question in the same vein because I'm normally not on this.

I'm not on the committee. So I'm glad I'm here. But Alderman Riley, so this includes portions of my ward too?

[Speaker 5] (2:12:58 - 2:13:05)
If you have D districts in your ward, it would. It only applies to D zoning districts. D, X, B, C, D, R.

[Speaker 66] (2:13:06 - 2:13:10)
So I definitely do. Did you socialize it with businesses in my ward?

[Speaker 5] (2:13:11 - 2:13:13)
Not with businesses in your ward. No, Alderman.

[Speaker 66] (2:13:14 - 2:13:16)
Can you forward? Actually, no.

[Speaker 5] (2:13:16 - 2:13:25)
I take that back. Yes, we did socialize it with a business group that represents a portion of your ward, which is the Chicago Loop Alliance, who actually brought the proposal to me.

[Speaker 66] (2:13:26 - 2:13:32)
Right. So they didn't bring it to me. But can you email it to me right now?

I don't have a copy of it.

[Speaker 5] (2:13:33 - 2:13:34)
Sure.

[Speaker 1] (2:13:36 - 2:13:41)
Sophia, what is the email? We'll send it to your city email as we speak.

[Speaker 66] (2:13:42 - 2:13:44)
That would be great.

[Speaker 1] (2:13:45 - 2:13:48)
Okay. Is there another question, Alderman King?

[Speaker 66] (2:13:49 - 2:14:04)
No, just, you know. I know. I want to make sure my community is represented well.

We have a good portion of the district and part of downtown. Thank you, Alderman Dowell.

[Speaker 16] (2:14:05 - 2:14:23)
Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have a question for two questions for Alderman Riley.

Does this apply to stores of any size? I mean, there's no square footage definition here.

[Speaker 5] (2:14:24 - 2:14:30)
It applies to any storefront for retail frontage that is located in a de-zoning district.

[Speaker 16] (2:14:30 - 2:14:54)
Okay. So it could be a tiny store, could be Bloomingdale's. Okay.

So I have the same question that Alderman King has. The extent to which the Loop Alliance has had a discussion with the Near South Planning Board, which represents many of the de-zoned retail store owners in my ward.

[Speaker 5] (2:14:56 - 2:14:59)
I can't speak to what their outreach efforts were, Alderman.

[Speaker 16] (2:14:59 - 2:15:18)
Okay. Would you, as the sponsor for this ordinance, be willing to hold this to ask the Loop Alliance to socialize this a bit more with other de-zoned areas in the city?

[Speaker 5] (2:15:19 - 2:16:16)
Yeah, that's fine. I was just trying to get this done in an expedient manner because many people are currently outfitting their storefronts. And I think at a certain point in time, the opportunity or actually the necessity for this ordinance will have passed.

Again, it's not a mandate. We're not requiring people to install these security devices. It's those folks who elect to install a gate on their frontage.

This would be the kind of materiality they'd need to use. What vendor they use, which supplier, all that is up to them. And again, it's not a requirement to install it.

That's only if you choose to take that extra step to secure your storefront. I'd be shocked if people who represent other commercial quarters near downtown wouldn't want a better aesthetic option that doesn't make their neighborhood look like it's closed for business.

[Speaker 16] (2:16:16 - 2:16:28)
I'm not saying that they don't. But I would like to know that versus just assuming that if I'm being asked to vote on something that affects the businesses in my ward. That's all I'm saying.

[Speaker 5] (2:16:28 - 2:16:56)
Okay, well, my guess is without an August council, the cow will already be out of the barn. But I'm certainly not trying to ram this down anybody's throat. So if this ordinance is even worth pursuing in September, I guess we can call it up then.

The purpose here was to try and guard the aesthetic of the central business district and the loop. If that's not something we wanna do today, we'll hold it. But my guess is it probably won't be necessary in September.

[Speaker 1] (2:16:58 - 2:17:06)
So let me ask the wish of the committee members. So is it possible- You restate your request to Alderman Riley, please.

[Speaker 11] (2:17:08 - 2:17:45)
So Alderman Tunney and Alderman Riley, is there a way that we can do this and give Alderman an opt-out in their wards? Can we amend it and give Alderman an opt-out if they didn't want it? I mean, I don't know if my community- My community probably won it.

I think it's a good thing. I just don't know what the pricing is and how they- All them starving right now. I don't know what the dynamics is on that.

[Speaker 5] (2:17:47 - 2:17:56)
Is there a way that we can amend it in her ward? Is there someone here from the law department, Chairman?

[Speaker 11] (2:17:58 - 2:18:01)
That way Alderman Riley can still pass this.

[Speaker 5] (2:18:01 - 2:18:19)
If it's gone and then if we wanna be included- Yeah, because Chairman, my purpose is not to impose this on my colleagues. If they aren't comfortable with it yet, wanna learn more about it, I'd love for there to be a mechanism for them to exclude their areas until they feel better about it.

[Speaker 1] (2:18:20 - 2:18:24)
All right, thank you, Alderman Dowell.

[Speaker 16] (2:18:24 - 2:18:35)
Yeah, I have one other question. Does Alderman Riley's ordinance apply to businesses located in planned developments which may have an underlying de-zoning?

[Speaker 5] (2:18:36 - 2:18:55)
Yes, it does specifically apply to planned developments, but the more restrictive requirements apply. So if the PD has even more strict requirements for frontages and how they manage retail in that PD, that would supersede this ordinance.

[Speaker 29] (2:18:58 - 2:18:58)
Okay.

[Speaker 5] (2:18:59 - 2:19:05)
But as you know, Alderman Dowell, the vast majority of our PDs are de-districts, yeah.

[Speaker 1] (2:19:06 - 2:19:18)
All right, let me ask if Jeff Levine is available, do you wanna, maybe Alderman Riley would restate his question to Jeff Levine?

[Speaker 46] (2:19:19 - 2:19:22)
Good morning, Jeff Levine.

[Speaker 1] (2:19:22 - 2:19:23)
Good morning, Jeff.

[Speaker 46] (2:19:24 - 2:20:37)
Yeah, I heard the question. I think to do a ward-based opt-out is legally problematic. It is possible to do a more geographically targeted opt-out like designating a particular stretch that it does not apply to much like liquor moratoria.

However, I think that the essence of this has a kind of general applicability quality to it. And I think my recommendation would be to try to work out whatever, or I guess negate whatever business opposition there might be and pass it in its current form. I'm trying to think about whether there are any ways to pass it on Wednesday, but still allow for the kind of outreach time that Alderman Dowell was asking for.

I haven't come up with an idea yet, but I can keep thinking about that while the meeting goes on.

[Speaker 5] (2:20:40 - 2:21:49)
Chairman, if I could ask a question of Jeff. Alderman Riley. There are lots of areas in the code, Jeff, where we have a physical description of the boundaries as defined by streets.

And I guess why, I didn't prescribe that this apply to D districts. I think that happened in the lawyering, but would be perfectly happy to have this only apply to a very finite geographic boundary in the central business district, as we've done with other ordinances in the past. Again, my effort here is not to scoop up other wards into this policy.

And I'd be perfectly happy to serve as the city council's guinea pig on this effort and see how, give all my colleagues time to socialize it with their businesses to see if they would like this to apply to all D districts. My point is that we've got folks installing these storefronts in the next month, not three months from now. And so for me, at least in my ward, it's urgent.

It may not be in some of my colleagues' wards.

[Speaker 46] (2:21:51 - 2:22:28)
Can I ask, it sounds like what you are suggesting is defining a bounded area that is based in logic and is not simply the ward boundaries. Correct. Okay.

That strikes me as perfectly fine to do. I think if you want to task the LRB with preparing an amended version that could be circulated later in the meeting. Let me do that then.

Then the committee could certainly swap that out and pass it as amended.

[Speaker 11] (2:22:29 - 2:22:44)
And then later on, Mr. Chairman, if I may speak. Then later on, Jeff, if the rest of us wanted to be added to it, we always can amend it, right?

[Speaker 17] (2:22:45 - 2:22:45)
You bet.

[Speaker 11] (2:22:46 - 2:22:46)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:22:47 - 2:22:54)
All right. So we're going to hold. Sounds like we're going to hold on this item.

Chairman. Revisit it today. Yes, Brendan.

[Speaker 5] (2:22:55 - 2:23:01)
So yeah, I'll pop off and ask LRB to whip up a substitute that reflects what we just discussed.

[Speaker 1] (2:23:02 - 2:25:08)
Thank you, Alderman. All right. So now we're going to move on to large signs over 100 square feet in area, 24 feet above grade.

We'll hear them all together. I will read the ward followed by the address and take a motion at the end. In the first ward, two signs at 1425 North Milwaukee, in the third ward, 329 East Garfield Boulevard, in the third ward also at 209 East Cullerton, in the 11th ward, 639 West Roosevelt Road, in the 25th ward, three signs at 560 West Renshaw.

Lastly, in the 28th ward, 1401 West 15th Street. Can I get a motion? I'll move to pass by Alderman Waguespack.

Hold on a second. I got to read it correctly. All right.

So motion by the same roll call vote that was used to determine quorum. Alderman Waguespack moves on that motion. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? These items are passed.

All right. Now we have one item. It's a landmark item.

It's not in Pilsen. Don't get too excited yet. We have item number OR2020-156.

The order is referred to on June 17th of 20, historical landmark fee waiver, located at 5023-5029 and 5035 South Greenwood Avenue. It is my understanding we have a substitute on this matter. Do I hear a motion to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

Alderman Cardona moves to accept the substitute. All those in favor?

[Speaker 27] (2:25:09 - 2:25:09)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (2:25:10 - 2:25:25)
Any opposed? And the opinion chair of the ayes have. A substitute is before us.

We have Diana Cavallo from the Department of Planning and Development to answer any questions on the matter. Diana, first talk about the substitute, please.

[Speaker 31] (2:25:28 - 2:26:18)
Hello, Chairman Taney and members of the committee. So this is a permit fee waiver in the amount of $1,500 for a project of masonry exterior work at KAM Uzziah Israel Congregation Church. The property is a landmark.

It was designated in 1977 and it is a home to the two oldest Jewish congregations in Chicago. It was founded in 1847 and 1852. The temple was designed and constructed by architect Alfred Altschuler in 1924.

Excuse me. So we recommend approval of this permit fee waiver for the work that has been reviewed by the Landmarks Commission. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:26:20 - 2:26:27)
I believe this item is in the fourth ward. Alderman Taney, do you have any further comments on the request?

[Speaker 66] (2:26:32 - 2:26:34)
I'm sorry, Chairman. Did you just call me?

[Speaker 1] (2:26:34 - 2:26:45)
Yes, Alderman. We're talking about the permit application under landmark for the synagogues on Greenwood.

[Speaker 66] (2:26:46 - 2:26:52)
And yeah, no, I'm in favor of that waiver. All righty. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:26:53 - 2:27:07)
So if there are no further questions by committee members, do I hear a motion by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? So moved by Alderman Hatton. Alderman Hatton moves.

Do pass. All those in favor?

[Speaker 71] (2:27:08 - 2:27:08)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (2:27:09 - 2:28:50)
Any opposed? Opinion Chair, the ayes have it. The item is passed.

Now we're going to move on to the regular agenda. Let me just see. Again, we're going to go a little bit out of order for Chairman Mitz, who has a previous engagement that she's been very patient on.

But in an effort to minimize technical difficulties and to ensure the committee meeting runs as smoothly as possible, the typical order in which items will be heard has been updated. Throughout the duration of virtual committee on zoning meetings, items will be grouped together according to witness slash attorney and will be heard in that order rather than the ward order. All right.

So let's go to we're in page 11, the top of page 11. The document numbers 20258, 37th Ward Ordinance was referred on November 13 of 19. The common address is 1830 through 64 North LeClaire Avenue, 1815 through 1915 North Laramie Avenue.

The change request is a residential plan development number 1149 and institutional plan development 1150 to be 3-2 Community Shopping District, then to institutional plan development 1150 as amended. And we have the attorney is Graham Brady.

[Speaker 71] (2:29:02 - 2:29:02)
Graham Brady.

[Speaker 10] (2:29:11 - 2:29:13)
Good morning, Chairman Toney. Are you able to hear me now?

[Speaker 22] (2:29:14 - 2:29:14)
We are.

[Speaker 10] (2:29:14 - 2:29:32)
Thank you. Thank you, Chairman Toney and members of the committee. And thank you for your service to the city of Chicago in these trying times.

My name is Graham Brady. I'm a partner at the Taft, Stettinius and Hollister law firm. First, I request that the proceedings of the Chicago Plan Commission for this application be entered into and made a part of the record of this meeting.

[Speaker 1] (2:29:32 - 2:29:56)
Uh, Revoyas moves to incorporate the records from the Plan Commission by the same roll call vote that was issued to determine quorum. All those in favor? Aye.

Aye. And those opposed? The ayes have it and the records are incorporated.

And continue, Graham.

[Speaker 10] (2:29:57 - 2:35:19)
Thank you, Chairman. I have with me today Danita Travis, the executive director of the By the Hand Club for Kids, along with Pastor John Zayas, who's the pastor of Grace and Peace Fellowship. Also Olim and Emma Mitz is a part of our presentation as well.

Could we have the PowerPoint, please? And Chairman, I am respectful of your time. I'm going to move exceedingly quickly.

I mean, no offense to the committee, but as this matter has been reviewed by the Plan Commission and I'm aware of your large agenda, I'd like to go quickly if possible. This is for the North Austin Community Center at this address identified. Next slide, please.

The property is indicated in the red. The portion on the left, existing PD 1149, is property owned by the city of Chicago, which will be acquired by the applicant. Plan Development 1150 is owned jointly by By the Hand Club for Kids and the Grace and Peace Fellowship.

Next slide, please. This slide shows the surrounding uses in the area. Next slide, please.

In the upper right, you can see this black and white photo shows that the site is largely vacant. One building you see in the upper right-hand corner is the existing Grace and Peace Fellowship. These other photos show the context of the streets in the vicinity.

Next slide. This is a rendering as viewed from Laramie of the new facility. You can see the name there, the North Austin Community Center, as well as the logo of the By the Hand Club for Kids.

Next slide. This is a site plan. Starting in the upper right-hand corner, the gray building that you see there is the existing Grace and Peace Fellowship Church and Social Service Center, about which you will hear more shortly.

To the left, the large gray building, that's the site plan for the new North Austin Community Center, which will provide significant community activities and after-school programming. You will hear more about that later. In the lower left is the outdoor recreation area in blue, which will provide recreational space in the community.

To the right of that in the lower right-hand corner in the green shaded area is a large outdoor play field to be developed subsequently for all types of sports, rugby, soccer, and others. Then in the center right, you see the large parking lot, which is very well landscaped. Next slide.

This is a floor plan of the North Austin Community Center, recreation space, as well as a meeting space and multipurpose space, and it also contains a kitchen. Next slide. This is the roof plan in the second floor shown at the lower end.

Next slide. This shows the different sub areas to be very abbreviated about it. The blue area is the Grace and Peace Fellowship.

The uses will include religious assembly, auditorium, school, community center, daycare, banquet facilities, food pantry, counseling services, and social service programs. The green area permitted uses for by the hand club for kid in the 140,000 square foot North Austin Community Center include afterschool related programs, community center, recreation buildings, indoor sports and recreation, and banquet and meeting halls. The purple section at the bottom, again, this is our outdoor athletic facilities where outdoor athletic facilities will be permitted uses.

And the yellow area is our accessory parking. Next slide. The red line shows our vehicular transportation.

This is intentionally jogged so that it does not become a cut through street in the neighborhood. The blue line shows the pedestrian access. Next slide.

The project will be totally compliant with the city's sustainability matrix. Next slide. This is just an example of construction by the hand club for kids elsewhere in the Austin community.

What you see at the top is a former buildings located at 415 North Laramie. And the slide at the bottom is the existing replacement facility, which is a huge community benefit. Again, at 415 North Laramie, where by the hand club for kids operates afterschool and enrichment programs.

Next slide. The photo at the top is at 416 North Laramie in central Austin. These buildings have all been demolished and replaced by the building shown at the bottom, which is owned by by the hand club for kids, which is a landlord for the by or the mounting Everest charter school.

Next slide. The project timeline is shown here. It's going to move along expeditiously.

Next slide. The project benefits are many. 100 construction jobs, 50 permanent jobs, acquisition of long vacant city owned property, which is in need of environmental remediation.

The project budget is in excess of 25 million. There will be full participation here in terms of minority and women owned businesses, a city residency, as well as significant hiring from within the 37th ward. Next slide.

This is the evening rendering. I want to mention to the commission members, we have many more slides on this in this deck, but I'd like to pause here and turn the microphone to Danita Travis, the executive director of by the hand club for kids. Danita.

[Speaker 32] (2:35:20 - 2:38:19)
Thank you, Graham. Can you hear me? Good.

So I'm founder and executive director of by the hand club for kids, where I have served as a full-time volunteer for 20 years. By the hand club is an out of school time program that takes kids by the hand in kindergarten and walks with them all the way through college, mind, body, and soul. And I could share many, many stats, but just know that we partner with 18 Chicago public schools today and our principals at our partner schools recommend children to us who are not meeting reading standards.

And today two thirds of our kids are on the honor roll. And we're so proud of them and so excited about that. Just a couple of other statistics.

Our annual operating budget is $10 million and only 6% of that comes from the government. Most of our money comes from private donations. We employ 139 full-time and part-time staff and 68% of our staff are African-Americans.

You saw the work that we're doing in central Austin. Just want to make a couple of comments about our work there. We're serving a thousand kids on the corner of Kinsey and Laramie.

We've created more than 60 permanent jobs in central Austin. We've brought in more than $60 million for operating and capital to our neighborhood here. And I don't know if you saw just in the news a couple of weeks ago, but we are so excited with the help of a lot of friends, we were able to purchase Belmonte liquor stores and we're tearing that down.

And our high school students are popping up a fresh food market to help address the food insecurities in our neighborhood. We're so excited about that. So bottom line is we want to bring a by the hand club to North Austin and are excited to be able to do this with a long time neighborhood partner, Grace and Peace Church.

We bought property there next to Grace and Peace in 2018. We bought an acre and a half property and we've been working diligently on this project. We've engaged schools, parents, children, and have strong support for our plans.

By the hand club will serve 400 new students in North Austin. And we're most excited about being able to do this in partnership with Grace and Peace Church in order to reach the whole family. So in closing, I'll just say that I think we all are more aware than ever of the importance of investing in our neighborhoods like Austin.

And by the hand club is so excited and eager to move forward on this project. Thank you.

[Speaker 10] (2:38:19 - 2:38:42)
Thank you, Danita. As you can see members of the committee, Danita Travis is a force of nature. If you could please harken back to the comments that were made at the beginning of the meeting during the public commentary period, there is huge support for by the hand club for kids and the enormous work that they do in raising up this community.

I'd next like to introduce Pastor John Zayas, pastor of Grace and Peace Fellowship. Pastor.

[Speaker 1] (2:38:43 - 2:38:48)
Graham, before you do that, Graham, I want you, you said you were going to be expeditious. Okay.

[Speaker 10] (2:38:49 - 2:38:49)
We're done.

[Speaker 1] (2:38:50 - 2:38:58)
We're done. You've got a lot of, we got a lot of people that want to talk on this. We heard the public comment period and I've never seen Alderman Mitz so beaming.

So.

[Speaker 10] (2:39:00 - 2:39:06)
Alderman Mitz is our last speaker and we want to thank Alderman Mitz for the community process she led. Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (2:39:07 - 2:39:09)
Well, wait, are we hearing from the pastor? Yes.

[Speaker 32] (2:39:10 - 2:39:13)
Yes, we'd like to hear just a minute from the pastor.

[Speaker 10] (2:39:13 - 2:39:39)
Okay. Pastor. I'm afraid that the pastor lost his technological connection.

The same thing happened at the committee on zoning. I would just say very briefly, in addition to a church, Grace and Peace Fellowship runs a daycare center, a food pantry and numerous other social services. And they've been in this location for many, many years and will continue to provide much needed services there.

[Speaker 1] (2:39:40 - 2:39:43)
And I'm sorry you can't hear from pastor directly. Thank you, Graham. Alderman Mitz.

[Speaker 67] (2:39:45 - 2:40:41)
Thank you very much, chairman and committee members. It's not a lot I can tell you because my community have already spoken on how important this is. And if you know me in the council, you've been hearing me talking about a youth center for 20 years.

And so just having something for young peoples is very important. And even now, more so than ever. So I'm just happy at this point that we are able to get here.

We've had a lot of community input and we had a great partnership with Pastor John and Denita and yes, the community as a whole. We're all excited and we're ready to take off running. As soon as you all say this project is approved, then we can move forward.

So I'm thankful for all of you and thank you for taking the time and listening to us today.

[Speaker 1] (2:40:42 - 2:40:49)
Thank you, Alderman. We have questions on the project or comments. I'll start with Alderman Beal.

[Speaker 21] (2:40:54 - 2:40:59)
Alderman Beal. Yes, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.

Can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (2:40:59 - 2:41:00)
Yeah, we can hear you.

[Speaker 21] (2:41:01 - 2:42:03)
Wonderful. Mr. Chairman, I just want to say how excited I am for Alderman Emma Mitts. This is a wonderful project and she has wonderful partners.

And by the hand and the community should be extremely excited about the possibility, well, not the possibility, the reality of this particular project coming to the west side. I can tell you firsthand, the community center that we built here in the Rosen-Pullman community with the jobs that we've been able to create has attributed to crime being down almost 40% in my ward. Let me just say, Emma, this is going to help drive crime down on your side of town and partnering with by the hands and the things that they're bringing to your community.

They've also been in my community in the Ogill Gardens area for a lot of years. And let me just tell you, you should be one excited alderman to have this project in your ward. So you have great partners.

Congratulations. And I am so excited for you and everybody that brought this project to reality. Thank you so much and God bless everybody.

[Speaker 1] (2:42:03 - 2:42:06)
All right. Thank you, Alderman. Alderman David Moore.

[Speaker 15] (2:42:07 - 2:42:43)
Yes, real quick. Congratulations, Alderman, but also Donita, I know if we've worked together, I support you all. So just know that I got next, okay?

That's number one. The question, chairman. Question, David.

I'm sorry, I was muted. The question is for Attorney Graham. He said about the City of Old Land that as they acquired that, there's some environmental issues.

Who's taking care of the environmental issues on that?

[Speaker 10] (2:42:43 - 2:42:49)
The applicant will be remediating the site pursuant to the state of Illinois program.

[Speaker 15] (2:42:51 - 2:42:53)
The applicant, who is that?

[Speaker 10] (2:42:54 - 2:43:12)
That's the By the Hand Club for Kids and Grace and Peace Fellowship. They formed an entity called the North Austin Community Center, LLC, and they will be responsible for the remediation, but under the guidance and in coordination with the City's Department of Environment and the state of Illinois.

[Speaker 15] (2:43:12 - 2:43:15)
All right. Thank you so much. Alderman Cardona.

[Speaker 44] (2:43:18 - 2:44:15)
Thank you, chairman. I just wanna just, I'm excited for Alderman Emma Mitts because where the construction is gonna be held is not too far from my ward. And I am so happy for North Austin to have leaders like Hand Club for Kids and Grace and Peace Church with Pastor Zayas.

I know Pastor Zayas, I know he's been doing a lot of great stuff in North Lawndale and also with Alderman Emma Mitts, but you know what? It's such a blessing and it's such a breath of fresh air that's gonna be happening right there North Austin area. And once again, congratulations, Alderman Mitts.

I'm excited for you. I'm excited for this project that's gonna be and I support you 120%. Thank you, Alderman.

Alderman Walter Burnett.

[Speaker 1] (2:44:19 - 2:44:25)
Walter. Yes. Can you hear me?

We can hear you, Walter.

[Speaker 11] (2:44:25 - 2:45:27)
Okay. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. I swear by this organization, they started out in Cabrini-Green almost 25 or 26 years ago when I started as Alderman.

They have helped so many people, lives to be saved in the Cabrini-Green area and to advance their lives. And we have a lot of college graduates because of By the Hand Club. They've taken young people who were labeled as kids who couldn't learn and had them to go to college.

This is a great organization. I'm happy for Emma. I will hope that there was some tip money to help with the remediation of the environmental things over there.

But this organization is great. I'd like to thank Donita Travis for all she do. God bless her and God bless all of the Christian volunteers that help out with our kids on the West side.

This is great for the West side and it's great for the city of Chicago. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:45:28 - 2:45:44)
All right. I'm gonna call on Vice Chair Roboius, but we have a number of people that wanna testify, but I also I'm getting numerous texts about other applications and other Aldermen's anxiety about hearing their stuff. So let's try to be short and sweet.

Vice Chair Roboius.

[Speaker 56] (2:45:46 - 2:46:46)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to make a correction that this is the Northwest side. Northwest side.

But I am very happy for our colleague, Emma Mitts. Pastor John and I go back at least 25 years. We met while we were coaching football, but I've seen Pastor John in action in the community and he makes a lot of changes.

He makes a lot of difference in our community. I admire his fortitude, his attitude and his direction of community service for our kids. But I also am very grateful that by the hand and Alderman Mitts has gotten together in a beautiful project.

And it's gonna really bring a lot of resources and the communities in need why we need to do this. So thank you to by the hand. Thank you to Pastor John and congratulations to Alderman Mitts.

[Speaker 1] (2:46:47 - 2:46:51)
Thank you, Vice Chair. Alderman Jason Irvin.

[Speaker 62] (2:46:55 - 2:47:24)
Thank you, Chairman. And again, also Alderman Mitts, congratulations on this. Again, always good to see a Christian organization helping young kids on the West side of Chicago.

When we have so many people going wayward, they're providing a foundation for our young people that is so sorely needed in our community. So congratulations to by the hand club, Pastor John and Alderman Mitts. And now you don't have to remap mine into your ward.

Thank you and God bless you.

[Speaker 1] (2:47:24 - 2:47:32)
Thank you, Alderman. Alderman Pat Dowell. Alderman Dowell.

[Speaker 16] (2:47:33 - 2:47:59)
Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just wanted to congratulate Emma on this accomplishment. Emma, you are always talking at city council.

You're very consistent all the time about the importance of supporting our young people and about the need to provide resources for them. And I just wanna congratulate you on bringing this forward and your perseverance in getting this work done. Congratulations.

[Speaker 1] (2:48:00 - 2:48:03)
Thank you, Alderman. And finally, Alderman Osterman.

[Speaker 20] (2:48:04 - 2:48:25)
I too wanna congratulate Emma for our colleagues. We know how difficult some of these projects are to see come from a plan to fruition and to be able to help young people on the West side. It's a lasting legacy.

And Emma, I know how much it means to you and glad to be able to support it today. And congratulations.

[Speaker 67] (2:48:26 - 2:48:26)
Thank you.

[Speaker 20] (2:48:28 - 2:48:29)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (2:48:30 - 2:48:53)
Seeing no more questions by committee members, do I hear a motion to pass by the same roll call vote that was used for tomorrow? Alderman Cardona. Alderman Dowell moves to pass as amended.

All those in favor? Aye. Aye twice for Emma.

All right. In opinion of the Chair of the Ayes, dramatically have it. The item is passed as revised.

[Speaker 10] (2:48:53 - 2:48:54)
Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:48:54 - 2:48:56)
Thank you, Chairman and committee.

[Speaker 10] (2:48:56 - 2:48:57)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:48:57 - 2:49:35)
All right. Now we're going to be on the top of page three. And this item is document number 8468, 28th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on 12-12-18. The document number is 02018-9317. Common address 4500-4518 West Harrison.

Change request. M12 Limited Manufacturing District to an RT4 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district. Alderman Jason Irvin.

[Speaker 62] (2:49:37 - 2:50:22)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Again, this is a very small change on a block that's manufacturing and also residential. The portion of the block that we're seeking to rezone is the portion that is residential.

Again, this is along Harrison and what was semi-industrial probably 40 years ago. But now there are some houses in there that were caught up in the changes of the zoning map probably some 10-12 years ago. So we're just trying to make these small adjustments.

I have a series of these coming to committee to these little small adjustments that you'll continue to see from us as we make some corrections to the zoning map in the ward. So I would ask for a favorable consideration of this ordinance.

[Speaker 1] (2:50:23 - 2:50:44)
Thank you. And before I ask for questions from the committee members, I want to apologize. I know Jason, there was some mix up with the mail and the title searches and such.

So I really thank you for the patience, not by our committee. Trust me, it was by third parties. So with that, we have questions for the Alderman.

[Speaker 4] (2:50:46 - 2:50:49)
Hearing no questions moved up, do pass by Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 1] (2:50:49 - 2:51:06)
Okay. There was a motion by Alderman Lopez to move to pass by the same roll call that was issued to determine quorum. All those in favor.

Aye. Any opposed? In the chair of the ayes have it, the item is passed.

[Speaker 62] (2:51:06 - 2:51:07)
Now, thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:51:09 - 2:52:03)
All right. Next, we're going to go to the bottom of middle. I'm sorry, the middle of page 11, a little bit out of order.

I just wanted to reiterate to our colleagues, we've got a long agenda and we're going to try to go through as expeditiously as Chairman Ed Smith used to say over the years. So I'm going to read the document number 20256, 43rd Ward. Ordinance was referred on November 13th of 19.

The common address 2653 North Clark Street. The change request B12 Neighborhood Shopping District to B13 Neighborhood Shopping District, then to Residential Business Plan Development. Okay, so Alderman Michelle Smith, whose ward this project encompasses, wants to just say a few words before we hear from the attorney, Paul Shadle.

[Speaker 23] (2:52:04 - 2:55:03)
Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I'll be brief.

And thank you to my colleagues for letting me to speak first. I have to leave. But I also want to congratulate Alderman Mitts on her terrific achievement.

This project that will be coming to you is a project that we've been working on for many years in order to preserve a single room occupancy hotel in Lincoln Park, obviously one of the most expensive areas in our city. And we put together a plan, which you will hear about, where we were able to preserve the SRO and have a mid-rise building that fit in very well with the adjoining residential neighborhood. For my colleagues who are involved in these kind of things, when this property was available for purchase, it had been neglected for some time.

The owner died. And we were approached by many, many developers wanting to put up a big high-rise. And that would not have allowed us to either satisfy the community nor meet the affordable housing numbers that we are getting out of this development.

So I held out, wouldn't let a developer come on the property until we found someone who would preserve the SRO, which is the company NHP. And they created a project, I think you can see it, the yellow space, that's the covent. And the yellow space is the covent.

And behind it was a parking lot. And now there will be an apartment building on that backside. And that apartment building is helping to fund the preservation of 31 SRO units who now will be turned into little tiny units with kitchens and bathrooms before there was no baths and no kitchens in those units.

It will also be transformed into supportive housing, which is really important. And I am very grateful to have this development because the people who live in the covent are part of our communities. They've been there a long time.

They will not be displaced. They will be temporarily housed and allowed to come back. Those who of course want to, which I think is most of them, who are there now.

And we believe that this is a very creative solution to dealing with the problem of affordable housing in a very expensive neighborhood. The building will be put, the new building behind it will be oriented to the neighborhood. And you can see the buildings that it's next to.

They're just a story or two shorter. And it will be rentals, which is our community needs. So I do have to leave.

So I hope that you will support this project. Joanna Zane, my head of zoning is here in case anyone has any other questions, but I wanted to ask for your support. Thank you very, very much.

[Speaker 1] (2:55:06 - 2:55:40)
Before you go, the screen is right here. I, as you know, I'm very familiar with this project as part of the plan commission. Some questions, but what wasn't asked there is I think it's important when you see this aerial photo, the structure, the new structure, as you said, housed a parking facility that serviced the post office, which is directly south of the project.

And without that postal parking, have they found alternatives for the post office there?

[Speaker 23] (2:55:40 - 2:56:13)
We are working with Congressman Quigley on that project. This is going to be another year before they dig ground. They have arranged as a backup, backup, I guess I called it, for additional parking for the vehicles that would only park there at the century time.

Chairman, at the century. So there will always be, there's backup and backups, but Congressman Quigley has been really helping us to try to potentially change that location. So thanks for asking.

[Speaker 1] (2:56:13 - 2:56:18)
Thank you, Alderman. Now we'll hear from Paul Shadle on the presentation.

[Speaker 49] (2:56:19 - 2:57:08)
Morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. I'm Paul Shadle with the law firm of DLA Piper and along with my colleague, Katie Janke Dale and representing the applicant in this matter, the not-for-profit NHP Foundation. The request before the committee is to zone the property as a residential business plan development to accommodate two structures within the PD containing a total of 114 dwelling units with 30 units in the renovated Covent Hotel and 84 units in a new structure to be built on the existing surface parking lot.

With me this morning are Meki Adnani, who's a senior vice president with the applicant, the NHP Foundation and Dennis Langley, a principal with Weiss Langley, Weiss Architects. Our team will of course be available for questions. This application was considered and recommended for approval during the July 16th, 2020 plan commission meeting.

And I'd request that the transcript from that hearing be incorporated into the record of this proceeding.

[Speaker 1] (2:57:09 - 2:57:24)
So Alderman Rovoyos moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call vote that was used to determine quorum. All those in favor? Aye.

Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it.

The records are incorporated.

[Speaker 49] (2:57:24 - 2:58:36)
Will you continue, Paul? Sure. Alderman Smith has actually described the site in some detail for you.

So I'm going to skip over that quickly, leaving the exhibits up. As she noted, the project is the result of an extensive design and community review process led by her. And I also want to thank the city's departments of planning and development, housing, and transportation for their engagement with the review process.

The Coburn Hotel is a historic structure, so it will be rehabilitated to historic standards. As noted, the eastern portion will have this new structure containing 84 apartments. And it's notable that two of those will be affordable.

The developer of that, or the contract purchaser of that portion will also pay $794,000 into the city's affordable housing opportunity fund. If you could go to the next slide, this just shows the project from the northeast. And the last slide shows the project from the northwest.

CDOT reviewed the plans for this project and issued their approval. As you just heard, Alderman Smith also supports the project. We have our team here to answer any questions that you, Mr. Chairman, or the committee members may have.

[Speaker 1] (2:58:37 - 2:59:04)
All right, Paul, I'm glad you have that slide here because that corner of the Coburn Hotel, for full disclosure, I was the tenant in that corner for about 15 years. So it's not like I'm not familiar with the Coburn Hotel, and I probably also live about three blocks from that. So it's a handsome renovation and the SRO.

With that being said, I think Alderman Burnett has a question or two.

[Speaker 11] (2:59:06 - 2:59:52)
No, I just want to commend the developer, commend the Alderman, and also commend the residents of Lincoln Park for staying inclusive and being creative on financing a SRO building that needed some help. So, and one of the things that wasn't mentioned, in lieu of fees that goes from the larger building, the affordable housing component is going right into the hotel. So it's not going into the broader ARO funds.

It's going right into the hotel to help to keep that building affordable. So I commend the creative financing. I commend the Alderman and everyone that's involved.

Congratulations.

[Speaker 1] (2:59:54 - 3:00:03)
Any more questions from committee members? Hearing none, can I get a motion to pass by the same roll call vote that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 44] (3:00:04 - 3:00:05)
Alderman Cardona motion.

[Speaker 1] (3:00:06 - 3:00:10)
Our Alderman Cardona moves to pass as revised. All those in favor?

[Speaker 44] (3:00:11 - 3:00:11)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (3:00:12 - 3:00:17)
Aye. Opposed? Opinion chair, the ayes have it.

The item is passed as revised.

[Speaker 49] (3:00:17 - 3:00:18)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (3:00:19 - 3:01:17)
Staying on page... Let me just double check. 11.

Staying on page 11. We are going to be in the 47th ward, document number 20383. Ordinance was referred on April 22nd of 2020.

Common address is 5001 through 5009 North Clark Street. Change request, C12 neighborhood commercial district to a C22 motor vehicle related commercial district. We have John Escobar to make the presentation.

How about... Chairman, can you hear me? Yes, we can.

John, will you identify yourself if you are who you are?

[Speaker 17] (3:01:17 - 3:05:45)
Yes, of course. Thank you, Chairman, members of the committee, attorney John Escobar from the law office of Tristan Cervantes. On behalf of the applicant, Quaz LLC, the application number is 20383 and the subject property 5001-5009 North Clark Street.

This applicant is proposing to establish a C2 zoning change. The proposed amendment is a change from the current C12 neighborhood commercial zoning district to a C22 motor vehicle related zoning district. Again, the property is at 5001 North Clark.

The proposed... The applicant intends to expand the current medical and adult use dispensary use into the adjacent storefront and also add an office space, which would ultimately have the operation encompass the entire 5001-5009 North Clark building. So the same entity that currently operates at 5001 North Clark would remain the sole operator of the entire premise.

The applicant, of course, will be seeking special use as per Chicago zoning ordinance requirements under section 17-3-0200. The proposed dispensary will be managed and operated by the applicant QAS LLC, which has a principal place of business in Illinois and was established in 2008. The applicant, as I mentioned, currently operates dispensary 33, which is a medical cannabis and recreational adult use dispensary at the location of 5001 North Clark, which was the first medical cannabis dispensary to open in Chicago in 2015 and remains one of the few local Chicago-owned and operated shops in the city and also one of the only minority and women-owned cannabis dispensaries in the state. On or about January 1st of this year, the applicant expanded its dispensary operation at this location to include the sale of dispensing recreational adult use cannabis pursuant to all proper required licenses, permits, and certification from the city of Chicago and state of Illinois.

The applicant will dispense and offer for sale variety of cannabis and other related products, including without limitation, dried cannabis, concentrates, edibles, and topicals. Their proposed dispensary will of course operate in a manner consistent with all applicable city of Chicago and state of Illinois regulatory rules and guidelines for storage, dispensing, and destruction of cannabis and other related activities. All staff members must be registered and certified and pass background checks with the state of Illinois, the IADFPR, as well as conduct and meet the minimum amount of training and education each year.

Pursuant to the Medical Cannabis Act, all employees will be properly trained and educated in their respective areas of operation, including with regard to all applicable HIPAA and FDA guidelines. The applicant attends and is committed to meet the goals of the city's Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection, the BACP, by employing a workforce representative of the city in which it's located and operating, which shall have staff and members from a wide array of minority groups with local roots in Chicago. The proposed dispensary will operate pursuant to the state ordinance for dispensaries, which does allow operation for up to seven days a week from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., and will accommodate regulators and other authorities for inspections, as well as information on shipment delivery schedules. The applicant met with and has garnered support of multiple local community groups and has held community meetings regarding the project. The applicant has also met and conferred with the aldermen on multiple occasions regarding this project and has obtained the letter of support, which was previously provided to the committee. That said, I'd like to thank the committee for their time, and we respectfully request that the committee give a favorable consideration in approval of this application.

[Speaker 1] (3:05:45 - 3:05:56)
Thank you, John. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Martin. I don't know if Alderman Martin wants to say anything in regards to this application.

Alderman Martin.

[Speaker 69] (3:05:57 - 3:06:54)
Thank you, Chair, and I'll be brief. As John had mentioned, we've had at least three community meetings around this, two for neighbors, actually four, two for neighbors associations, one for a chamber of commerce, and a separate one that my office put together. The feedback was overwhelmingly positive.

When the transition happened, allowing for commercial sales earlier this year, the dispensary partnered with neighboring businesses. So this was pre-COVID to ensure that when waiting occurred, that patrons were encouraged to patron neighboring businesses specifically bars and restaurants. So they have very strong relationships with the community.

It's also the same ownership group that recently received this committee's approval to open a dispensary in the West Loop having received Alderman Burnett's support. So thank you all for your time, and I would appreciate this committee's favorable consideration.

[Speaker 1] (3:06:55 - 3:07:22)
Questions for the Alderman or the applicant? No hands up. Can I get a motion to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

Motion do pass. Cardona? Alderman Cardona moves to pass on the item.

All those in favor? Aye. Aye.

Aye. Any opposed? Opinion chair, the ayes have it.

The item is passed. Thank you.

[Speaker 17] (3:07:23 - 3:07:25)
Thank you, committee. Thank you, Alderman. Thank you, chair.

[Speaker 1] (3:07:25 - 3:07:49)
All right. Now we are... I'm just trying to figure out if I'm next.

I've got like four things on the agenda. We were going to return to the regular order business, but we can't. Yeah.

Alderman Wagespack, I am on page three. You are on the bottom of page four and five. Do you have a few minutes or do you want me to go out of order?

[Speaker 39] (3:07:52 - 3:07:54)
I'm ready. I'm ready.

[Speaker 1] (3:07:54 - 3:08:47)
All right. So long as you're brief, right? Okay.

So I'm going to have about the other 30 of me. I'm going to hop on my zoning real quick. Pestering me.

So let's go bottom of page four. Document number 20432 T1 32nd Ward. Ordinance was referred on June 17th of 2020.

Common address is 2658 North Greenview Avenue. And the change request, M12 limited manufacturing business park district to an RT4 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district. We have attorney Tom Moore.

Mr. Moore. Unmute. Mr. Moore, you need to unmute yourself, I think.

[Speaker 27] (3:08:49 - 3:09:42)
Can you hear me now? Yes, sir. Could you proceed?

And this is the single family home? This is Greenview. Yes, sir.

So this is a single lot that was left in what used to be a manufacturing zone. And it's all now residential. This was the loan manufacturing lot left.

We went through a process of the 32nd Ward. We presented a single family plan to them. It is the Alderman does want us to make it a type one so that the plan that we showed the community is the plan that will be built.

And we presented the plan to the local community group. And we have a letter of support from the Alderman and we request your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (3:09:45 - 3:09:48)
Thank you, Mr. Moore. Alderman Scott, walk us back.

[Speaker 39] (3:09:49 - 3:10:05)
Thank you, chairman. Mr. Moore is correct. And we did have a group meeting with the community.

This is for purposes of planning within that community area. And I ask for the favorable consideration of and vote for this agenda item from the committee.

[Speaker 1] (3:10:06 - 3:10:59)
Questions for the Alderman or the applicant? Hearing no questions, I get a motion to do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Alderman Ravoyos moves to pass.

All those in favor? Aye. Aye.

Opposed? Aye. Chair, the ayes have it.

The item is passed. Now we will stick with attorney Tom Moore. We're going to the top of page five.

The item number is 20053-T1 32nd Ward. Ordinance was referred on June 12th of 19. Common address 645 through 55 West Fullerton Avenue.

The change request M33 Heavy Industry District to its C32 Commercial Manufacturing and Employment District. Let's see.

[Speaker 27] (3:11:00 - 3:12:22)
Attorney Tom Moore. Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is an old industrial building in an industrial corridor. And therefore, we had to go through, in addition to the zoning change, or in order to zoning change, we had to go through the Planning Commission. And in the Planning Commission, there were many changes, really the whole building change, the whole concept, because the suggestion was made this should be a much greener, much friendlier, people friendly, changing it from industrial building to a people friendly building, where now there's going to be a daycare and a health club and a young person swim training center.

So the first thing is the description in your agenda has really evolved. And we submitted to the zoning department a amended narrative and plans. And I asked first that the plans presented to the Planning Commission, the amended narrative and substitute narrative and ordinance and plans be adopted to go forward in this committee.

All right.

[Speaker 1] (3:12:22 - 3:12:32)
So I'm going to ask that Alderman, I need a motion to incorporate the records from the Planning Commission by the same roll call vote that was used to determine quorum.

[Speaker 4] (3:12:33 - 3:12:34)
I move Chairman, Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 1] (3:12:35 - 3:13:02)
Alderman Lopez moves in favor. All those in favor? Aye.

Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it.

The records are incorporated. Do I need to do this one? All right.

So we're also informed that there's a substantive narrative and plans for the type one application. Is that correct?

[Speaker 27] (3:13:03 - 3:13:04)
That is correct.

[Speaker 1] (3:13:04 - 3:13:18)
Okay. So Alderman Rapoios moves to accept the substantive narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. All those in favor?

Aye. Aye. Any opposed?

So the ayes have it.

[Speaker 27] (3:13:18 - 3:14:25)
Substantive narrative and plans are accepted. All right. Continue Mr. Porter. So with the help of the Planning Commission, this project evolved. And so for instance, the daycare center can't have an outdoor playground because of its proximity to the transfer center on Medill. And so there's an atrium that will feel like an outdoor center and many other improvements.

And a lot of trees and greening up and making the whole feel of the building much more conducive to people use instead of industrial use. And we have the support of both the North Branch Industrial Group and the local community group, the Sheffield Neighbors. And we also have a letter of support from Alderman Waggesback and we'd request your support on the substitute narrative and plans.

[Speaker 1] (3:14:28 - 3:14:32)
Okay. Thank you. Alderman Waggesback.

[Speaker 17] (3:14:33 - 3:14:33)
Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 39] (3:14:34 - 3:15:10)
Mr. Moore is correct. We work very closely with the community group there, North Branch Works and Sheffield. The Plan Commission, as you know, you were there, passed through there with significant changes to the landscaping to really improve that manufacturing area for future development on adjacent properties.

And for the repurposing of the building, I'm very happy that they were able to do that for this particular project. So this zoning is for purposes of planning within this community area. And I ask for the favorable consideration and vote of the committee members on this agenda item.

[Speaker 1] (3:15:10 - 3:15:30)
Thank you. Thank you, Alderman. Questions by committee members?

Hearing no questions, can I get a motion to pass the same roll call vote that was used to determine quorum? That's with the revised plans and the substantive narrative. So we got to ask.

[Speaker 17] (3:15:31 - 3:15:33)
Is that Alderman Lopez on that one?

[Speaker 1] (3:15:34 - 3:15:39)
Okay. So Alderman Lopez moves to pass. All those in favor?

[Speaker 44] (3:15:39 - 3:15:40)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (3:15:40 - 3:15:48)
Aye. Any opposed? Chair, the ayes have it.

The item is passed as revised with the substantive narrative and plans.

[Speaker 27] (3:15:49 - 3:15:50)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (3:15:50 - 3:16:19)
All righty. Next, we're on the middle of page five. Document number 20386-T1, 32nd Ward.

Ordinance was referred on April 22nd of 2020. Common address is 1712 through 1720 North Damon Avenue. C12 neighborhood commercial district to a C22 motor vehicle related commercial district.

Is Andrew Scott is the attorney? Andrew?

[Speaker 54] (3:16:19 - 3:18:07)
I'm on. Can you hear me, Mr. Chairman? We can hear you.

Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you members of the committee. Is it okay to proceed, Mr. Chairman?

So the application before you, as you had mentioned, is an application to rezone the subject property from C12 neighborhood commercial district to C22 vehicle related commercial district. This is a type one, even though there are no proposed improvements associated with the exterior of the building in conjunction with discussions with the community groups. It was agreed that we would do this as a type one nonetheless.

The purpose of the rezoning is to establish the appropriate zoning classification to allow the Zenleaf Bucktown to apply for a special use permit for a dispensary. I should also mention that Sammy Dorf, the operator with Zenleaf is also on with me and is going to be available to answer any questions. But basically the proposed project is to lease approximately 4,700, I'm sorry, 4,600 square feet of ground floor space.

It's actually been vacant for more than five years. And they're assuming approval here and also approval before the zoning board of appeals. It would really be Zenleaf's flagship dispensary in the city.

So it's really a wonderful opportunity, not only for the community. We have met with the community groups. We went with the condo association immediately to the north of us to get their input.

We've also met with the local chamber of commerce. As I mentioned, we think this is a great opportunity to reactivate this part of North Damon Avenue. And we would really appreciate your favorable consideration.

Sammy and I are both available to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (3:18:10 - 3:18:11)
Alderman Wagesbeck.

[Speaker 39] (3:18:12 - 3:19:44)
Thank you, chairman. The group has been undergoing several different community meetings with the local organizations. This is an issue I think that everybody is concerned about as we move forward on cannabis operations and making sure that social equity issues are addressed.

We did have the wicker park committee that was not, they did vote against moving spot or moving for spot zoning requests in this area. But we also had Bucktown chamber, Bucktown community organization, and several individuals nearby who they met with and will continue to meet with should they move forward on special use. We were in here last year for similar issues with this property.

We've been trying to get it activated with different types of uses. And I feel strongly about the social equity applicants being able to come into this area again. And I know that Mr. Scott or Mr. Dwork would speak to what theirs are. But in terms of just the purposes for planning here, this is repurposing a building, making sure that we can move forward with utilizing the building that's been empty for I think almost two years now. And I would just ask for the favorable consideration of the committee members on this agenda item.

[Speaker 1] (3:19:46 - 3:20:15)
Questions for the, is that a question? I don't see any raised hand. All right.

Hearing no questions by committee members. Do I hear a motion to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? So moved Alderman Villegas.

Alderman Villegas moves to pass on the item. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Chair the ayes have it. Item is passed.

[Speaker 54] (3:20:16 - 3:20:17)
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (3:20:17 - 3:20:55)
Thank you. And finally with Alderman Wagenstaff moving to page nine, the top of page nine, document number 20389T1, 32nd Ward. Ordinance was referred on April 22nd of 2020.

Common addresses 1842 through 1858 West Webster Avenue, 2200 through 2242 North Lister. Change request M33 Heavy Industry District to a C23 Motor Vehicle Commercial District. We have Rolando Acosta to make the presentation in the 32nd Ward.

[Speaker 52] (3:20:55 - 3:22:11)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant. The site before you, some of you may remember was the former emissions testing facility operated by the state of Illinois.

It has been vacant for quite a number of years. It sits on a 51,000 square foot piece of property and has a building of about 9,000 square feet and was currently a sea of asphalt around the building. The proposal before you is to rezone the property to a C22 or C23 to allow the rehabilitation of the existing building by recladding it and the improvement, quite frankly, of the parking lot and expand the uses on the property.

The matter does have a substitute narrative and plans. Also was before the plan commission because this is a rezoning within an industrial corridor. So it was heard by the plan commission on July 16th and was recommended favorably for approval.

I would ask that the committee move to accept the substitute narrative and plans as well as the report and record of the hearing before the plan commission.

[Speaker 1] (3:22:12 - 3:22:50)
Okay, so let me do it in two motions. Alderman Roboius moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. All in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? Okay, the ayes have it.

Records are incorporated and then Alderman Cardona moves to accept the substantive narrative plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. All in favor? Say aye.

Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it.

The substantive narrative plans are accepted. Continue, Rolando.

[Speaker 52] (3:22:51 - 3:23:25)
We have been working. We have worked with Alderman Wagesback to ensure that we get responses and input from the community. As of today's date, we have heard no complaints about the proposed rezoning of this property.

And the modifications that were made during the plan commission process has provided for an extensive re-greening of the parking lot, removing a lot of the asphalt and replacing it by green space, including the addition of over 30 trees on the property. I'm happy to answer any questions that the committee may have about the proposed use.

[Speaker 1] (3:23:27 - 3:24:31)
Questions from committee members? Hearing none. Alderman Roboyes-Moose, do pass on the item by the same roll call vote that was used to determine quorum with the substantive narrative plans and the type one application.

All those in favor? Aye. Aye.

Any opposed? Opinion chair, the ayes have it. And this item is passed with the substantive narrative and plans.

Thank you. Thank you. Now we're going back to page three.

In the fifth ward, let's see. Document number 20431, fifth ward. Ordinance is referred on June 17th of 2020.

Common address is 5527 South Woodlawn Avenue. Change request. An RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RM4.5 residential multi-unit district. Nick Fotikas.

[Speaker 60] (3:24:33 - 3:25:54)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. I'm stepping in for Nick Fotikas today. For the record, my name is Daniel Box and I'm an attorney with the Law Offices of Samuel B.P. Banks located at 221 North LaSalle Street. I'm here on behalf of the applicant, the Robert J. Scheimer Trust, dated February 10th, 2016. The applicant owns the subject property located at 5527 South Woodlawn Avenue.

The applicant is seeking to save the existing secondary residential building or coach house at the subject site in its construction of a new single family residence at the property. In order to do so, it was determined during the permitting process that the subject lot had to be legally subdivided into two separate and independent zoning lots. Although not an orange-rated historic building, the coach house is being treated as such by the neighbors and Alderman Hairston, both of whom we understand desire its preservation given its location between two orange-rated homes within the Kenswood Historic District.

In order to permit the project, the applicant is seeking a zoning change from an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RM4.5 residential multi-unit district. We have already worked with Alderman Hairston on this project and I believe a letter of support was already provided to your office. With that, I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have.

[Speaker 1] (3:25:57 - 3:26:24)
All right. Thank you, Daniel. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Hairston on this project.

Alderman is not on the call, I think, at this point. No. Okay.

So any questions for the applicant? Hearing no questions, can I get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine and or establish quorum?

[Speaker 14] (3:26:25 - 3:26:26)
Sawyer moves do pass.

[Speaker 1] (3:26:26 - 3:26:29)
Alderman Sawyer moves do pass. All those in favor?

[Speaker 14] (3:26:30 - 3:26:31)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (3:26:31 - 3:26:37)
Any opposed? In the opinion, Chair, the ayes have it and the item is passed.

[Speaker 26] (3:26:37 - 3:26:40)
Thank you, Daniel.

[Speaker 1] (3:26:41 - 3:27:19)
Now we're middle of page 13. I'm sorry, page three. Document number 20418, 18th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on June 17th of 2020. The common address is 3216 West 87th Street. Change request.

Plan development number 1172 to C31, Commercial Manufacturing and Employment District. We have Pericles Abasi. Pericles, would you like to begin?

Yes, Mr. Chairman. I would.

[Speaker 41] (3:27:19 - 3:27:29)
And first, I had submitted a substitute ordinance to correct a couple of Scribner's errors. One was in the map number and the other was in the name of the previous zoning.

[Speaker 1] (3:27:31 - 3:27:49)
So Alderman Raboyas moves to accept the substitute by the same roll call vote that was used to determine quorum. So moved. All in favor?

Any opposed? Hearing none, the ayes have it. Substitute is in front of us.

Continue.

[Speaker 41] (3:27:54 - 3:29:03)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So this project is at the corner of 87th and Kedzie. I represent the applicant's Little Bear Holdings LLC who is under contract to purchase the lot with the zoning contingency.

We're seeking the zoning change to C31 so that the applicant can open a Buddy Bear car wash, which they have a number of others in the city. The C31 will allow a car wash and prevent residential from being at that property. The car wash will be approximately 4,800 square feet, have about 24 parking spaces slash vacuum spaces.

And we had a community meeting and I've submitted Alderman Curtis's letter of support. And he's been very enthusiastic about this project, especially considering that the site is directly across the street from Evergreen Park. And he's very enthusiastic about a business opening on the Chicago side rather than the suburban side.

So if you have any questions, I'll take them.

[Speaker 1] (3:29:05 - 3:29:22)
All right. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Curtis. Questions from committee members?

Hearing none, do I have a motion to pass by the same roll call vote that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 15] (3:29:23 - 3:29:24)
Alderman David Moore.

[Speaker 1] (3:29:24 - 3:30:12)
Alderman Lopez moves to pass. All those in favor? Aye.

Hearing any objection? Hearing no objections, so ordered. All right.

Thank you. Paraplegics, we're going to stay on with you. We have document number 20385, 27th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on April 22nd of 2020. The common address, 816 North May Street. And the change request, RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to an RM4.5 residential multi-unit district. Proceed, Eric, please. Unmute.

[Speaker 41] (3:30:14 - 3:31:13)
There we go. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yes, this project, it's the young couple that owns this building.

And they have a quite undersized lot. It's about 1,400 square feet. So in order to build a second story addition, to have the floor area ratio, they need to increase the zoning district from RT4 to RM4.5. Afterwards, the FAR will be 1.43. It'll be two-story, one dwelling unit. And there will continue to be no off-street parking spaces. And it'll be about 30 feet high. We had a community meeting with neighbors of River West a couple weeks ago, and they expressed their support.

And if Alderman Burnett is here, he had stated he'd like to give his opinion on it at the hearing, but I'm not sure if he's here right now.

[Speaker 1] (3:31:13 - 3:31:39)
I think he's still with us. Is that the end of your presentation? Yeah, yes.

Let's hear from Alderman Burnett. Walter, Alderman Burnett, please. Do we have a letter of support from Alderman Burnett?

[Speaker 52] (3:31:40 - 3:31:40)
No.

[Speaker 1] (3:31:43 - 3:31:47)
I think you have a letter of support from Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 41] (3:31:50 - 3:31:58)
No, Alderman Burnett had stated that he would be expressing his support at the hearing. And he was here earlier.

[Speaker 1] (3:31:59 - 3:32:30)
Yeah, he was on the call most of the morning. So maybe he stepped out. So I'm gonna have to hold this until we find him.

But we'll get back to you, okay? Okay, thank you, Chairman. All right, we have to go back to this.

All right. Take a motion to defer this item. All right.

So I'm gonna read this document number. It's a deferral for the attorney, which we just became aware of. Or was it in the beginning?

[Speaker 66] (3:32:31 - 3:32:33)
We got that one. Sorry about that. We're gonna move to the next item.

[Speaker 1] (3:32:34 - 3:33:02)
Okay, we're not gonna worry about that one. So now we're in the middle of page four. Document number 20430T1, 30th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on June 17th of 2020. The common address, 3704 through 3710 North Cicero. The change requests a B3-1 Community Shopping District to a B2-3 Neighborhood Mixed Use District.

Dan Lauer.

[Speaker 42] (3:33:03 - 3:33:20)
Hi. Hi, Mr. Chairman. I hope you can hear me.

We can, proceed. All right. This is application 20430T1.

And I have a substitute narrative plan. So if you could, Mr. Chairman, do that same roll call vote as to determine quorum for me, please.

[Speaker 1] (3:33:21 - 3:33:41)
Okay. Alderman Lopez moves to accept the substitute narrative plans. It's for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

All those in favor? All those in favor on that?

[Speaker 71] (3:33:42 - 3:33:42)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (3:33:43 - 3:33:49)
Any opposed? The ayes have it. Substantive narrative plans are accepted.

[Speaker 66] (3:33:49 - 3:33:50)
Continue, Dan.

[Speaker 42] (3:33:51 - 3:35:14)
Mr. Chairman, this is 3704-3710 North Cicero and Vice-Chairman Raboy versus Ward. I represent G7 Investments, LLC Series L. This is an abandoned janitorial supply.

A place called Corti. I did send in some slides, but just imagine just an abandoned three lot industrial building that's been vacant for many years, it appears. And at Alderman Ariel Raboy versus direction, we held a community meeting at St. Bartholomew Church on February 13th. Seems like a long time ago before COVID. There were no objectors at that meeting. Alderman Raboy has a standard procedure where he allows a comment period for at least two weeks from the date of the meeting.

I'm not aware of any objectors, even after that comment period. This is a proposal to change to B2-3 for 17 dwelling units with 21 parking spaces. There's commercial space at the southwest corner on 1800 square feet, four stories.

And we certainly wanna thank Alderman Raboy and his staff, and we do have a letter of support. All right, Alderman Raboy.

[Speaker 56] (3:35:15 - 3:35:55)
Thanks, Mr. Chairman. As Mr. Lowery indicated, we did have a community meeting on February 13th. Everyone was on board.

We later during the period of comment, we allow about two weeks. We did get a couple of calls. They wanted additional parking spaces, so we increased it to 21 parking spaces, 17 units, and one dwelling unit will be set as an affordable requirement.

So I'm asking for your support on this matter before you. Thank you. Questions for the applicant?

[Speaker 1] (3:35:57 - 3:36:02)
Hearing no questions, can I get a motion to adopt this item by the same roll call used to establish form?

[Speaker 15] (3:36:04 - 3:36:06)
So moved by Alderman David Moore.

[Speaker 1] (3:36:06 - 3:36:11)
Alderman David Moore, so moved. Hearing all those in favor?

[Speaker 15] (3:36:11 - 3:36:12)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (3:36:13 - 3:36:52)
Any objecting? Hearing no objections, item is ordered with the substantive narrative and plans. Thank you, Dan.

All right, now we're going to move to the bottom of page 5, 33rd Ward, document number 20434-T1. Again, 33rd Ward ordinance was referred on June 17th of 2020. Common address is 3334-3336 West Lawrence Avenue.

The change request of B12 Neighborhood Shopping District to a B23 Neighborhood Mixed Use District. Tyler Manick, would you like to?

[Speaker 37] (3:36:53 - 3:38:27)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Tyler Manick of the Shane Bakes Law Firm. I'm here on behalf of the African Bass Realty II LLC, which owns a property commonly known as 3334-3336 West Lawrence, which is a subject of this zoning map amendment application.

The applicant is requesting a zoning map amendment from a B12 zoning district to a B23 zoning district to renovate the existing mixed use building and add an additional dwelling unit on the garden level. The existing building currently contains 12 dwelling units, six office spaces and three commercial units. The total commercial space is 9,277 square feet.

After renovation, the building will contain 13 dwelling units, six and six commercial units. The applicant will not change the existing 12 dwelling units or the six office spaces and three commercial units. The building will remain as existing.

The building is also located on pedestrian street and within 1,200 feet from the CTA Brown Line Kedzie Station. So it's a transit serve location. The applicant has worked with Alderman Rodriguez about the zoning amendment application and has successfully engaged her award community process.

Based upon those meetings and discussions, the alderman has given us a letter of support, which I believe the committee has on file. As a result, I respectfully request this committee's favorable vote and recommending passage of the applicant's application to amend the zoning of 3334-3336 West Lawrence. And I'd be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (3:38:27 - 3:39:30)
All right. All right. Questions for the applicant?

We do have a letter from Rodriguez Sanchez in support of the project. Questions? Then hearing no hands up, can I get a motion to adopt this item by the same roll call vote used to establish quorum?

So moved. Alderman Burnett moves. So moves.

Hearing no objection, so ordered. Thank you. All right.

Now, Alderman Burnett, we're going to go back to you. We lost you there for a second. Bottom of page three, Pericles was making a presentation on 816 North May Street.

And that document number 20385, the ordinance was referred on April 22nd, 2020. You said that we didn't have a letter of support from you, but you were going to testify. So we missed you there while we were on there.

So do you want to talk about 816 North May?

[Speaker 11] (3:39:31 - 3:39:48)
Yeah. So they did meet with the local community organization, the neighbors of River West. I conferred with them.

They were all in support of it. So I support this project and I ask the committee to support it also. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:39:49 - 3:40:14)
For Alderman Burnett. Seeing no hands up, can I get a motion to adopt this item by the same roll call used to establish quorum? Alderman Dow moves do pass on the item.

Hearing no objection, objections? No. Hearing none, this item is passed as ordered.

Thank you.

[Speaker 11] (3:40:15 - 3:40:16)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:40:16 - 3:40:51)
Now, let me go back. Where are we at now? We're now in Tyler.

So now we're back to Tyler. Okay. All right.

[Speaker 37] (3:40:51 - 3:41:58)

LLC, which owns a property commonly known as 4202 to 4204 West Irving Park Avenue. And which is a subject of this zoning map amendment application. The applicant is requesting a zoning amendment from a B3-1 zoning district to a B3-2 zoning district to develop the parcel into a three-story restaurant. After construction, the building will be 5,480 square feet, entirely consisting of restaurant space.

The property is also a transit serve location in close proximity to the Irving Park metro station. The applicant has met with Alderman Gardner about the zoning map amendment application has met with the local community group to share the plans. Based on those meetings and discussions, the Alderman has given us and the committee his letter of support.

As a result, I respectfully request this committee's favorable vote in recommending passage of the applicant's application to amend the zoning of 4202 to 4204 West Irving Park Avenue. And I would be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (3:42:00 - 3:42:18)
All right. Tyler, do we have a letter of support from Alderman Gardner? Yes.

Okay. Will you make sure that we have it on our file? I don't have it recorded as received.

So would you email that to the committee, please?

[Speaker 37] (3:42:18 - 3:42:20)
Yeah, I'll resend that to Raymond and Nicole.

[Speaker 1] (3:42:21 - 3:42:30)

Proceed. Alderman, we can't hear you.

[Speaker 1] (3:43:41 - 3:43:44)

Paul, check the volume on your computer, maybe.

[Speaker 53] (3:44:21 - 3:44:23)
Hi, Alderman. Can you hear me?

[Speaker 12] (3:44:26 - 3:44:30)
Unfortunately, when you switched us to a panelist, our microphone got shut off.

[Speaker 18] (3:44:30 - 3:44:32)
And now we can't hear you guys.

[Speaker 1] (3:44:34 - 3:44:50)
All right, well, that's not good. So we will. I can hear you and you cannot hear me.

Alderman, can you hear me now? I can hear you loud and clear. Can you hear me?

[Speaker 8] (3:44:50 - 3:44:51)
Now we can hear you.

[Speaker 1] (3:44:52 - 3:45:09)

Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the board. My name is Paul Kopach. I represent the applicant, Daniel Middlescue.

We're requesting a zoning change from the current RS-3 residential single unit detached housing district to that of an RM-4.5 residential multi-unit district. Purpose of the zoning change is to allow the division of lots 12 and 13 to construct a new masonry three-story, three-dwelling unit building with finished basement on lot 13 and to legalize the existing three-and-a-half-story building on lot 12. That will remain as built.

We met with the community group actually on the site and we have a letter of support from the alderman and I'm prepared to answer any questions if there are.

[Speaker 1] (3:46:00 - 3:46:08)
Paul, would you make sure that you email that letter of support from Alderman Rosa, Ramirez-Rosa?

[Speaker 8] (3:46:11 - 3:46:13)
I don't know why we're not hearing you well.

[Speaker 1] (3:46:18 - 3:46:24)
I think my committee members can hear me. Can you not, committee members? Yeah, we can hear you.

[Speaker 13] (3:46:24 - 3:46:29)
We can hear you just fine. Okay, I hear you. They probably need to log off and log back on.

[Speaker 1] (3:46:31 - 3:46:44)
Paul, can you hear me? I can hear you now, alderman. All right, well stay where you're at.

Don't move. Okay. All right, so would you make sure that you send us that letter of support from Carlos Rosa, the alderman?

[Speaker 8] (3:46:44 - 3:46:54)
Yes, I will. In fact, we'll do it. We'll send it out to Raymond and Nicole in a few moments.

Okay, all right. Questions from committee members?

[Speaker 1] (3:46:57 - 3:47:03)

[Speaker 31] (3:49:11 - 3:49:15)
And I'm prepared to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (3:49:16 - 3:49:22)
Thank you, Paul. We have a letter of support from Alderman Villegas. Alderman, would you like to say a few words on the item?

[Speaker 38] (3:49:23 - 3:49:24)
No, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 22] (3:49:24 - 3:49:26)
I would just like to have consideration of the committee.

[Speaker 1] (3:49:27 - 3:49:39)

[Speaker 1] (3:49:57 - 3:50:33)
Paul, stay with me. I think I've got one more with you. Correct.

Top of page seven. Document for 20427-T1. In the 45th Ward, the ordinance was referred on June 17th of 2020.

The common address is 4837 through 4841 North Lips Avenue. The change requests 332 Community Shopping District to a C13 neighborhood commercial district.

[Speaker 8] (3:50:34 - 3:57:38)
Paul Kolpak. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the board. My name is Paul Kolpak.

I represent the applicant 4841 Lips, LLC. Our change request is going from the current B3-2 Community Shopping District to that of the C1-3 neighborhood commercial district. The purpose is to develop a mixed-use development with nine apartments and one restaurant brew pub.

This property is currently owned by the city of Chicago. And I know, Alderman, you'd like to have this brief, but I think that the timeline which I had sent to your office is appropriate to be read into the record, if you don't mind. Proceed.

Okay. This project started in November of 2016 when we approached the then-Alderman Arena and requested the ability to change the zoning district. Back in April of 2017, then Ed O'Bannon, who was part of Alderman Arena's economic development team, put together a request for proposals, which were sent out.

We then proposed our concept. The detailed version of that concept was four stories, nine apartments, and we received no input on that at all. We continued to work with Lake Effect Brewery to be the first floor tenant.

At that point, in September of 2017, city's planning department asked Ambrosia to update the negotiated sales documents for the city review. In January of 2018, the city department of planning requested even more information from Ambrosia, and we had conference calls with the city and the planning department. At that time, they suggested a community meeting with the neighbors of Jefferson Park.

In March of that year, my client met with the Northwest Side Historical Society at the Alderman's office, and at that point, the historical group stated that they were happy that the company would invest in this project, but it had a reservation of the look of this project. Then later in March of that year of 2018, there was a community meeting at the Copernicus Center about this project. My client and Lake Effect presented the project to at least 200 people in attendance, including the future Alderman, Alderman Gardner.

At that point, the presentation was well received. The city of Chicago asked my client to pay for an appraisal, to update the appraisal for the property, which we did. In August of 2018, the city granted Ambrosia Homes ongoing access to the building.

We provided certificates of insurance and bond buying access agreements. In the fall of 2018, my client paid for and completed an environmental phase one study, provided it to the city. Our consultants noted that there was a buried underground storage tank on the property, asbestos present and a significant amount of lead paint had been disturbed due to how the building had been winterized.

In December of 18, the Alderman's office mentioned to my client that the local historical group has concerns about the look of the building. We then met with that historical group and made changes to the building and they backed our new plan. In February of 19, we met with the building department and found out about additional requirements to complete the proposal since the building had been industrial.

In approximately April, we paid for a phase two and ordered a contaminated materials survey, which we did and gave that to the city. We then continued to solicit bids for the asbestos removal, lead paint removal, and share these bids with the representatives of the city's planning department. In March of 19, the city committed to remove the underground storage tank prior to my client purchasing the property.

The final plan that you see in front of us is now a three-story building, nine units of residential with Lake Effect Brewery as first floor tenant. With the new plan, we met with the Preservation Chicago and North Side Historical Societies in person. Plan is well received, but there are other changes that they wish us to make, which we do in March of 19.

In spring of 19, both the Preservation Chicago and Northwest Side Historical Societies send letters of support for this project. In June of 19, the city of Chicago has indicated that they will remove the underground storage tank. And we now, in June of 19, meet with Alderman Gardner.

We bring the alderman up to date of the extent of damage inside due to the status of the lead paint. We now, in August of 19, Alderman Gardner provides us a temporary letter of support for the project addressed to the building department so that we can continue to work with the building department towards a negotiated sale. In March of 2020, Jim Wheaton is assigned to the project from the Department of Housing.

In April of this year, the project's reviewed and the sale approved to my client by the internal groups at the Department of Buildings and Department of Housing. The Department of Housing permits the Department of Zoning to accept it. In May of this year, an application on behalf of my client for the purchase of the project.

In June of this year, we complete the drawings and submit them to the city for zoning change. In June of this year, my client works with Jim Wheaton to prepare for the Community Development Commission meeting. We send letters for WBE and MBE contractors who may be interested in working on the future projects.

In July of this year, the CDC unanimously approves the sale of the property to my client and to formally publish the notice. This goes to emphasize how long my client has been working with the city, everything he's done to obtain community city support. I stand to answer any questions if there are any from the committee.

All right, do we have questions from the committee?

[Speaker 1] (3:57:40 - 3:58:17)
We've gotten a verbal email or the verbal recognition from Carlton Gardner that he supports the project. I believe we had a public comment person on this issue. I'm gonna ask Patrick Murphy here to comment on the RFP process probably separate and distinct from the zoning process.

Patrick, I know Paul Colpac has given a detailed outline, but I thought there was some concern from some of the neighbors about lack of notice.

[Speaker 36] (3:58:19 - 3:58:22)
So this is Patrick Murphy. I am from the Department of Planning.

[Speaker 17] (3:58:22 - 3:58:37)
I don't have the information on the RFP or the notice process related to that property that was not part of the zoning process. I'll get staff from the Department of Planning and follow that up with the chairman on that, but I do not have that information.

[Speaker 1] (3:58:42 - 3:58:58)
You mentioned specifically, it's for the enlightenment of our committee members. The RFP process, say it again, is separate and distinct from the zoning process. So we have it on the record, sir.

Yes, sir.

[Speaker 17] (3:58:58 - 3:59:04)
The RFP process for the land sale is separate from the zoning map amendment process.

[Speaker 1] (3:59:05 - 3:59:12)
And I think this was a fire station slash ward yard, correct? Yes, sir.

[Speaker 17] (3:59:12 - 3:59:12)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (3:59:13 - 3:59:38)
And many of us that have had to dispose of city property, as the attorney Paul Colpac said, it's a very, my understanding is a pretty lengthy process to go through the actual sale of something that requires some kind of RFP by the Department of Housing or Plan, and I'm sorry, by the Department of Planning and Development.

[Speaker 17] (3:59:41 - 3:59:51)
Correct? Yes, sir. That is absolutely correct.

I don't know the exact link for this transaction, but I will follow up with the committee on that.

[Speaker 1] (3:59:52 - 4:00:00)
Okay. So the question for the attorney Paul Colpac. Paul?

[Speaker 5] (4:00:06 - 4:00:12)
Paul Colpac. You're muted again.

[Speaker 8] (4:00:20 - 4:01:33)
Okay. Alderman, can you hear me now? Yes.

So Alderman, I actually listened to the comments earlier this morning about not notice, and I did send to your office to Raymond and Nicole, emails that I have received from the records from the then Alderman Arena's office. The gentleman who testified indicated that he did not have an opportunity to present or know about it, yet I have an email dated March 14th to the Alderman's office from the attorney for the protester indicating, he says, please see the development package. Call me if you have any questions.

Then on May 1st, the same law firm sends a letter to Mr. Bannon indicating it's May 15th deadline to submit proposals to the firehouse. Paul? Yes.

[Speaker 1] (4:01:33 - 4:01:36)
Just, would you make sure that we have those records?

[Speaker 8] (4:01:36 - 4:01:44)
I did. I sent them today this morning when I heard the protesters. They should be up in the office.

[Speaker 1] (4:01:45 - 4:02:03)
Thank you. All right, any questions from committee members? Hearing none, we do have the letter of support via Gardner.

No questions by committee members. Do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 71] (4:02:03 - 4:02:04)
We move to pass.

[Speaker 1] (4:02:05 - 4:03:09)
Alderman Riley moves to pass. Any objections? Hearing none, item is passed.

Thank you, Paul. All right, now we're in the middle of page seven. Document number 20423T1, 35th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on June 17th of 2020. Common address 3130 to 3132 North Spaulding Avenue. The change requests an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RT3.5 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district. We have Fred on behalf of that, but before we ask Fred to speak, we do have a substitute ordinance on Alderman Riley's storefront protection. It's been emailed to all the committee members, so we're gonna bring that back up too. All right, Fred, you wanna talk about the 35th Ward, please, on Spaulding?

[Speaker 61] (4:03:09 - 4:04:22)
Sure, thank you, Alderman. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. For the record, my name is Fred Augustin.

I'm the attorney on this matter. I'm here today on behalf of the applicant, PDL Real Estate LLC. Applicant owns the property at 3130 to 32 North Spaulding.

The property is a double lot measuring 50 feet wide by 123 feet deep. It's currently improved with a two flat and a two car garage on one lot and another two car garage on the second lot. Both lots form one zoning lot.

We are here seeking rezoning from the current RS3 district to an RT3.5 district. And the reason for this change is to allow the subdivision of the one zoning lot into two separate zoning lots where the two flat and the two car garage will remain on one lot while the second lot will be redeveloped with a new single family home with a two car garage. We have worked with Alderman Ramirez-Rosa and his office on this matter.

We did present the project before a local community via conference call. All were in support of the zoning change. You should have a letter of no objection from the Alderman's office.

I'm here to answer any questions the committee may have.

[Speaker 1] (4:04:23 - 4:04:40)
Fred, we do have a letter of support from Alderman Ramirez-Rosa. Questions by committee members? Can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to establish or determine quorum?

[Speaker 13] (4:04:40 - 4:04:42)
So moved, Alderwoman Hatton.

[Speaker 1] (4:04:42 - 4:04:51)
Alderwoman Hatton moves to pass. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

All right.

[Speaker 71] (4:04:51 - 4:04:52)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (4:04:52 - 4:05:44)
Thank you, Fred. Bottom of page seven. And after this item, we're going to go back to Alderman Riley, just FYI by committee members.

Would you please unmute in the background? Document number 20421-T1, 43rd Ward. Ordinance was referred on June 17th of 2020.

The common address, 1754 North Clark Street. The change request, a B3-5 community shopping district to a B3-5 community shopping district. And it really is an extension of an existing type one.

I'm going to ask Kate Duncan to present to the committee.

[Speaker 19] (4:05:46 - 4:07:32)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Kate Duncan.

And I'm an attorney that is appearing on behalf of the applicant in this matter, Giordano Dance Chicago, in connection with application number 20420. The subject property bears the address, 1754 North Clark Street. In November of 2017, this property was rezoned to a B3-5 community shopping district in order to allow for the use of the property as a new headquarters for the applicant, Giordano Dance Chicago.

The ordinance was a type one ordinance. And in accordance with the zoning code, type one ordinances are good for a period of two years. Since the time the original application was approved, Giordano Dance has moved its executive offices into the existing building, which is the former Herman Baptist Church, but is still in the process of fundraising for the proposed new building and needs some additional time to construct the proposed building in accordance with the original type one ordinance.

Accordingly, we are here today to request an extension of the 2017 type one ordinance with the B3-5 zoning classification. Applicant is not proposing any changes to the 2017 type one ordinance and still seeks to construct the building in accordance with the originally submitted plans. The proposed building will have three studio and rehearsal spaces and will also have some retail on the ground floor and the maximum height of the building is 70 feet.

This property is located in Alderman Michelle Smith's ward. And in 2017, applicant had met extensively with the alderman and community residents before receiving the support of Alderman Smith. Since that time, the applicant has stayed in close connection with the alderman about the status of the proposed project.

And it's our understanding that the alderman is still in full support of the project. I'm here to answer any questions you may have.

[Speaker 1] (4:07:33 - 4:08:00)
Thank you, Kate. I think I was supportive of this project a couple of years ago. This is the church, originally a church on North Clark that is being expanded and such.

It was actually enthusiastically approved back then. Was there a fundraising problem with this that makes it extended?

[Speaker 19] (4:08:01 - 4:08:10)
I think they're still working on the fundraising. Two years went fast, I think for this applicant. And so they're still working on it but they still intend to construct the building.

[Speaker 1] (4:08:11 - 4:08:27)
Okay, so I know we have Alderman Smith's representative, Joanna Zayden. Is there anything more you want to bring to the committee's attention? Joanna.

[Speaker 17] (4:08:28 - 4:08:28)
Hi, Chairman.

[Speaker 18] (4:08:29 - 4:08:42)
Yes, this is Joanna Zayden. I'm the alderman's head of zoning for the 43rd Ward. And unfortunately, the alderman had to leave the meeting but she wanted me to say that we remain in full support of this application.

[Speaker 1] (4:08:46 - 4:08:53)
Questions for the applicant or the representative from Joanna from 43?

[Speaker 5] (4:08:54 - 4:08:56)
Alderman Riley moves to pass.

[Speaker 1] (4:08:56 - 4:09:14)
Okay, without any questions, more questions by committee members. Alderman Riley moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, the item is passed. Thank you.

[Speaker 68] (4:09:14 - 4:09:15)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (4:09:15 - 4:09:19)
Okay, now we're on the top of page eight.

[Speaker 68] (4:09:19 - 4:09:20)
We're going back to Riley.

[Speaker 1] (4:09:20 - 4:10:17)
Oh, I'm sorry. Alderman Riley, you were very aggressive about that because you really want to be heard on a substitute or whatever. So let me correct it into the records.

Let me just see. Moving or back to TAD 600 introduced by Alderman Riley on June 17th of 2020. The amendment of the municipal code 17-4 by adding new section 17-4-1100 to establish requirements for roll up overhead or sliding security gates or doors.

Alderman Raboyas moves to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing no objections, the substitute is accepted.

Alderman Riley.

[Speaker 5] (4:10:18 - 4:12:16)
Thank you, Chairman. As requested by our colleagues on the zoning committee, we've reworked the substitute ordinance to be more narrowly defined. And I will, for the record, read it quickly.

17-4-1100 roll up overhead or sliding security gates or doors in the area bounded by the parcels adjacent to the south side of Wacker Drive to the north, parcels adjacent to the west side of Franklin Street to the west, parcels adjacent to the north side of Adams Street Avenue to the east. Any roll up overhead or sliding door, security door or gate installed after July 30th, 2020 for ground floor retail or commercial uses located in any building must be located inside of any storefront window, be clear and non-reflective, allowing views of indoor commercial space or product display areas, and three, comply with any transparency requirements, including section 17-4-504C for the terms of any plan development ordinance as applicable. This ordinance shall be effective upon passage and publication. So essentially, this creates a much smaller box, basically bounded by Wacker Drive on the north, Adams Street on the south, Franklin on the west, and Michigan Avenue to the east.

So it literally is a square entirely contained within the boundaries of the 42nd Ward. By more narrowly tailoring this, this allows my colleagues in the 3rd, 4th, 27th, 43rd, and 2nd Wards to socialize this kind of idea with shop owners that they represent, but in the Igloo Loop Alliance, which represents the boundaries of this ordinance, is very much in favor of. I'd be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (4:12:18 - 4:12:22)
Thank you, Alderman Rod Sawyer.

[Speaker 5] (4:12:23 - 4:12:24)
Yes, thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 14] (4:12:24 - 4:12:55)
I just had a quick question. I was trying to just understand it. I'm fine with it, but you're saying that the protective coverings, whether the shades or the shutters have to be on the inside of the window?

Yes. So they would not protect. I'm a rabble rouser.

I throw a brick. I break the window, but I'm just curious to know why would you not want that protected?

[Speaker 5] (4:12:57 - 4:13:14)
Again, this was brought to me by the Business Association that represents the Loop. They represent hundreds of store owners and landlords. This was what they recommended that I incorporate into the ordinance.

So I'm deferring to the business owners that would be governed within that boundary. It wasn't a lot of protection.

[Speaker 14] (4:13:14 - 4:13:22)
I'm fine. I mean, if that's what they want, that's fine. I was just curious.

It seemed like you would want to have a protective covering outside the window.

[Speaker 5] (4:13:23 - 4:13:44)
You might think so, but I believe that the way the technology works is such it's more effective on the interior. So they may break the pane of glass, but they won't be able to gain entry to the business itself. But again, I took that language as a recommendation from the business group, not my own.

No problem. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (4:13:45 - 4:14:01)
Alderman, and I know that I got a chance to see some of the examples. I think that might behoove our colleagues to see the aesthetic and the protective natures of what you're proposing in your ward. Alderman Ray Lopez.

[Speaker 4] (4:14:04 - 4:15:16)
Thank you, Chairman. And I want to thank Alderman Riley for sharing his substitute and for during our break talking with me about this. I personally believe this should be a citywide matter, especially for neighborhoods like the ones that I represent on the Southwest side, neighborhoods that that steel gate sends a very negative message to people looking to invest in communities or even to the residents who think that, you know, they are living quite literally in a ghetto with those steel gates coming down.

They deserve to have the same kind of opportunities and the same kind of look as we see downtown. And while I'm not going to oppose this, I do look forward to working with Alderman Riley to ensure that we could bring this to the rest of our neighborhoods because the best way to show life is to show it. And you can see it through a transparent and safe plexiglass protective rolling gate in neighborhoods too.

So look forward to that. And hopefully this committee will come back in a few months and address that very issue next. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 5] (4:15:17 - 4:16:21)
Chairman, if I could. Alderman Riley. Yeah, Chairman, I thank you, Alderman Lopez, for the compliment and for agreeing to support the ordinance.

Again, I just want to make it very clear for the record that this will not apply retroactively. So for those storefronts that already have these gates in place, I plan to make it my endeavor to engage with those business owners and see if we can find some affordable solutions for them that they can voluntarily upgrade their storefronts with. But at least with this ordinance and future ordinances that may govern your ward, Alderman Lopez, or others, at least moving forward, if folks choose to install those security measures, they'll be held to that aesthetic standard.

So I've got to do some work with the folks that are already grandfathered in. These exist in my ward too. And that'll be more of a voluntary, hey, let's work together type of arrangement.

But at least moving forward, these will have to meet a certain standard.

[Speaker 1] (4:16:24 - 4:16:38)
Thank you, Alderman Riley. No more questions by committee members. Do I hear a motion to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

I'll move the chairman to pass. I'll move Alderman Wagesbeck, I believe.

[Speaker 11] (4:16:38 - 4:16:39)
Hold on one moment.

[Speaker 1] (4:16:40 - 4:16:42)
Move to pass. Any objections?

[Speaker 11] (4:16:42 - 4:16:43)
No objections.

[Speaker 1] (4:16:44 - 4:16:49)
Hearing none. The item is passed as amended. Thank you.

Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 5] (4:16:49 - 4:16:51)
All right. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (4:16:51 - 4:17:19)
Now we're in the top of page eight. And we are on item number 20422, 46th Ward. Ordinance was referred on June 17th of 2020.

Common address, 827 through 837 West Wilson Avenue. Change request, B35, Community Shopping District to B25, Neighborhood Mixed Use District. Steve Friedland.

Yes.

[Speaker 40] (4:17:19 - 4:17:20)
Can you hear me, Alderman?

[Speaker 1] (4:17:21 - 4:17:21)
We can.

[Speaker 40] (4:17:21 - 4:19:46)
Thank you. Great. Thank you so much.

This is a request for the property at 827 to 837 West Wilson. By the way, I should state for the record, my name is Steve Friedland. I'm an attorney with the law firm of Applegate and Thornton Thompson.

You're representing Brinshore Development. The purpose of this rezoning is to allow Brinshore to develop a new six-story, 73-unit, affordable senior residential development on what is currently a vacant lot. The need for the change is to allow for ground floor residential use.

This is going to be a 100% residential building with no commercial space, hence the need to go to the B2. As you can see from the drawing here of our site plan, this property sits directly west of the existing Lakeview Towers property, which is an approximately 20-some story building. It is owned by a residence association.

And I should note that some of the basis of getting this done and financing this affordable project is coming from the generous financial support of that residence association. They are providing some of the proceeds from a recent loan financing to allow this affordable housing development to be developed. There will be 44 parking spaces.

You can probably just jump to maybe the last drawing there. You see what's helpful, I think, is if our last slide. Yeah, this is a rendering of what the project's going to look like along Wilson Avenue.

I would also note to the committee that because of the proximity of this property to the lakefront, it's in the lakefront protection ordinance district. So we have also filed an application with the plan commission for lakefront approval and we will get that heard by them. But this request before you is for the B3-5 to B2-5 zoning.

We have met with Alderman Kappelman. I believe he was on here at the meeting though. I believe you also have a letter of support in the file from him.

And I would certainly be happy to take any questions the committee might have.

[Speaker 1] (4:19:48 - 4:19:59)
Thank you, Steve. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Kappelman, but I think I see him on the... Alderman Kappelman, thank you for your patience.

[Speaker 65] (4:20:00 - 4:21:02)
Sure. I've worked with Steven Samoa. He's the president of Lakeview Towers, probably for the past three or four years.

As my colleagues know, it is extraordinarily difficult to get affordable housing. There's many layers of financing and there's all different types of hoops to jump through. But this is something that I'm very proud to have in this ward.

East Lakeview, not East Lakeview, Lakeview Towers has just an incredible building that provides affordable housing. And with other residents in other parts of the ward who are hesitant to have affordable housing in their ward, I always encourage them to go to Lakeview Towers to see for themselves what good affordable housing is like. And so I was delighted to have Steven as a part of this endeavor.

And it's going to be run really well. My community supports it as well. So I ask my colleagues to support it.

[Speaker 1] (4:21:02 - 4:21:29)
Thank you, Alderman. Do we have any questions from committee members for the Alderman or the applicants? Do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

That was Alderman Roboius. Moves do pass. Any objections?

Hearing none, the item is passed.

[Speaker 40] (4:21:29 - 4:21:31)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (4:21:31 - 4:21:58)
And it's a very nice, handsome project, Alderman Kaplan. So congratulations. All right, middle of page eight, document number 20425, 47th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on June 17th of 2020. Common address 3226 North Lincoln Avenue. The change request, B33, Community Shopping District to a C13, Neighborhood Commercial District.

Ed Cuss, Ed?

[Speaker 51] (4:21:58 - 4:21:59)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (4:22:00 - 4:22:00)
Yes, we can.

[Speaker 51] (4:22:01 - 4:23:53)
Great, thank you. For the record, my name is Ed Cuss with the Taft Law Firm. I'm appearing this afternoon on behalf of the applicant, Lincoln Melrose, LLC, for the property located at 3226 North Lincoln Avenue.

We are requesting a zoning change from B3-3 to C1-3 for the sole purpose of obtaining an amusement license, the appropriate licenses for an amusement arcade. There's an existing four-story mixed-use building. There will be no physical changes to that building except for the interior space on the ground floor.

The first floor will be used by an operator who operates what's known as e-sports. And until I undertook this case, I really had no idea what e-sports were, but apparently it's competition with other people using your computer screens. So you will have this space by the operator with about 50 computer screens and people pay to come in and use them and participate in various competitions in various sports.

The applicant and potential operator met with the community group a few months ago. And I know we have a letter of support from Alderman Martin on this. For the record, there was also a memorandum of understanding between the proposed operator of the e-sports and the alderman in which they would not serve with or on the premises.

And they would always maintain fully transparent windows at the pedestrian level as requested by the Chamber of Commerce. And the business would close to the public no later than 11 p.m. So in essence, we are requesting your support for the zoning change and I am happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (4:23:53 - 4:24:20)
Thank you, Ed. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Martin. I don't think Alderman is still on the call.

I don't see him, but we do have a letter of support from Alderman Martin on that application. Any questions by committee members? Do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 11] (4:24:21 - 4:24:21)
So moved.

[Speaker 1] (4:24:22 - 4:24:30)
Alderman Burnett, moves do pass. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

[Speaker 51] (4:24:30 - 4:24:32)
Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (4:24:32 - 4:25:33)
Quid. All right, now we're in the middle of page nine. Document number 20396, 10th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on April 22nd of 2020. 3000 through 3148 East, 122nd Street. The change request.

Plan Manufacturing District 6 to Waterway Industrial Plan Development. We have Liz Butler. All right, do we have Liz?

All right, Liz Butler.

[Speaker 12] (4:25:35 - 4:26:47)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Liz Butler from the law firm of DLA Piper, located at 444 West Lake Street. And I, along with my colleague, Rich Clowetter, represent NP Avenue O, LLC, the applicant for a plan development for the property located at 3044 East, 122nd Street.

NP Avenue O, LLC is an affiliate of Northpointe Development. I'm joined today by Christina Hubasek of Northpointe Development and Bill Bone of Jacob and Hefner Associates, the civil engineer for the project. The applicant is seeking to rezone the property from its current PMD 6 to an industrial waterway planned development to facilitate the development of the subject property with a 580,587 square foot Class A industrial building.

The proposed plan development was considered and recommended for approval by the Chicago Plan Commission on June 18th. And we would request that the transcript of those proceedings and the resolution from the plan commission be incorporated into the record here today.

[Speaker 1] (4:26:49 - 4:27:03)
Alderman Burnett moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the records are incorporated.

Continue, Liz.

[Speaker 12] (4:27:03 - 4:31:02)
Thank you. The subject property indicated in red on this diagram that's being shown right now is a portion of the approximately 200 acre site that's located at 118th Street and Avenue O, which Northpointe acquired in 2018. The site is the long vacant former location of the Republic Steel Mill.

Northpointe is developing the 200 acre overall property with a high quality industrial business park, which will include up to five state of the art Class A industrial buildings, which will be constructed in multiple phases. When complete, the center shown here is a view of the overall development with the subject property highlighted again in red. When complete, the overall park will contain roughly 2.2 million square feet of industrial space and will create as many as 660 permanent jobs. This will be the largest industrial development in Chicago since the creation of the neighboring 1.6 million square foot forest supplier park, which now is also owned by Northpointe. The property that is the subject of the proposal before you today is a 48.6 acre portion of the overall park. This portion of the property is separated from the remainder of the site by the South Chicago and Southern Railroad right of way and is abutting the Calumet River on the west.

It's currently vacant and unimproved. Northpointe is proposing to construct, like I mentioned, a 580,587 square foot Class A industrial building. Upon the subject property, the building will measure 51 feet in height.

The project includes 384 vehicular parking spaces, 136 trailer parking spaces, 56 loading spaces and 26 bicycle parking spaces. Maybe we could turn quickly back to the site plan just to say that the site plan does provide generous landscaping throughout the site, including a 30 to 35 foot landscaped setback along the west side of the site from the river. A total of 575 trees are provided and approximately 18 acres of naturalized area.

122nd Street at the south perimeter of the site is unimproved at this location. The applicant is constructing 122nd Street as part of this project and is also constructing portions of Burley Avenue. The roadways have been designed by the applicant to meet with CDOT's phase one roadway design for this area.

The project is going to redevelop a long, vacant and blighted parcel of the project that's going to generate approximately 130 to 150 construction jobs. And this building will generate anywhere from 174 to 200 permanent full-time jobs. Clayco is the GC for this project and North Point has established hiring goals for the project of 26% MBE, 6% WBE, 50% city of Chicago resident hiring and 10% 10th Ward resident hiring.

The applicant has worked closely with Alderman Garza and the Department of Planning and Development on this project. I'm hoping that Alderman Garza is still on the line. We know that she is in support of the plan development and I'm hoping that she is in attendance still to make remarks.

We respectfully request that this committee recommends city council approval of the application and we appreciate your time and consideration of this project. And we're available to answer any questions that the committee may have. Thank you.

[Speaker 56] (4:31:02 - 4:31:03)
Thank you, Liz.

[Speaker 1] (4:31:03 - 4:31:49)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Garza and are there any questions for the team on this one? All right. So no questions by committee members.

Alderman Pat Dowell moves due pass as revised and that motion would be on the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. So Alderman Dowell moves due pass. Any objections?

Hearing none, the item is passed as revised. Thank you, Liz.

[Speaker 12] (4:31:49 - 4:31:50)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (4:31:51 - 4:32:20)
All right. Now we're on the bottom of page nine, document number 20298 in the 27th ward. The ordinance was referred on December 18th of 2019.

Common address, 1200 West Carroll. Change request, M23 Light Industry District to a DX5 Downtown Mixed Use District and then to a business plan development. Katie Jenke Dale.

[Speaker 53] (4:32:21 - 4:32:48)
Thank you. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Katie Jenke Dale from the law firm of the LA Piper and along with my colleague, Rich Clowder, we represent the applicant in this matter, 1200 Carroll LLC.

As a preliminary matter, this application was heard by the Planning Commission on June 18th, 2020. We would request that the record of those proceedings be incorporated into the record here today.

[Speaker 1] (4:32:49 - 4:33:01)
All right. Alderman David Moore moves to incorporate the records from the Planning Commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

[Speaker 15] (4:33:02 - 4:33:02)
No.

[Speaker 1] (4:33:03 - 4:33:09)
Hearing none, the records are incorporated. Continue, Katie. Thank you.

[Speaker 53] (4:33:09 - 4:34:29)
The property is currently zoned M23 and located at the northwest corner of Carroll and Racine. We're requesting to take it to a DX5 and then to a business plan development to allow for the construction of a 14-story commercial building with approximately 90 parking spaces. As part of the plan development, we'd be seeking approval of a 3.1 FAR bonus, which results in a payment into the Neighborhood Opportunity Bonus Fund of over 4.3 million. We would also be subject to the Industrial Corridor Conversion Fee resulting in a payment into that fund of approximately 734,000. The project is anticipated to create approximately 359 construction jobs and 2,440 permanent jobs once completed. We've worked very closely with Alderman Burnett as well as the various community groups.

I believe Alderman Burnett was planning on attending today and speaking on this matter. We appreciate your time and consideration of this matter and respectfully request your approval. Also joined today, I should add, by representatives from Project Architect Gensler as well as from the applicants, Sterling Bay, if there are any questions for any of them.

Thank you very much for your consideration and hopefully positive recommendation.

[Speaker 1] (4:34:30 - 4:34:47)
Thank you, Katie. We did... That was the Planning Commission, right?

We did that? Okay. Alderman Burnett.

Walter, we're on... He's muted. You're muted.

We're on Carol.

[Speaker 11] (4:34:48 - 4:35:26)
Okay, fantastic. Thank you all very much. So they met with myself and members of the community.

Everyone support the project. We had a community meeting. If I'm not mistaken, the community asked for a couple of things and they adhered to it.

This developer works for my community very well. They are considering hiring a joint... Doing a joint venture with African-American contractor, which is great and hiring people from the community.

I support this as that the body supported also. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (4:35:28 - 4:35:55)
Thank you, Alderman. Questions from committee members or comments? I do want to make a comment, Walter.

It's a stunning piece of architecture. I just, you know, you see a lot of projects, but it certainly is unique and I hope it... I'm sure it will stand the test of time.

Questions? Brendan, Alderman Riley.

[Speaker 5] (4:35:56 - 4:36:00)
Thank you, Chairman. Could you remind me what the address is for this project again?

[Speaker 1] (4:36:00 - 4:36:02)
1200 West Carroll.

[Speaker 5] (4:36:02 - 4:36:06)
Great, thank you. Looks great and congratulations, Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 1] (4:36:07 - 4:37:10)
Okay, any questions or comments from committee members? If not, I want a motion. Do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Do pass. Alderman Riley moves to pass. Any objections?

Hearing none, the item is passed as revised. Thank you. All right.

Now we're on the top of page 10 and we are in the 27th ward. The document number 20371. In the 27th ward, the ordinance was referred on April 22nd of 2020.

The common address of this one is 932 through 940 West Randolph Street and also 150 to 154 North Sangamon Street. Change request. C12, Neighborhood Commercial District to a DX5, Downtown Mixed Use District.

Kate Duncan.

[Speaker 19] (4:37:12 - 4:37:55)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Kate Duncan and I'm an attorney with Aikerman. I'm appearing this afternoon on behalf of the applicant L3-932W Randolph LLC in connection with application number 20371.

The subject property is located at 932 to 940 West Randolph Street and 150 to 154 North Sangamon Street. It's currently located in the C12 Neighborhood Commercial District. The applicant has filed this application for a zoning amendment in order to reclassify the property to DX5, Downtown Mixed Use District.

Mr. Chairman, we do have a substitute narrative and plans that are on file with the Zoning Department and I would ask that you please adopt those herein.

[Speaker 1] (4:37:56 - 4:38:12)
So Alderman Roboius moves to accept the substantive narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Move. Questions?

Okay. Thank you, Alderman. Hearing none, the substitute narrative and plans are accepted.

[Speaker 19] (4:38:12 - 4:39:29)
Thank you. Kate? Okay, thank you.

This property is located within the historic Fulton Randolph Market District and it is a non-contributing building in that district. The property is also located in the proposed expansion area for the DX5. The subject property contains an existing three-story building that was formerly used as a bank and offices and the applicant is actually proposing to renovate that existing three-story building, including a small addition onto the existing building to create a three-story masonry glass and steel building that conforms better with the character of the neighborhood.

The applicant has submitted this application as a type one amendment, so all drawings for the proposed renovation of the existing building and the addition are incorporated into the ordinance. Applicant proposes to use the building for retail on the ground floor with boutique office space on the second and third floors. The property is located in Alderman Walter Burnett's ward and the applicant has met with the West Central Association, the Neighbors of the West Loop and the West Loop Community Organization and has received the support of all three of those organizations and I believe the alderman is here today to speak on his behalf.

And on behalf of my client, I would respectfully request your favorable recommendation and I'm happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (4:39:31 - 4:39:37)
All right. Alderman Burnett, this is your ward.

[Speaker 11] (4:39:38 - 4:40:17)
Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. As the council has said, they did meet with community organizations, all three of them, and we also had a community meeting, community meetings on this. This is not a big deal in this community, it may be in other communities, but the young developers, they're young and ambitious and very cooperative.

They committed to working with minority contractors and hiring people from the community. The community support this, I support this, and I ask that this body support it also.

[Speaker 1] (4:40:18 - 4:40:44)
Thank you, Alderman. Questions from committee members? I have Alderman Ray Lopez.

Are you about your hand up on this one? No, that was my error. I think the only thing that I wanted to ask, Kate, there's no slides with this one?

[Speaker 19] (4:40:44 - 4:40:56)
You know, I guess I didn't submit any slides for this. I can submit drawings over to Nicole and Raymond if you would like me to do so.

[Speaker 1] (4:40:56 - 4:41:06)
Oh, I mean, the Alderman has spoken, but I think more of the question was, was this in the context with the Fulton Historical? Did I hear that in your narrative?

[Speaker 19] (4:41:07 - 4:41:36)
Yeah, so this building is a non-contributing building in the Fulton Market, the Fulton Randolph Market District, and we actually have been working with Landmarks and will eventually go before the Permit Review Committee of the Landmarks Commission because this building needs to conform with the character of the community and of the historic district. And so we've worked to make sure that the new, we're sort of putting a new skin on the building and we've worked to make sure that it conforms with the character of the historic district.

[Speaker 11] (4:41:37 - 4:42:11)
Also, Mr. Chairman- Alderman Ryan, Alderman Burnett. Also, Mr. Chairman, they haven't taken advantage of all of the FAR that they could have in this area. So, as you can see, we're getting high rises in this community.

They're not trying to do a high rise. They're keeping it low. These guys aren't trying to bite off more than what they can chew.

And I appreciate them keeping the building in line with some of the existing buildings in the neighborhood.

[Speaker 1] (4:42:13 - 4:42:52)
Thank you, Alderman, for that clarification. And I just, I know they're working with Landmarks and I just think it behooves us as we consider landmarking in various parts that I know I've worked with you on the plan commission where you've been able to add density in landmark districts and in order to really help the economics of such projects. So I just thought it might be pretty interesting to have the slides so people can see how a non-contributing parcel can add to the integrity of the landmark district.

That was where I was going with that.

[Speaker 17] (4:42:53 - 4:42:53)
Sure.

[Speaker 1] (4:42:53 - 4:43:24)
Thank you. Okay. Any other questions for the applicant or Alderman Burnett?

Okay. No questions more. Do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

We'll move. Alderman Rabois moves to pass. Any objections?

No. Hearing none. The item is passed with substantive narrative and plans.

[Speaker 19] (4:43:24 - 4:43:25)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (4:43:26 - 4:43:58)
Thank you. All right. Middle of page 10.

Item number 20230. In the 22nd ward, the ordinance was referred on October 16th of 19. Common address 4930 through 5004 West 44th Street.

The change request. RS3 residential single unit detached house district to a C11 neighborhood commercial district and then to an institutional plan development. Amy Degnan.

[Speaker 18] (4:44:00 - 4:44:01)
Good afternoon.

[Speaker 1] (4:44:02 - 4:44:03)
My name is Amy.

[Speaker 18] (4:44:04 - 4:44:44)
Good afternoon, Chairman Tunney and members of the zoning committee. My name is Amy Degnan and I'm an attorney with Daly and Georges. I'm appearing today on behalf of the applicant Academy for Global Citizenship on application number 20230.

This application was presented to and received a favorable recommendation of the Chicago Plan Commission at its meeting on July 16th, 2020. I ask that the report of proceedings including a substitute ordinance as well as the reports and drawings previously transmitted to the plan commission and the department of planning and development be incorporated into and made part of this proceeding.

[Speaker 1] (4:44:45 - 4:45:28)
All right, Amy. Then we'll have two motions. Correct.

The first one. Alderman David Moore moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections on that one?

Hearing none. Those records are incorporated and then a follow up with that. We have Alderman Raboyas moves to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum and any objections to the substitute?

So move. Hearing no objections. The substitute is accepted.

Okay, continue.

[Speaker 18] (4:45:29 - 4:47:04)
Thank you. With us this afternoon is Erin Lavin-Kabanerji, the development advisor to the Academy for Global Citizenship as well as Alderman Michael Rodriguez who I believe will want to speak on the project. The project site is located at the 22nd Ward.

The site is approximately 6.2 acres and is bound on the north by I-55, on the west by Hearst Park, on the south by 44th Street and on the east by LaPorte Avenue. The Academy for Global Citizenship has been educating children on the southwest side for the last 12 years at two different leased locations. AGC is proposing to build a unified school campus for pre-K through eighth grade, including a net zero school building, a barn for agricultural learning and an institute for visiting professors and scholars.

The site was previously the LeClaire Corks owned by the Chicago Housing Authority. LeClaire Corks was demolished 10 years ago. Subject to the plan development approval, all bulk and use density items will be in compliance with the zoning ordinance.

The developer participated in a series of community meetings hosted by Alderman Michael Rodriguez to present the project and obtain community support. Alderman Rodriguez provided a letter of support with this application, as well as the Archer Heights Civic Association and the Bidham Park Civic League. I submitted those letters of support to the committee earlier this week.

We'd now like to go through the project with Erin Lavin-Cabanargy.

[Speaker 7] (4:47:06 - 4:54:45)
Thank you very much. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and committee members. My name is Erin Lavin-Cabanargy, for the record, to present the Academy for Global Citizen project to you.

As Amy mentioned, we're 12 years in the neighborhood. We have an enrollment of just under 500 students, which will expand, adding early childhood education as we consolidate these two campuses. This school is International Baccalaureate World School, as well as a dual language program.

It is public, tuition free and open to all residents of Chicago. AGC currently serves students who are 96% minority, 24% of whom are special needs. Additionally, 96% of the students live within five miles of the new campus.

AGC's goal is to have the students outside 30% of the day, and you'll see that reflected in the design of the entire campus itself. This area has been identified by the city as having limited access to grocery stores, higher food insecurity and higher diabetes hospitalization rates. The site, as you can see, and as Amy mentioned, is just over six acres in the former LeClaire Courts development.

I should state that we are also working very closely with Cabrera and Habitat, who are CHA's awarded redeveloper of that parceled immediately to the East, as well as to the Park District. The Park District has Hearst Park immediately to the west of our site. As Amy mentioned, this will not only be highly sustainable, this will be living building challenge certified.

There are only 24 other such buildings within the entire world. So it is a far higher level of sustainability achieved, and that's imbued and embedded into the educational program as well. So the site will be incorporated not only by the school building, but we have a learning barn and an institute for visiting fellows.

We have production greenhouses for year-round produce processing, community garden plots, teaching kitchens, farm store. We have a wind turbine, as well as educational greenhouses, et cetera. You'll see here the rendering that shows the respect to the urban street grid, re-establishing that urban street wall at 44th and La Porte.

In the rear of the site, as you look north towards the expressway and the rail lines, you're going to see 12 hoop houses that grow food production. This is a school that furnishes breakfast, lunch and snacks to all 500 of its students on a daily basis. Additionally, you'll see the barn and the production greenhouse, as well as the institute for visiting fellows.

I do want to point out our partnership with Erica Allen and the Urban Growers Collective who will facilitate the barn and production itself. This is the floor plan. It's a two-story building, nearly 72,000 square feet.

It's a central atrium with a pinwheel design intentionally developed in a way to encourage these students to go outside. There are entrances and exits in the four cardinal directions with wonderful view corridors and a tremendous layout that really just has a centrifugal force getting folks outside. This is the second floor plan.

One of the things I want to point out are the learning garden balconies, but one in particular to the north that has stairs and slide all the way out to encourage the students to get outside. The party here from an architectural standpoint pays homage to the continental divide, which is very close to the portage and water pathways that are a part of Chicago's history that are very close to the site. This is immediately south of the Stickney Water Purification Plant and a very vital part of the portage history of Chicago.

And so this design looks to the glacial pathways and the recession, leaving glacial drumlins in place that you'll see as we look at the elevations. We'll go quickly through these slides, but this is the pedestrian context at 44th Street. Here are a handful of elevations, very handsome building, attractive work with core tin steel or similar colored metal panels announcing the entrance, cementitious board panels.

Next slide, please. And then the north view shows that glacier and the drumlin that butts up against it. In the center, you can see the stairway and the slide that allows kids to literally slide out of the second floor of the school itself to get out to the constructed wetland, to get out to the hoop houses, to get out to the chickens and the goats, and maybe even a llama.

Next, you're seeing a handful of vantage points from throughout the campus itself. And this is a little bit more of the site development with hoop houses, earthen berms, wind turbine, et cetera. This is a series of renderings of both the Institute and the barn, all within the same color wave and materiality.

And a material palette where you can begin to see that. Wanted to share with you some of the community meetings that we've had. We've met not only with the Hearst community organization leaders, Archer Heights, as Amy mentioned, we have a series of letters of support.

We've also been to meet with the Federation of Women Contractors as well as HACIA and had virtual discussions with BCOE and BCU given the COVID pandemic. But we'll continue to work with all these assist agencies to the best that we can to bring them into the process of procurement. Forgive me.

This slide indicates the three and there are actually four agreements we're bound by in terms of our diversity and inclusion. There's a community benefits agreement, a CBA with CHA and community residents that was signed as a condition of the purchase and sale agreement for CHA to sell the property to the Academy for Global Citizenship. Second, and more recently, and with great thanks to the Alderman, we've negotiated a memorandum of understanding with the LeClaire Courts, local advisory council and the Hearst community organization.

And obviously, because this is a planned development, we'll be bound to executive order 2017-2. And fourth, and should have made the slide, my apologies, is the grant agreement with the state of Illinois. We're very grateful to the state of Illinois, specifically the Rebuild Illinois legislation that is affording $31 million to fund this project.

So as such, the floors, not the ceilings, the floors of our participation will include both business participation and workforce participation that includes the standard and aspiring to hire, but will also include the CHA section three resident-owned business engagement, as well as the CHA resident hiring provisions. The school itself will create both temporary jobs associated with construction, as well as permanent jobs on site. The permanent job creation will be roughly 25 to 30 additional staff members.

And the construction jobs, the temporary jobs are approximately 120 full-time equivalencies. But as you all know, construction is quite temporal. And so it will create between 960 people on site to 1,200 people on site as a result of this project.

We're happy to answer any questions that you may have. And we're grateful for your consideration and hope for your favorable ruling.

[Speaker 1] (4:54:47 - 4:55:09)
Thank you, Erin. And thank you for your many years of leadership on education. So I just wanted to say that for the record, you and I've worked together for a very long time, especially our dual language academy in Lakeview.

But I just wanted to say thank you again. We're going to hear from Alderman Michael Rodriguez before we take some questions.

[Speaker 9] (4:55:10 - 4:56:26)
Thank you, Chairman. And thank you for this opportunity to present. Thank you, Amy and Erin.

You know, we have a master plan, the community's developed that's called the Gateway to Midway that goes from the I-55 Expressway to Midway Airport along Cicero Avenue. Now I'm considering this first phase of the redevelopment of the Gateway to Midway. I'm excited to have this school coming in that'll have world-class elements to it, very positive learning environment for young people in our community.

And I'm also excited that the local neighborhood organizations are the three major resident organizing groups have either signed letters of support or in the case of the LeClaire Right to Return residents and the Hearst Community Organization, which is immediately adjacent to this development and the majority African-American community has signed on to a memorandum of understanding that further defines the participation, access to the building, collaboration, monthly meetings during construction.

So I'm excited to support this and urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this endeavor. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (4:56:28 - 4:56:34)
Thank you, Alderman. We have a couple of hands up. We'll start with Alderman Pat Dowell.

[Speaker 16] (4:56:35 - 4:57:55)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Hi, Erin. I didn't know anything about this school.

So I was doing a little bit of research online about this Academy for Global Citizenship and was also listening to you when you talked about diversity and inclusion and how you guys were approaching this project. And as I look at the website and I know you didn't really share the demographics of the students who attend here and I'd be interested in hearing that. What I noticed is that there are no, besides Erica, and it looks like a very large board, there are no African-Americans on the board.

There are no African-Americans as staff. And when we're talking about global citizenship, of course, African-Americans and Africans and all the black people in the diaspora are part of that tapestry. So I was wondering if you could speak to, I know this is a zoning matter, but I wanted, in order for me to support this, I would like to just understand more about your approach to diversity and inclusion in the school itself.

[Speaker 71] (4:58:11 - 4:58:12)
Pat, you're muted.

[Speaker 23] (4:58:14 - 4:58:19)
I see. Oh, no, she's going in and out. She's having technical difficulties.

[Speaker 13] (4:58:19 - 4:58:23)
Yeah, Alderman Dowell, you're muted again. You unmuted then remuted. Yes, okay.

[Speaker 16] (4:58:25 - 4:58:39)
I also see that this school is being built on land that housed the former residents of LeClaire Courts. So I just wanna get a little more understanding about the school itself.

[Speaker 18] (4:58:42 - 4:59:06)
Alderman, this is Amy Degnan. With Daly and Georges. The EGC, the student body for AGC is comprised of 96% minority.

And of that 24% are special needs students. They're also have a 96% of all of the students live within a five mile radius of the school. So it's really serving that Southwest corridor.

[Speaker 16] (4:59:07 - 4:59:14)
I mean, I can provide some- You break the 96 down for me. So I understand what you mean by minority.

[Speaker 18] (4:59:16 - 4:59:24)
You know, I can provide that detail through the chair. All I have is the 96%. I'm not sure, Erin, do you have more detail on the 96%?

[Speaker 7] (4:59:24 - 4:59:38)
I don't, I'm sorry to say. Okay, so- I can tell you that according to the Metro Agency for planning, this area is heavily Latino. But we can follow up as Amy mentioned.

[Speaker 18] (4:59:39 - 4:59:43)
Yes, we can provide a breakdown of the 96% through the chair.

[Speaker 16] (4:59:43 - 4:59:47)
Well, can you address my concern regarding the board and staff?

[Speaker 1] (4:59:51 - 4:59:58)
That question is for Amy and your team. The board and the staff breakdown.

[Speaker 16] (5:00:00 - 5:00:26)
The breakdown is visible on the website, Chairman. I just wanted to know if they had any plans since this is a school that focuses on global citizenship. And Erin's remarks were specific about diversity and inclusion, whether or not that value was going to be reflected in the operations of the school.

[Speaker 18] (5:00:28 - 5:00:57)
Alderman Dowell, thank you. Again, Amy Degnan with Daly and Georges. We can work with the Academy for Global Citizenship to again, provide some additional information through the chair about their staffing needs and desires and goals.

The two women that serve as the principals for the school are Hispanic. I don't have more of a breakdown today. I can, like I said, provide that through the chair along with the breakdown of the 96%.

[Speaker 16] (5:00:59 - 5:01:01)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 71] (5:01:02 - 5:01:02)
All right.

[Speaker 16] (5:01:02 - 5:01:13)
Amy, the only information I'm interested in at this point is the breakdown of the student body. The staffing board composition is evident on the website. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (5:01:14 - 5:01:18)
Thank you. Thank you, Alderman Dowell. Alderman Ray Lopez.

[Speaker 4] (5:01:21 - 5:05:35)
Thank you, Chairman. Again, members of the committee. For those of you who don't know, I actually grew up not three blocks from this location.

I remember when the LeClair Courts were the LeClair Courts. And I'm very familiar with the community and homeowners that are in the surrounding Hearst community. My grandfather actually was one of the military veterans who actually got some of the housing when that area was first created and bought and stayed and raised his family there as well.

So this area has always had a special place in my heart. But I am concerned. While I think it's great that this school finally comes out of the two offshoot campuses, both I think on 47th Street if I remember correctly, into a solid campus.

And I think it's great that Alderman Rodriguez and as well State Senator Tony Munoz were able to put the funds together to make this happen. I think the concerns that Alderman Dowell raised are the same ones that I was going to raise as well that where this campus is going was the epicenter for the black community in that area. As segregated as the city is, it was never any more segregated than right there.

Everything east, or excuse me, west of Cicero and north of 47th Street for the last 35 years has basically been solidly almost 99.9% African-American with maybe my grandfather and two others being the 0.2%. But if we're not ensuring that the opportunities that are coming out of the ashes of what used to be LeClaire Courts are not incorporating the black community, I have a problem with that. And I saw that you've reached out to the black contractors and some other groups. And yes, I do know that the surrounding area on the other side of the Vennum Park, Sleepy Hollow and Archer Heights neighborhoods are predominantly Latino.

And I'm very familiar with those neighborhoods. It's almost a slap in the face to say that we're working with everybody when the group that we displaced is not allowed to participate. And that bothers me.

It bothers me a lot because I remember the folks that live there. I remember the folks in the stores in Mrs. Sims that used to be on 45th and Cicero Avenue that I'd go after school sometimes to get our candy and stuff and try to ride the bike and get yelled at for crossing Cicero Avenue. I remember those stores.

I remember those people that live there and to not have the information or to not be able to tell us that our focus is on putting the people associated with that area to work gives me great pause. And I think that our questions about diversity, our questions about student enrollment and the questions that will be undoubtedly about who is actually having access to the jobs of building this. I think that, I'm all for moving forward but I think these questions should have been ready for today knowing damn well that we always ask these questions and more importantly the location where we're doing it.

And I for one chairman have no problem saying yes so that we can move forward but I think that before this gets reported out there better be some answers. And if the answers don't come by tomorrow then I would ask that if you are intent on moving forward with this today as a vote that you don't report it out tomorrow until the city council has the opportunity to review all of this because I'd hate to vote against this but I think there's still probably plenty of room for opportunity to address everything that I just brought up.

[Speaker 18] (5:05:37 - 5:05:39)
Alderman, oh, go ahead.

[Speaker 7] (5:05:39 - 5:05:40)
No, please.

[Speaker 18] (5:05:41 - 5:05:41)
Go ahead, Erin.

[Speaker 7] (5:05:42 - 5:08:38)
Thank you for your comments, Alderman and certainly the same to Alderman Dowell. And what I wanted to make sure I articulated was the absolute respect and partnership that we've come to enjoy with the right to return citizens and Alderman Rodriguez can speak to it in a little bit more detail but we've had dozens of meetings that culminated in a memorandum of understanding that guarantees hiring opportunities both in construction and long-term with the Hearst and LeClaire community organizations.

Specifically, this is not with the greater Vidham Parker Sleepy Hollow. It's a pointed memorandum of understanding specific to job opportunities, hiring, training, partnership and even more so the right to return constituency has been absolutely lovely and offered partnership and we've offered utilization of facilities. There's been numerous meetings to address that and forgive me if we failed to do a better job of explaining the MOU.

I was being respectful of the numerous chastisements that Chairman Tunney had given to prior speakers. So perhaps I went too quickly through those four elements that bind our agreement and bind our construction. There will be numerous opportunities for hiring to Alderman Dowell's question about board composition.

That is something we're not prepared to speak about and how that can evolve over time. But I can assure you being in numerous meetings with the school, the educators, the people on staff are highly diverse. As Amy mentioned, both lead educators, upper school principal and lower school principal are both Latin X women but there are numerous African.

In fact, if you look at the PowerPoint deck, you can see one of our favorite African American teachers that's on staff. So the staff is highly diverse. We'll get you the exact number of that but the board leadership is something that unfortunately neither Amy nor I can speak to directly.

I can absolutely assure you that the diversity of the people employed through construction will be paramount. This is something that is a condition of the state grant agreement, the executive order, the memorandum of understanding, as well as the CBA. We have four binding agreements that dictate not only our aspirational goals but our reporting on regular cycles.

In fact, so much so that we cannot receive the state grant funding without compliance. It's not aspirational. It is a all or nothing type of a funding mechanism.

And so I do apologize for failing to spend enough time on this but it is something that is imbued in every aspect of how we plan to proceed with this project.

[Speaker 4] (5:08:43 - 5:08:47)
I'm sorry, chairman. I didn't know if Amy was going to add to that or if they're both answering the same question.

[Speaker 18] (5:08:48 - 5:09:39)
Aaron, sorry, Amy Degnan with Daily and George's. Aaron did a great job of answering covered most of what I was gonna say. We will provide those breakdowns by the end of the day for staff as well as students.

And I don't know if Alderman Rodriguez wanted to add anything. I just wanted to reiterate what Aaron said. We had bi-weekly meetings at one point with former LeClaire Courts representative to draft and work through that MOU.

So the communication had been extensive through this whole process and it was led by Alderman Michael Rodriguez. And he did, we, as Aaron said, have four now binding contracts that require diversity and outreach throughout this construction process. And as well as the school, as it becomes a great neighbor of the neighborhood.

[Speaker 7] (5:09:40 - 5:10:08)
I also failed to mention that I used to serve as the chair of the public building commission for nearly a decade and stand on my record of more than 40% participation. Again, as a floor, not a ceiling, we're striving to achieve well over and above that. We believe very strongly.

We are individual advocates as well as this client being an advocate of diversity inclusion in the workforce and in the participation of the investment in this community.

[Speaker 1] (5:10:10 - 5:10:16)
All right. I've got a few more of my colleagues. Thank you Chairman.

Thank you, Alderman. Alderman David Moore.

[Speaker 15] (5:10:17 - 5:12:39)
Thank you. I'm gonna be late at a point because I could swear that Alderman Lopez is sitting at my desk looking at my notes. Anytime that I deal with anything from CHA, I'm always looking because working there and seeing what happened there and displacement and people wanting the right return, anything that go up there for me, it's very important.

But what's holding me up because it's more of a, I hope it's not a one man's crusade, but it's something that I'm looking at, especially after COVID, after the looting and everything like that, even closer. And that's to what Alderman Dow brought up in terms of what boards look like. And until we start challenging and forcing people to have their companies reflective of what this city, if what we thought we saw a couple of weeks ago is not going to happen again, it's going to be worse.

And when people say, I can't wait till we get back to normal. I always say, I don't want to go back because that wasn't normal. Us begging for contracts, us constantly asking people to have their boards representative of what our city is.

And especially on a land that Alderman Lopez articulated so well that housed so many African-Americans and but for the demolition of that would still be there. And so with hopes of returning and then yet nothing is built. And then when something gets built, it's not with 100% full complete participation.

So right now, I'm going to be a no on this as of today. If somebody can give some information about who the contractors are on this project and everything, that'd be helpful for me as well. That may help me change my mind.

But it may not if that, if I can't get a good answer about what this company is doing in terms of their board, because people are reflective of what they do, not what they say they're going to do. So I just wanted to add that in. So thank you.

Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (5:12:41 - 5:12:53)
Amy, do you want to respond to that? Are you giving us information so that if we do? I can speak to the contractor piece, if I may.

Yeah. Erin, start with you then.

[Speaker 7] (5:12:53 - 5:13:51)
Because this is the Rebuild Illinois Grant Foundation, this will be heavily minority. I also just looked through my notes in terms of staffing, so I'll address that first. The staffing is majority and minority staffing in my notes.

We will get that ethnic breakdown both by student population as well as staffing, but certainly appreciate, Alderman, more of the emphasis on the board participation itself. As it relates to general contracting, we have not yet selected. It's premature to in the phase of the project we're in to have selected our general contractor fully yet.

We're working through that process through a procurement. We have not signed a guaranteed maximum price with any contractor yet at this point. That is part of the outreach will be required to develop and what we've begun with all the assist agencies with the state, et cetera.

[Speaker 15] (5:13:53 - 5:13:54)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (5:14:00 - 5:14:01)
Aaron covered it.

[Speaker 18] (5:14:01 - 5:14:01)
OK.

[Speaker 1] (5:14:03 - 5:14:32)
All right. Alderman Gil Villegas, please. Chairman, I've lowered my hand.

I apologize. OK. All righty.

So I'm going to ask for. I don't see any more raised hands. Do I get a motion to pass on this item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 15] (5:14:33 - 5:14:39)
Motion to pass with the exception of David Moore voting. OK, well, let me let me get that motion was by.

[Speaker 1] (5:14:41 - 5:14:58)
Alderman Ciccio. OK, great. All right.

So Alderman Ciccio, Lopez moves to pass. We have an objection from Alderman David Moore and Alderman Dowell. Any other objections?

[Speaker 4] (5:15:00 - 5:15:03)
The other Lopez. The original.

[Speaker 1] (5:15:04 - 5:15:41)
All right. All right. So let me say.

The record will reflect the three noes. And with that, can I get the motion was made to pass. So it'll be passed as amend as it'll be passed with the idea that the objections were noted by Alderman Dowell, Alderman Moore and Alderman the original Raymond Lopez.

All right. Thank you very much. The item is passed.

[Speaker 7] (5:15:41 - 5:15:43)
All right. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (5:15:44 - 5:16:26)
Now we're going to the bottom of page 10. And I believe this is our last private application. Item number 20405, 27th Ward.

The ordinance was referred on May 20th of 2020. The common address is 171 through 185 North Halsted Street. 729 through 741 West Lake Street.

And 728 through 740 West Couch Place. The change request plan development number 1252 to plan development number 1252 as amended. Greg Steadman.

Mr. Chairman, can you hear me? I can hear you, Greg.

[Speaker 24] (5:16:26 - 5:16:49)
Very good. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record.

My name is Gregory Steadman. I'm the attorney on behalf of the applicant 733 West Lake Street Incorporated. As a plenary matter, this matter was before the Chicago Planning Commission on June 18th.

And I'd ask that the records of the Chicago Planning Commission be incorporated and entered into the record of these proceedings.

[Speaker 1] (5:16:52 - 5:17:05)
Alderman Cardona moves to incorporate the records from the Planning Commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none.

The records are incorporated. Greg, you can continue.

[Speaker 24] (5:17:06 - 5:20:15)
Thank you. The ordinance before the committee seeks to technically amend planned development number 1252. Planned development 1252 contains the Parker Fulton Market apartment building.

It is the only building located in planned development 1252. The Parker Fulton Market apartment building is generally located at 730 West Couch Place in the West Loop and Central Planning region of the city of Chicago. It is owned by Parker owner LLC, which is a joint venture between Chase Bank and Atlantic Residential.

Atlantic Residential manages the building. The applicant 733 West Lake Street Incorporated is a proposed packaged goods liquor business owned by Mr. Nick Patel. Mr. Patel has signed a lease with the Parker to open a liquor store on the north side of the building at 737 West Lake Street. Prior to signing the lease, Mr. Patel met with Alderman Burnett, who agreed to lift the packaged goods liquor moratorium on Lake Street. Mr. Patel could obtain the support of the local police district and West Loop Community Association. After meeting with Mr. Patel, the local police district and West Loop Community Association expressed their support for the store under the condition that Mr. Patel would agree to operate under a plan of operation. West Loop Community Association subsequently sent a letter of support to Alderman Burnett, which detailed the conditions of the plan of operation. After receiving the letter from West Loop, Alderman Burnett submitted an ordinance to lift the packaged goods moratorium on West Lake Street. The ordinance passed licensed committee on March 11th, 2020 and passed city council on April 24th, 2020.

Plan development 1252 was originally passed by the city council in September of 2014. At that time, the building was owned by 171 Partners, LLC. In November of 2014, the owner's representative DLA Piper requested and was granted an administrative adjustment to reduce the number of required street parking spaces from 159 to 137.

And in 2017, the building was sold to the current owner's Parker Owner, LLC. Plan development 1252 contains language in paragraph five, detailing permitted uses within the plan development. The language in the plan development reads that food and beverage retail sales are permitted, provided that liquor sales shall only be accessory use.

The applicant is now seeking to amend the existing plan development by deleting the accessory use liquor sale language in order to establish a liquor store within one of the grade level spaces on Lake Street within the existing building. The plan development will also be amended to reflect the new ownership of the building by Parker Owner, LLC and to reflect the 2014 administrative adjustment granted by the city reducing the required minimum off street parking spaces from 159 to 137. I respectfully ask this committee for your favorable consideration and vote for this ordinance and I'd be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 25] (5:20:15 - 5:20:16)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (5:20:21 - 5:20:29)
All right. I believe this is Walter. Walter.

Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 11] (5:20:30 - 5:20:54)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. As the councilor said, they met with me. They also met with the local police and they also met with the local community organization.

The community see no problem with lifting the moratorium here to allow for the liquor store to be open. It's unfortunate that we had to do a zoning change in order for this to happen. I support of it and I ask for this committee support also.

[Speaker 1] (5:20:55 - 5:21:02)
Thank you. Questions for the Alderman or the applicant?

[Speaker 15] (5:21:05 - 5:21:06)
No questions, so moved.

[Speaker 1] (5:21:07 - 5:21:12)
All right. So no more questions. I think that was Alderman David Moore.

[Speaker 71] (5:21:13 - 5:21:13)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (5:21:15 - 5:21:25)
Who was due to pass on the item by the same roll call that was used to determine the quorum. Was that enough in there?

[Speaker 15] (5:21:25 - 5:21:27)
Not my dog.

[Speaker 1] (5:21:28 - 5:22:23)
All right. Hearing no objections, the item is passed as revised. All right.

Thank you. Okay. Now, thank you for all your patience.

I'm going to now. Lastly, we will have a direct introduction to the committee, a proposed ordinance, tolling code section 2-120-705 to permit further consideration of a proposed Pilsen landmark district. I'm going to ask our commissioner, Maurice Cox, to explain the direct introduction and then we'll proceed with questions from the committee.

Chairman, this is Alderman Sitio Lopez.

[Speaker 3] (5:22:23 - 5:22:38)
I just want to make sure that we, you know, I want to put forward a motion to lay this issue on the table and also want to understand, you know, how this process came about. And also, you know, I barely got notice of this. So I want to understand exactly what's going on.

[Speaker 1] (5:22:43 - 5:24:06)
That's what we're going to do. I'm going to ask Commissioner Cox to explain the ordinance and some of the work. If there is a request of the committee, whether it be Alderman Lopez or others, to lay it on the table, I just really want our committee members to know that this tolling ordinance extends for a six month period for the Alderman, City Departments, and the community to hear out what is being presented by the Department of Planning.

And so I... Point of information, Chairman. Alderman Lopez, I'm not finished yet.

Okay. So what I'm saying is, to the committee members, we basically have two options here. We have the landmark recommendation that will expire in August if there is not passage of this tolling ordinance.

So it is really an effort to help you, Alderman Lopez, to help the community. Because if we decide to either lay it on the table or reject it, the landmark recommendation will become law. And that...

[Speaker 3] (5:24:06 - 5:24:07)
Point of information. That is not a help.

[Speaker 1] (5:24:08 - 5:24:14)
I'm not finished yet. That's not a help to you or your community. Now, Alderman Sitio Lopez.

[Speaker 3] (5:24:16 - 5:24:51)
Yeah, I just want to make sure, you know, that we get this very clear. So this landmark, because I think it's important, the point of information, there's really some real traveling assumptions that are here. And I think that they're boxing us, they're boxing my community in, you know, this dichotomy and options that were unfortunately created.

So I just want to lay it out for point of information before the commissioner starts, because it is important that we are given the opportunity as an elected representative. And I'm glad that my colleagues had the opportunity to... Wait, okay.

But Alderman Sitio Lopez... I want to just... I want to make sure...

[Speaker 1] (5:24:51 - 5:25:19)
Chairman, I was given the... Okay, but Alderman Lopez, you have to... This is the mayor's ordinance.

So we're going to hear from the department and then you will be able to rebut and respond and criticize and do whatever. This is a direct introduction from the mayor. And I'm going to ask the commissioner to speak.

There'll be plenty of rebuttal by the committee members and yourself. So with that, I'm going to ask Commissioner Cox to begin.

[Speaker 2] (5:25:20 - 5:25:54)
Thank you, Commissioner Tunney and to members of the board. I have three slides that I've asked be projected as while I review this, if they can be brought up. And I look forward to a robust conversation upon the conclusion of these brief remarks.

So if whomever is controlling the slides can put them up, that would be welcome. Thank you.

[Speaker 18] (5:25:54 - 5:25:59)
Yep. Just give me one second. I'm looking forward on my...

It's not popping up.

[Speaker 2] (5:26:16 - 5:26:20)
Is it going to happen? Should I just begin speaking?

[Speaker 18] (5:26:20 - 5:26:26)
It will. I'm sorry. It's not...

There we go. It wasn't popping up on my options to share. Okay.

Excellent.

[Speaker 2] (5:26:27 - 5:44:44)
All right. So thank you very much. So members of the committee, thank you.

Just for the record, I'm Maurice Cox, the Commissioner for the Department of Planning and Development. So the request before you is the approval of the proposed ordinance tolling section 2-120-705 of the municipal code to permit further consideration of the proposed Pilsen Historic District as a Chicago landmark. So before I go over the reasons for that request, let me re-familiarize you with the proposed district boundaries.

So on May 16th, 2019, the Commission on Chicago Landmarks adopted a resolution recommending that the Pilsen Historic District be designated a Chicago landmark. The Commission determined that the Pilsen Historic District, predominantly located on West 18th Street between South Levitt and South Sagamon Streets and 13 blocks bounded by West 18th Street on the north, South Ashland Avenue on the west and West 21st Street to the south and South Racine Avenue to the east. It satisfied at least four criteria for landmark designation.

The Commission filed the recommendation with the City Council on May 16th, 2019. Pursuant on the section 2-120-705 of the municipal code, and I quote, if the City Council does not take final action upon any landmark recommendation submitted by the Commission on Chicago Landmarks to the City Council within 365 days of the date upon the recommendation is filed with the City Council, landmark designation based upon the recommendation of the Commission shall be granted, end quote. The 365 day period was told from March 17th, 2020 through June 30th, 2020 pursuant to Article 2, Section 2 of the ordinance adopted by City Council on April 24th, 2020. And so the 365 day deadline for the City Council to take final action regarding the designation on the Pilsen Historic District will now expire on August 28th, 2020.

So the ordinance in front of you today is to toll the 365 day period again until no later than January 31st, 2021. Without the passage of the ordinance before you today, the original landmark ordinance will take effect on August 29th, 2020. So community engagement has occurred throughout the landmark designation process.

And I think it's really, really important to underscore for the benefit of those of us who were not here, how this has been socialized and how by approving this tolling ordinance, we will allow further public consideration of the recommendation to designate the Pilsen Historic District. So here's the timeline as I have understood it. On December 6th, 2018, the Commission on Chicago Landmarks approved preliminary landmark recommendations in its public hearing.

There were public comments in that public hearing. There were eight speakers. Seven of the speakers spoke in favor of the district.

One opposed. On December 31st, 2018, a letter was sent to all of the owners in the district. 889 properties were notified about this preliminary recommendation.

On January 10th, 2019, the Commission on Chicago Landmarks approved the DPD report at its public meeting. There were public comments at that meeting as well. In this meeting, six people spoke.

Two spoke in favor and four spoke unopposed. In February 7th, 2019, the Landmarks Commission adopted the preliminary summary of information report at its public meeting. Once again, public comment was solicited.

Four individuals testified. All four testified in favor of the landmark district. So in March 7th, 2019, the Landmarks Commission issued a preliminary disapproval of a demolition application that was submitted on 1734 West 18th Street at its public meeting.

They were able to disapprove the demolition because of this pending district consideration. March 26th of 2019, letters were sent out to owners. All 889 properties were notified.

The letters went out in English and in Spanish. So that we would be disapproving of the demolition application and triggered an expedited consideration on both the proposed designation and the demo application and notified them again of a community public hearing that would happen on April 16th. At that same time, the planning department launched an informational website in both Spanish and in English on the historic district.

And that website remains open today where people can find extensive information about the historic designation proposal. So at the point of April 3rd, April 3rd, 2019, the planning department staff met with representatives of the Pilsen Alliance. On April 11th, 2019, the planning department staff met with representatives of the United Merchants of Pilsen.

On April 12th, 2019, the planning department staff met with representatives of several Pilsen community organizations, including the Resurrection Project, the 18th Street Development Corporation, Alvivo Medical Center and the Pilsen Neighbors Community Council. On April 16th, 2019, the planning department convened a community meeting in Lozano Library in Pilsen. And it was attended by over 140 people.

And in fact, I was told that the Alderman, Sitio Lopez, then an Alderman-elect, attended this meeting. April 24th, 2019, a public hearing on the district was attended by 27 property owners, community residents and members of the general public and Alderman-elect Sitio Lopez. Statements made by 22 individuals, which included property owners, business owners and members of the general public, spoke directly about the district.

Apologies. And so that was a very robust process of engagement. All voices were heard.

And the district itself, the benefits and the responsibilities of the district were covered. On May 16th, 2019, the final landmark recommendation to city council was forwarded. Public comments were given by nine individuals at that time.

Four spoke out against and five spoke in favor. So June 17th, 2019, the planning department staff attended a community roundtable meeting. This specifically was to create a more intimate, smaller group setting.

And this was the beginning of our partnership with Alderman Sitio Lopez. It was organized by his office and 15 people attended the meeting. June 19th, 2019, the planning department staff attended another community roundtable, once again, organized by Alderman Sitio Lopez's office, specifically geared to smaller groups.

July 8th, 2019, community open house was organized with the Alderman's office. For the planning staff to have office hours to answer questions one-on-one to residents. On July 11th, 2019, the planning department participated in a community meeting organized by the Alderman Sitio Lopez, where approximately 150 people attended the meeting.

And so, you know, to characterize this as anything other than a robust attempt to inform and educate the residents of Pilsen, I think would be a mischaracterization. Now I will tell you, I joined this effort in the fall of 2019. And on November 1st, I spent three hours driving the streets of Pilsen and Little Village with Alderman Sitio Lopez.

And we talked extensively about the benefits of a historic district and how he had the opportunity to do something that has not been done with a historic district before in Chicago. And that is to make it work for the folks who are there. And so I committed to him then to bring every tool at my disposal to make sure that this district was truly a unique district that empowered residents.

So I made that commitment. In March 6th, 2020, myself and members from the mayor's office met in the Alderman's office there were 12 to 15 community groups there. We committed to working with them to design a unique historic district tailored to the needs of Pilsen.

That was in March. And I will tell you, that's when the coronavirus hit. And frankly, it challenged us to hold the public's attention in the face of that crisis.

So my staff and I, we went into a deep research to understand what tools we could bring forward that would make this district address the issues that I have been hearing. I have personally called a number of community leaders. I'm certainly not finished, but I am committed to hearing from them all.

And they have been schooling me as to the perceptions, misperceptions about historic districts and how this needs to be different. I held those conversations with the CEO of the Instituto del Progreso Latino, with Mario Perez, and as well with Raul Raimondo. And so those were my last efforts in an effort to continue the process of engagement.

I need more time to fully engage. So that is why I am asking for this six month extension. So if you go to my last slide, and I'm wrapping up.

So, you know, Pilsen has been preserved, protected, and enriched by the Latino community since they first settled in this neighborhood over 60 years ago. I mean, century old housing has been rehabbed by those same families. The stores on 18th Street were opened by Latino small business owners, and they've continued to serve this community.

The churches in the neighborhood have remained vibrant. The schools are full of children who are building their childhood memories on the physical character of Pilsen. The walls have been enriched with colorful murals celebrating the Latino culture.

This is the level of stewardship and community engagement that has preserved Pilsen thus far as one of Chicago's most vibrant historic areas. This designation represents two important firsts for the city's landmark program. It's the first that recognizes the contributions and culture of Chicago's Latinx community.

And it's the first to incorporate the murals and architecture as a layered historic resource. The landmark designation is the city's effort to act on the physical environment to protect the cultural and social environment. Every commercial building on 18th Street that is demolished is a loss of a Latino small business owner.

Every single family house that's demolished is a loss of families who shop locally and whose kids attend neighborhood schools. As we lose the physical fabric of Pilsen, we lose the community of Pilsen. So the landmark designation would slow down the demolitions that we've observed over the past 12 years.

Over 90 structures have been lost. We will hit the pause button and have a community conversation and talk about the impacts of any demolition that's proposed. The buildings such as the ones you see illustrated in this slide would otherwise be lost.

And these families and these businesses would be dispersed to make way for a newer structure and newer residents. And we simply believe that that should not happen. And DPD will continue to engage the community regarding possible solutions that the city can provide.

And there are many that we can provide to address the issues that residents and communities have brought up regarding Pilsen. So on behalf of the Department of Planning and Development, I recommend approval of the proposed ordinance tolling section 2-120-705 of the municipal code to permit further consideration of the proposed Pilsen Historic District as a Chicago landmark. Thank you, Chairman Tony.

[Speaker 1] (5:44:45 - 5:45:19)
Thank you, Commissioner. And I know while you're relatively new to Chicago, it seems to me that you've been totally engaged in the 25th Ward trying to educate and move this landmark ordinance. And again, I want to tell the committee members that what we're doing is giving more time for all sides to be heard.

And also, I do believe, Commissioner, that you had offered some very unique incentives to this district. I don't know if you're prepared to speak on them.

[Speaker 2] (5:45:20 - 5:49:33)
I absolutely am because they are a product, quite frankly, of a robust set of conversations that I have had with the aldermen and community members. So for example, Chicago has never used the Adopt-a-Landmark Fund to go towards the typical mercantile buildings that you find on 18th Street. They have tended to go toward the more iconic neighborhood buildings like churches.

So I have been working with my staff to set up a fund, an Adopt-a-Landmark Fund for Pilsen commercial corridor, and we would put a million dollars a year annually for three years that are available to the local long-term property owners. These would be grants up to $50,000. It would go for a rehab, for exterior facade improvements.

It's a way that those who own the properties on 18th Street can invest in their property and not have to sell. This is a first. We haven't done this for any historic district in the city.

In addition, we are looking at guidelines. We have committed $70,000 to create Pilsen-specific guidelines so that the guidelines that govern other historic districts will not be a burden to residents and property owners in the Pilsen district. We want to make sure that they know how to maximize the potential of their property while they, at the same time, preserve their property.

I also believe that the murals which populate Pilsen, which are a part of the Latino culture, should be preserved. We've set aside $30,000 to do that historic preservation scan and set of suggestions for how to preserve them. A lot of people have talked about housing and the fact that there needs to be a greater homeowner assistance effort in Pilsen and Little Village as a whole.

I have been working with my partner, Commissioner Navarro, to come up with a first-of-its-kind, multimillion-dollar homeowner assistance fund that we would be able to start at the beginning of the adoption of this ordinance. I'm committed to tailoring that so that it meets the needs of residents who are there. I could go on.

A big issue that Alderman Siccio-Lopez raised was the idea of local control. I agree that the decisions that are made about the future of Pilsen, every project that is proposed for demolition should come before a locally controlled commission. So I have done extensive research to understand this, how it would play out in Chicago, and I'm prepared to design that with community members so that Pilsen has local control.

And so for every issue that may be an unintended consequence of this district, I have tried to bring this forward in the spirit of partnership and so I want to continue to do this work. Obviously, I believe in the district. I believe that we can do something that has never been done before in Chicago.

I simply want the opportunity to engage people to that end.

[Speaker 1] (5:49:34 - 5:49:37)
And that's why you support the direct introduction.

[Speaker 2] (5:49:38 - 5:49:57)
That is exactly why, because I need six months to work with those community groups that have reached out to me and said they are willing to work with me. And I will stop there because I see that Alderman would like to engage.

[Speaker 1] (5:49:57 - 5:50:04)
We have a number of questions. If you're going to ask, I don't see Alderman Siccio-Lopez's hand raised.

[Speaker 3] (5:50:05 - 5:50:08)
Chairman, I mean, can I cut a little of the rebuttal?

[Speaker 1] (5:50:11 - 5:50:28)
Yes, that's not where I was going. You did not raise your hand, but I know it's your ward. So I'm going to call on you to rebut or comment on the extension of the tolling period for the Landmark District.

Alderman Siccio-Lopez.

[Speaker 3] (5:50:31 - 5:59:52)
Thank you. First of all, let me thank you, Chairman, for allowing my constituents to have a voice today. And I think that it is very clear that the administration was much better prepared for today than me.

Obviously, we did not have the opportunity to even discuss in a direct introduction that affects our constituents first. So I hear Commissioner Cox. I'm not putting in question the briefings that he's received, but I can tell you with authority that I was there in a lot of those meetings.

And let me make sure that I get some of the factual information first. This landmark, first of all, was conceived not by the community, not in a quality of life plan, not in any community process. This was conceived in the absence of or during the unfortunate situation that happened by my predecessor.

So there were conversations that were rushed. So a lot of the meetings that you allude to in April, and Commissioner, if you're not aware of, coincide with the time that my predecessor was not even in office and coincide with a period that seemed to be rushed. Commissioner Gorski, the previous administration, Alderman Solis did not consult with the community.

I think that you rightly state that on April 2019, there were 222 testimonies in the first public meeting that was hosted. Commissioner Cox, I was there. I can tell you with authority, and I think that's what is not included in your testimony, that 22 residents spoke against the proposal.

And I think that's very important to allude because as you heard today, once again, nine out of the nine testimonies, even though we were not prepared for this meeting, were against the landmark. And let me tell you why people elected a different choice than my predecessor. So let me make sure that we are factual here because it was important that we have a process.

So you have asked for time. I think before you, there was also another commissioner that asked for time. What I think is very clear here is that when the outcome doesn't satisfy the administration, we continue to jump hoops despite the opposition of the community.

I think that when we saw the opposition the first time that there was this process that started wrong is when my community in that meeting that you rightly so point out on April 2019, rightly so said, do not introduce this because people understood that it was an all or nothing deal. That did not matter. And rightly so on May, as you pointed out, on May 16th, four days before I took office, Commissioner Gorski introduced a direct introduction similar to the one that you want to extend without consultation, without talking to the community and put it as an equitable predicament because now we have to decide on all or nothing kind of deals, which is an incorrect and inadequate way to do community processes. Now, despite of that, we agree that we're going to take our time for doing one year.

I think that you rightly so discussed that my community and I think you point out the multiple meetings that my community have hosted from focus groups, public meetings. I think I want to correct some inaccuracies if you allow me. Some of the inaccuracies that you have in one of the meetings in July, there were over 400 attendees and the focus groups, we have had at least 15 per session.

I have taken my time and trusted the Department of Planning's judgment so that we can have a real process. We decided that within one year, we are going to respect the outcome of such a process. We have discussed, this is indeed one of the largest landmarks, not only here in the state, but probably in the country.

And you are experimenting with a community that's already struggling with taxes. There's already struggling with rehab. I tell you, let's discuss a little bit of the incentives because it's important that my colleagues learn a little bit about incentives and why some of the testimonies clearly stated that this is not supporting the small businesses or the long-term residents, but indeed this supports the investors and speculators that are continuing to destroy my community and that's what my predecessor allowed this to move forward. Now, I was fair.

I said, let's discuss this. If it's a tool that will help my community, of course, I'm gonna consider. Commissioner Cox, if you have had an opportunity to talk to me, I've been not only in these meetings on the last year, but at least for 10 years discussing this very same issue.

Never once the landmark became a tool in our community, even the quality of life plan done by the Great Cities Institute does not include it. And I tell you why. The reason why this is not a good tool for our community is because when you talk about the million dollars for the 800 plus buildings that you wanna, now you want a landmark.

I tell you, and I think that some research shows that between 50,000 to 65,000 will be the minimum that a household will need in order to keep up with the already hard codes that our city has. Now, if you add a landmark, it will be even more costly. Now, we have a million dollars per year, as you rightly alluded to.

If you, let's do the math, right? For how many buildings do we have that opportunity to contribute, right? How many families can we help with that million dollars a year?

If we do the math, perhaps between 15 to 20 households. And I have said that I am open to have that kind of conversation. But if you really wanna do a math correctly, we're talking about, and I think your department knows this very well, that we will need a significant amount, maybe $50 million to do the kind of landmarking that you're proposing, Commissioner Cox.

So again, we wanna make sure, and that's what the testimonies have said. Look, one another thing that you wanna add to that, a lot of these incentives, and why developers love this idea, is because increase the assessment value over properties of already struggling homeowners. So the taxes will go up.

And on top of that, that you will need to have to qualify for these incentives, including the tax breaks, and including some of these $50,000 that you rightly point out. You will list 25% of the assessment of the property to qualify. Now, one of the things that I think is important to really clarify here, is that all communities, Commissioner Cox, right now do not have the liquidity, and do not have the, especially now, I think you rightly saw from one homeowner that said right now, it probably is the worst time to do this kind of landmarking, to put extra products into a community that is already struggling.

So when you talk about, and also we have Professor Betancourt, that also have done some national studies about the effects of landmarking on the most vulnerable. Now, I agree with you, Commissioner Cox, in the need of doing the, that we do indeed need to address some issues like demolitions. However, you know, the unintended consequences that you mentioned are dire.

I give you an example, and I think that's what is very important that we have rooted, and in the grassroots level, perhaps some things that you may not be seeing as the unintended consequences. Right now, we have seniors, low-income residents that come to our home, and they're asked that they need to do repairs. A lot of my colleagues don't know this, but the minute that this went into effect, and that's why it wasn't consulted with me to begin with.

But however, because I do believe in the spirit of democracy and the spirit of looking at every single tool, I said, let's have the process to discuss. What I didn't know is that this, and I think, correct me if I'm wrong, Commissioner, what I didn't know is that this already takes into effect. So already we have homeowners and people in my community that given this direct introduction, that is perceived to be this benign thing that maybe is not causing much troubles, what it does, it now forces a lot of my homeowners, like you heard in the testimonies, a small business that had to spend extra money in earnings.

Commissioner Cox, I was there, and the testimony is real. Now, we have also homeowners that are have right now to go in front of planning commission. Imagine what it is for a low-income family to have to hire an architect to justify the repairs so that they can be up to code.

Now, again, we're talking about a very expensive experiment that we want to propose. Now, let's look at the process, Commissioner Cox, because I think that's what's also missing in your presentation. Let's look at the outcome of the year-long process, right?

And the reason why you have not had the courtesy to let me know about your decision of asking for six months, because you know very well about the outcome of the surveys that we conducted with your team in my office, multiple focus groups, multiple community groups, and you just heard from directly testimonies that I was able to gather within 24 hours. I think I can get you many more, but I think that the one thing that is very important to mention is that in the district, with homeowners in the district, and I send you an email with that, Commissioner Cox, there are approximately 200, please, my colleagues, please listen to this figure, 235 affidavits were collected, sealed and signed by homeowners in my district that oppose in 95% the proposal.

[Speaker 2] (5:59:52 - 5:59:54)
How many properties are there in the historic district?

[Speaker 3] (5:59:54 - 6:04:14)
Commissioner, I did not have the opportunity to ask you a question, so I appreciate the courtesy. So I think that the thing is that we need to look at the outcome of those public meetings. And the reason why my office did not have the same courtesy as you all had, that when there's a direct introduction, of course, it's common courtesy that we let the aldermen know, we let the community groups know.

Not three community groups, not three phone calls. We gotta talk about a robust community process as you have rightly so said, Commissioner Cox, a robust community process. It is the kind of process that I conducted and do with due diligence, with community groups, like you mentioned, with testimonies, as I provided, with affidavits, as we agreed on.

Now, if the outcome, Commissioner Cox, is not satisfactory, you know, to the DPD, right? And it's not what your department is willing to consider, right? We do have a democratic process because that's what we are elected.

We are elected to listen, not to educate, to listen to my constituents, my small businesses, my homeowners. I do need to listen to see what is best for them. Now, what I tell you that is more troubling, right?

And this is what it gets really complicated. That what are you trying to do, Commissioner? It is not that we did not want to have a conversation.

The minute that the outcome wasn't satisfactory, the conversations stopped. Not because we wanted to, but because it was very obvious that the department wanted to go in a much different direction. But I tell you that using the emergency powers ordinance that is already expired by the end of June, to try to put a direct introduction that bypasses my office.

By the way, my predecessor put that on under, you know, the conversation with DPD, direct introduction. So it is my, my duty and my own, I'm the only one right now that can put a direct ordinance in place. So right now, of course, that you can do this preliminary maneuvering, you can do many things that unfortunately is very clear that I did not even allow me to talk to my colleagues before taking this vote and try to surprise me last minute.

But I tell you, fortunately, I have been doing this work for a while and I know the facts of being there in those committee meetings. I know the feeling of my homeowners who are being struggling. I know those who need to do repairs and now they have developers who are going after them and saying, well, if you cannot do the repairs, we can buy your property.

That's what this is about, Commissioner Cox. So let me talk about the reason why this is important, because we were very clear that within the 365 days, you know, we were going to make a decision. Now, this is the third time that my community is let down.

The third time. The first time when we said, do not introduce something without a consent. It was introduced.

Let's do it. You know, within the year that we decided to have a public meetings and the process that you rightly described, Commissioner Cox. I was there.

I listened very carefully about, you know, my constituents. I will deal with the consequences of it. The consequences are going to be dealt by my administration, not by you, Commissioner Cox.

They will be dealt by my community. So I know it's easy to experiment. But for me, this is my home.

This is the people that I represent. These are the neighbors that I talk to and I serve. So again, it is very troubling to see an emergency power ordinance that is expired and a direct introduction without consultation, not only with me, but with my stakeholders, right?

Again, and in the third time, yet another third time, this has happened because the outcome wasn't satisfactory. My colleagues, I think that we set a very dangerous precedent if we allow this kind of, this kind of decision making when commissioners, you know, decide to do things on their own, perhaps with good intentions, but with unintended consequences that I hope explain to you in detail. I have explored as well as the representative that was elected.

I was elected to do this job. My predecessor, yes, had that idea as well, Commissioner Cox. And I think that my community decided otherwise.

They decided that there was a different route and a route that I also have shared with you, Commissioner Cox. Like I said, at least two months ago, the substitute that I'm proposing, and I'm going to propose again today, a substitute. And by the way, OK, here's what we're doing.

[Speaker 38] (6:04:14 - 6:04:15)
Here's what we're going to do.

[Speaker 1] (6:04:15 - 6:04:19)
There are no, no, no. There are other Alderman.

[Speaker 14] (6:04:20 - 6:05:03)
You're going to have the closing thought. We're going to move to Alderman Sawyer. Thank you, Chairman.

And good afternoon, everyone. I got on to ask some questions because my colleague, Byron Centro-Lopez called me at the last minute and expressed some concerns. I was not, in all honesty, that much aware of what was going on.

So I took a quick dive into it. And let me just get some clarity. And Commissioner Cox, I hope you can help me out.

And you helped me a lot with your presentation. The issue that we have up today is just tolling the expiration of the 365 days. Is that correct?

[Speaker 2] (6:05:03 - 6:05:04)
That is correct.

[Speaker 14] (6:05:04 - 6:05:06)
That's the only thing that's up today.

[Speaker 2] (6:05:06 - 6:05:07)
That's it.

[Speaker 14] (6:05:07 - 6:05:24)
If we do nothing today, the landmark would be in effect had unless Byron Centro-Lopez files something to terminate it or does something to stop the bleeding, so to speak.

[Speaker 2] (6:05:25 - 6:05:38)
If we do not toll and get the additional six months, the ordinance goes into effect on August 28th. Okay.

[Speaker 14] (6:05:38 - 6:05:43)
So something had to be done by somebody, whether it be you or someone else.

[Speaker 2] (6:05:43 - 6:05:46)
You better believe it. Okay.

[Speaker 14] (6:05:46 - 6:06:36)
So my concern is that, and I've had these conversations in the past with all my colleagues. If there's something that a colleague feels strongly about in their ward as relates to a zoning issue, I'm going to support that colleague come hell or high water. Whatever they decide they want to do for their ward, I think that I owe them that respect to get something done.

But today, all we're talking about is, sorry, my dog is keep hitting me. Only thing we're talking about today is extending this for six months so continued conversations can be had. Is it correct that Alderman Centro-Lopez can still do what he wants to do as it relates to fighting the landmark designation?

[Speaker 2] (6:06:40 - 6:06:49)
I don't know who that is addressed to. Well, whoever can answer it adequately. Repeat the question.

[Speaker 14] (6:06:50 - 6:07:05)
Is it correct that Alderman Centro-Lopez during this six month stay could file whatever he needs to file if he does not, or his constituents don't want the landmark designation, they can do whatever's necessary to oppose the landmark designation?

[Speaker 1] (6:07:06 - 6:07:08)
I believe that to be true.

[Speaker 14] (6:07:10 - 6:07:12)
Commissioner, would you agree?

[Speaker 2] (6:07:12 - 6:07:22)
I mean, we have Ray Philip Sancho from law in the call and he would like to address that question.

[Speaker 1] (6:07:24 - 6:07:30)
Okay. Ray, would you like to respond to Alderman Sawyer's request?

[Speaker 16] (6:07:31 - 6:07:36)
Can Alderman Sawyer repeat his question clearly again?

[Speaker 14] (6:07:36 - 6:08:01)
Certainly. My question is if Alderman, during this, if we agree to toll the landmark designation, during this- Up to six months. Up to six months.

Yes. During this period, will Alderman Centro-Lopez have an opportunity to oppose this proposed landmark designation?

[Speaker 25] (6:08:03 - 6:08:09)
Good afternoon, Ray Philip Sancho on behalf of the city of Chicago. Yes, the answer to your question, Alderman Sawyer is absolutely yes.

[Speaker 14] (6:08:10 - 6:08:37)
Okay. That's my, I mean, that's my overriding concern. I don't have the details as Commissioner Cox has or Alderman Centro-Lopez has, but I want to know that if my colleague is having a problem with whatever's going on in his ward, he's not, does not feel comfortable.

I would like to provide support for him in whatever he's trying to do. And that's my concern. And that's really- Alderman Sawyer, I think we're on the same page.

[Speaker 1] (6:08:38 - 6:10:16)
And, and because by not acting on this ordinance, tolling ordinance today, then as Commissioner Cox says, it goes into effect August 28th without any more community input. We don't want that to happen. We wouldn't want that for any of our colleagues.

Yes. So there's, there's a lot of statements between the department and the Alderman at the end of the day, that's a legislative process. We can act up to, from let's say September through January, and we could vote down the ordinance even after all this work has been done by the department.

So I, you know, I think what we're doing, and I think Alderman Centro-Lopez might disagree with me, but I think we're doing a cooling off period here so that we can as colleagues be able to understand that the Alderman's wishes and his community wishes are going to rule the legislative process. And for some of you and not me, this is a brand new issue up maybe into the last few days. I have been working with Sitio Lopez for many months, a few months on this issue.

Now, I think it's the right compromise that doesn't cede any power to the local Alderman over this issue. And what I think if we don't act prudently, I think his community is going to be shut out of any future discussion. And I don't think that's fair to us, any of us.

[Speaker 14] (6:10:16 - 6:10:32)
And that's my overriding concern. I want to make sure his neighbors, his constituents are heard and they have an opportunity to provide a voice in what goes forward. And I don't know the whole situation.

I only found out about it last night. So I'm just wanting to be supportive of my colleague. Thank you, Chair.

All right.

[Speaker 1] (6:10:33 - 6:10:35)
Alderman Ray Lopez.

[Speaker 16] (6:10:36 - 6:10:37)
I have a point of information.

[Speaker 1] (6:10:37 - 6:10:40)
All right, point of information for Alderman Pat Dowell.

[Speaker 16] (6:10:40 - 6:10:40)
Yeah.

[Speaker 1] (6:10:42 - 6:10:43)
Pat?

[Speaker 16] (6:10:43 - 6:10:59)
Yeah, just to be clear, the May 16, 2019 resolution was adopted by city council or just submitted to city council for adoption.

[Speaker 1] (6:11:00 - 6:11:35)
The recommendation was adopted by the Landmark Commission. It then get referred to the city clerk for us to consider as the Zoning Committee of Landmarks and Preservation. But we never considered it.

It has not been acted on for that period for the year. But then we had the COVID situation where it extended it a couple of more months. And this is why we're at that deadline for August 28th.

[Speaker 9] (6:11:37 - 6:11:39)
Chairman Alderman Rodriguez for a point of order.

[Speaker 1] (6:11:40 - 6:11:41)
Alderman Rodriguez.

[Speaker 9] (6:11:42 - 6:11:51)
I thought I heard earlier in the meeting Alderman Sitiko Lopez moved for consideration of a substitute ordinance. Is that going to be taken up?

[Speaker 1] (6:11:52 - 6:14:07)
I know the committee members have received the substitute ordinance and it's my assertion as the chairman that the substantive ordinance is substantially different than the tolling ordinance that we're asking. And just point blank that this ordinance that is a substitute would literally have a three or four year demolition hold, which I don't think, and I know we have law on there, that's substantially different than what we're discussing today. So I think it's out of order to accept the direct substitute because it has nothing to do with the tolling ordinance that's in front of it.

So if he wants, if Alderman Sitiko Lopez wants to introduce something on Wednesday, it's all, he can start this process as- Mr. Chair, wait a second. We talked to Chairman Sawyer about it, is that the Alderman, the local Alderman has the right to introduce something there. We also have the opportunity to hear prior to six months that the community is not interested in landmarking as they see it.

But again, this is a cooling off period, I believe, but it's also a period, and by the way, talk about due process, having this three to five year moratorium hold, we don't have, that's substantially different. We haven't noticed the city about it or the residents about it. So we can't do something that dramatically different, and I think it's substantially a different ordinance.

It's not a substitute. What I can say, as I said before, if Sitiko Lopez, the Alderman, would like to introduce something on Wednesday, he has all the power and ability to do that. But I think what we want to do is to help Sitiko Lopez in his community over the next, up to six months.

It could be- It could be- Okay. So- Chair, can I- You want to respond to that, Sitiko Lopez, specifically to that about the substitutes that you tried to put forth.

[Speaker 3] (6:14:09 - 6:14:13)
Yeah, Chairman, can I rebut about the substitute?

[Speaker 1] (6:14:14 - 6:14:15)
Yes, sir.

[Speaker 3] (6:14:16 - 6:15:55)
Yeah, so again, and I will challenge this notion again of the use of emergency power ordinance that is expired, I already have heard with some of my constituents that they're going to challenge that, and there's already homeowners who are going to challenge that because that is also a very big concern, huge concern. In fact, my substitute ordinance, again, that is using some of the language, and I think that we want to make sure that what we have, either way, they're going to make sure that they're underused or undermined. There will be challenges.

Of course, it's more ideal that we don't have to air this in public, but I'm within my right, I think that I can raise to move an amendment in the form of a substitute because that's under Rule 33 so that we can propose this under consideration and let us decide that on legal terms as we're going to have to decide on the emergency powers ordinance. I think that expiration date is going to be a big problem. So I'd like to know that, for the clerk, that every single one of my colleagues received a copy of the amendment with a specific section that was stroke and it's showing the relevant substitutions.

So it is using the language and it's a direct introduction that can strike the current landmark. And we want to make sure that we have a similar process. We're talking about the same thing.

What we want to make sure is that why do I have to wait in a direct introduction that I'm within my right to introduce, right? And I think there's a matter of legal opinions, but I think within my right to make that motion. So I'd like to put the motion on the floor for my colleagues to consider because they're both, all right.

[Speaker 1] (6:15:55 - 6:16:06)
You're dismissing, you're dismissing the fact that there was an emergency ordinance that was used. So in the opinion of chair, the substitute that you introduced is out of order. Now, who else had their point of information up there?

[Speaker 5] (6:16:07 - 6:17:02)
Alderman Riley. Alderman Riley. Well, chairman, you're absolutely correct.

This is a substantively different amendment than what was brought before us today. This is about invalidating a landmark district. It has nothing to do with extending a tolling period.

So I'd argue that chairman, you are absolutely correct in your interpretation and I'll support your motion. But, you know, I guess I'm really confused because our colleague, Alderman Citro Lopez is claiming deficiencies in the process. Adding this tolling agreement gives him more time to build whatever process he needs.

And so I guess I'm incredibly confused. If this fails today, there will be no tolling and the landmark district go into effect. So anyway, chairman, as a point of information, I believe you're, you are correct in your opinion.

[Speaker 3] (6:17:02 - 6:17:10)
All right. Chairman, can we have legal opinion? We have legal opinion.

I mean, we need a lawyer to look.

[Speaker 1] (6:17:10 - 6:17:11)
Oh, okay. This is.

[Speaker 3] (6:17:11 - 6:17:12)
I don't need a lawyer.

[Speaker 1] (6:17:13 - 6:17:25)
Hold on a second. I'm not a lawyer. And I, I'm, I don't know your credentials either, but we do have law on the, on the line.

So is legal counsel Ray?

[Speaker 25] (6:17:26 - 6:17:28)
I'm here chairman.

[Speaker 1] (6:17:29 - 6:17:46)
Yes. So do you want to restate quickly what your concern is for legal counsel? Alderman Citro Lopez, ask the question direct and let's get an answer.

[Speaker 3] (6:17:48 - 6:18:20)
Yeah. Again, all I'm asking is, this is just a legal opinion because I haven't gotten a written opinion. As of, you know, I think that we're on the same page in terms of that.

The substitute would not help us to make sure that this does not, because of course we agreement in agreement that nobody wants the landmark to be into effect. All I want is basically put, because I haven't gotten this in writing in a few months. So we like to get legal on public record.

Just if, if, if that doesn't do it, then, you know, um, you know, again, maybe this is a, this is a time where we, we can clarify the question.

[Speaker 1] (6:18:20 - 6:18:27)
Alderman Citro Lopez, just for the edification of the, of the lawyer and the Russ, what is the question?

[Speaker 3] (6:18:31 - 6:18:42)
So my question is if we kill the, or we vote these down, then my substitute doesn't, doesn't do the magic trick. Then the landmark goes into effect. Yes or no?

[Speaker 1] (6:18:43 - 6:18:46)
Okay. That's it. Can we hear from law, please?

[Speaker 25] (6:18:47 - 6:20:17)
Good afternoon. Ray Phillips Santos again for the city of Chicago. If the, um, substitute that, that, uh, that is proposed for this, um, were to be, uh, were to be accepted as a substitute.

Um, and, and I, and I think that, uh, chairman, you are correct. Um, it would be fair to rule it out of order as it is substantially different from what was introduced. But even if the substitute were accepted, then, um, a, I, I don't think that, uh, we'd be able to have a hearing on it and consideration of it as the, um, it was not on the agenda.

Uh, the people have not been able to attend this, uh, and, and to weigh in on this. Um, there, there, there'd be no public comment on it. Um, so arguably it, it would violate the open meetings act.

Um, but yes, the, the landmark designation would still go into effect on August 28th, 2020. Um, and, uh, so this, uh, what has been proposed, the ordinance, uh, that is on the table at the moment, um, is the only way that I know of that we could, um, total the time so that it doesn't go into effect at this point.

[Speaker 14] (6:20:18 - 6:20:18)
Point of information.

[Speaker 1] (6:20:19 - 6:20:28)
Well, uh, all right. Ray Raymond, were you, were you finished? Ray?

Yes, I am finished. Okay.

[Speaker 14] (6:20:29 - 6:20:47)
Point of information, Alderman Sawyer, uh, the direct legal counsel, right? Yes. Yes.

Directly to legal counsel. That's correct. Okay.

Um, question. It's my understanding that the landmark introduced their provision May 16th, 2019. Is that 2019?

Is that correct?

[Speaker 66] (6:20:50 - 6:20:50)
Correct.

[Speaker 14] (6:20:51 - 6:21:14)
All right. So, and then this is something I got, I think I should, I'm just trying to clarify if it was introduced four days before we were sworn in a new council was sworn in. How does it get validated?

Uh, in a new council, was it reintroduced or what's, what's the status of it? Since it was introduced four days before the new, uh, council was sworn in.

[Speaker 1] (6:21:14 - 6:21:21)
My understanding, according to my staff, it was a direct introduction, July of 19.

[Speaker 14] (6:21:22 - 6:21:26)
Yes. And Ciccio Lopez. So it was introduced in July of 19.

[Speaker 1] (6:21:26 - 6:21:32)
Right. And then the, according to my staff that Ciccio Lopez asked it not to be heard.

[Speaker 14] (6:21:33 - 6:21:34)
And that, that is correct.

[Speaker 2] (6:21:35 - 6:21:58)
And, and, and in fairness to him, as a new Alderman, um, we were in deference to him because he wanted time to mount his own process for socializing this. It makes sense that he would have asked that a new council not act on this. And our department deferred to his timeline.

[Speaker 14] (6:21:59 - 6:22:11)
So I guess I'm trying to understand, uh, chairman is, does the, the, the, the provision start May 16th or did it start in July of 19th?

[Speaker 1] (6:22:14 - 6:22:27)
Um, I, I believe I'm just doing the math and based on COVID I'm, I'm, I'm deferring to the department on the, on the end date of August 28th, they can work their way back.

[Speaker 14] (6:22:28 - 6:22:54)
Okay. I'm just trying to, I'm just getting curious now that when I was, and again, this is new to me. I mean, you all have been dealing with this far longer than I have, but if it was introduced May 16th, I know we generally have a general kill provision for anything that has not gone through when a new council is sworn in, which is on May, what happened to have been May 20th, uh, four days before, but you said it was introduced in July, but later on in that, in that, uh, that summer.

[Speaker 1] (6:22:55 - 6:22:55)
Correct.

[Speaker 14] (6:22:56 - 6:22:56)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (6:22:57 - 6:23:05)
So, um, I'm not, and I'm not the lawyer in the room, but I'm just because the landmark commission is not a city council committee that might not be killed.

[Speaker 14] (6:23:06 - 6:23:10)
Yeah. And that's what, again, that's why I was confused. Thank you.

I was just trying to get some clarity.

[Speaker 29] (6:23:11 - 6:23:12)
Chairman.

[Speaker 18] (6:23:12 - 6:23:24)
Chairman, just to, I think to get to Chairman Sawyer's point, I think somebody from DPD should speak about, um, when the time period starts, um, polling for the 365 days.

[Speaker 1] (6:23:25 - 6:23:30)
All right. Thanks, Lucia. Commissioner Cox, do you want to add?

[Speaker 2] (6:23:30 - 6:23:39)
Yes. I would like, uh, Michael, who is also, um, on the phone to respond to that, uh, about the specific date.

[Speaker 48] (6:23:41 - 6:23:42)
Yes. Can you hear me?

[Speaker 2] (6:23:43 - 6:23:44)
Yes. He states your name.

[Speaker 48] (6:23:44 - 6:24:25)
Yes. This is Michael Gaynor from the city's law department. In response to Alderman Sawyer's question, the landmark ordinance, um, provides that the 365 day, uh, timeline, uh, um, begins with the, um, the submission, uh, date upon which the recommendation is filed with the city council, meaning filed by the landmarks commission.

And that's what happened in May of 2019. So that's, that's why the 365 days, um, started with that May date. Uh, as we've talked about, there was a, uh, uh, two 60-ish, 60 plus day tolling of that under the emergency ordinance earlier this year.

But that's why the 365 days started in May of 2019.

[Speaker 1] (6:24:27 - 6:24:32)
All right. All right. I'm going to move to Alderman Ray Lopez.

[Speaker 4] (6:24:35 - 6:25:13)
I was going to ask a point of information, chairman, if I could start talking or not, but I figured I'd wait. But thank you, uh, chairman and commissioner. It's great seeing you.

It's good to be here. I feel remiss. I haven't seen you in quite a few, quite a few months.

Um, so I want to ask a couple of questions and my curiosity is, um, in your statement, you said that you haven't had any meetings, uh, on this matter since March, since just before the, uh, COVID, uh, situation really took place. Is that correct?

[Speaker 2] (6:25:14 - 6:25:46)
Um, well, I've had, um, I've had three meetings that I highlighted in June, uh, really quite frankly, at the encouragement of the aldermen so that I could hear from community leaders. Uh, so those were hour long conversations. I gathered an enormous amount of insight and my goal was to, to get to every group that was available before I began a larger process of engagement.

[Speaker 4] (6:25:46 - 6:26:01)
So, excuse me, the reason I'm asking is because I'm trying to understand, um, I'm assuming that the entire duration of the COVID pandemic, you have in fact, you and your staff have in fact been working the entire time. Is that correct?

[Speaker 2] (6:26:02 - 6:26:03)
It is correct.

[Speaker 4] (6:26:03 - 6:26:21)
And I have been doing research, trying to address the various issues that have been brought up to me. Yes. Fine.

Thank you, Commissioner. So you have been working for the last five and a half, six months, um, since March 17th took effect, correct?

[Speaker 2] (6:26:21 - 6:26:34)
Yes, I've been working on maybe 50 wards and, uh, twice as many projects, but I will say that I have given significant attention to Pilsen because I care very dearly about what we're talking about here.

[Speaker 4] (6:26:35 - 6:30:09)
Yeah. Okay. So the reason, again, I'm asking this is because it seems very unusual that we would come right down to the finish line, that we would only start kicking up community discussions, as you stated in June, three of them for hours on end, knowing that the July meeting is the last meeting of the city council, knowing that we're not going to be here for anything in August and knowing that there will be no opportunity for... Please don't shake your head, Commissioner. I'm trying to be respectful here.

Knowing that Alderman Sitio Lopez, regardless what happened earlier, would have no opportunity to try and present anything that his community and his residents are asking for. So I find it highly suspect, to be quite honest, to think that our department of planning and development could not multitask this entire time on a project that has actually been in the works and known about, with all due respect to all of my colleagues that were aldermen before 2019, this actually goes back since November 13th, 2018, where this council, this committee, and I remind you, Chairman, I believe we were here that day together when Alderman, then Alderman and Chairman Danny Solis, Alderman George Cardenas and then Alderman Ricardo Munoz introduced the anti-gentrification and affordable housing plan for both Pilsen and Little Village.

I remember this day very specifically because the chairman at the time got into an argument because I actually called quorum on two different committees trying to stop this concept back then, which was that somehow now we were going to focus on gentrifying the gentrification of Pilsen and even discussing the landmark status in 2018. All of this has been in DPD's wheelhouse for not just the last five months, it has been in this department's wheelhouse for the last two years. And while you may be new commissioner, I don't think there was a complete sweep of the department that could not inform you as to what was already in the works.

So to find out that we are here at the brink trying to force a situation is very, very upsetting to me. It's upsetting because you have not been all consumed with all projects in DPD. I'm serious when I say I have not seen you in months.

That aside, to say that this is what we've been going, well, this is what we have been focused on, but not being able to actually produce anything and now needing even more time to get this done, this should not be how Chicago works. We are a city who knows how to walk and chew gum simultaneously. And for us to show today that we can't do this really makes me wonder, quite frankly, about the legitimacy of many of the other projects we have that all the plates that we're trying to spin simultaneously, especially when it comes to TIF, especially when it comes to invest Southwest.

Those are major projects also. So how are you, and I'll let you answer in a second. How are you able to tell me with any confidence that you're on top of this?

Not having to worry if we're gonna come up to this.

[Speaker 61] (6:30:09 - 6:30:12)
Okay, every time. Commissioner, you wanna respond?

[Speaker 2] (6:30:13 - 6:32:28)
Just briefly, I have to put this a little bit in context. I have been here for nine months, four of which have been through the COVID-19 pandemic. Even despite that low, where I was told very specifically that the community at this moment, Commissioner Cox has some other issues on their mind and they are life and death issues.

So do what you have to do to prepare the ground, but this is not the time to talk to constituents about a historic district. I, the alderman asked, so are there other ways that we could do this? And we provided him with the material for alternatives at his request.

He brought up the issues of gentrification, displacement, affordability, legacy businesses. And for everything he brought up, we did research on how to address that issue to the point today where we have a half a dozen new tools that have not been used in any historic district in Chicago. That's the work we were doing, marshalling millions of dollars to go into his ward that we have done for no other ward in the city.

That's what I've been doing. And I have been doing it with the full support of the alderman. We put his ward logo and his name on all of the tools because I don't need any credit for it.

And we gave those materials to him and we said, please socialize them with your constituents. And from what I understand, he did hold one meeting. So I just don't agree with your characterization that I have been sitting on my hands and watching this play out.

Okay. So with that, we can agree to disagree.

[Speaker 1] (6:32:28 - 6:32:41)
We've got six other aldermen that have first questions. So I'm gonna get back to you, Raymond. But I have to say something chairman, because this speaks to what this committee has done over the years.

[Speaker 4] (6:32:41 - 6:33:38)
And while I might not be only nine months on the job, this committee already approved something that dealt with 20% affordable housing in Pilsen that dealt with giving incentives to develop affordable apartments that actually talked about purchasing more additional land for the sale while also talking about 18th Street and Blue Island being landmarked as well as modernizing industrial corridors. So it is really incredulous for anyone, especially the head of this department to say that this is the first time anything's been done because of him. Because to be quite honest, we've already done it.

And to sit here and try to take credit and go backward to make it about logos for the alderman, I call BS on that because we have already been down this road. The fact that we are here again because you have not paid sufficient attention is the real issue for me. Disregarding and trying to box in an alderman because you have dragged us out to where we are today, that falls entirely on you commissioner.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (6:33:39 - 6:33:40)
Alderman Hatton.

[Speaker 66] (6:33:42 - 6:33:43)
Thank you, chair.

[Speaker 13] (6:33:45 - 6:34:21)
I've really appreciated the conversation on this and I'm trying to wrap my head around some process things. And so this is maybe a question, commissioner, not so much for you, but Ray from legal, sorry to keep bugging you. I have a couple of questions for you guys.

So one, it's concerning to me and I feel like I still get to use the I'm new card here. How did an action come, a recommendation come from the plan commission that it sounds like there was no council action on this.

[Speaker 1] (6:34:22 - 6:34:25)
Alderman, it was a landmark commission. It's not.

[Speaker 13] (6:34:25 - 6:34:40)
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. From the landmark commission and then, but there's been no council action on it.

However, it's going to take effect is that it's concerning to me that that can happen, but can someone just confirm for me that that can happen? Yes.

[Speaker 25] (6:34:40 - 6:35:32)
Good afternoon. Ray Phillips again. Yes.

Alderman Hatton. And please, you never need to apologize for any questions to me. From a law geek standpoint, I did a little bit of research on this.

And in 1997, the city council passed amendments to this ordinance, which said that if the city council did nothing, then in a 365 day period, then yes, it becomes law. And that was a, when you look at the amendment, it's a really conscious effort by the city council to do that.

[Speaker 13] (6:35:33 - 6:36:27)
Thank you for that response. And can I ask maybe through the chair, if you can get me that research, cause I think we've got another thing to fix. So thank you for that.

And then specifically, right, taking into context the whole of the conversation, the conundrum we find ourselves in with what seems to be really well-intentioned actions, a lot of work and time, but a community and their representative very clearly not wanting this to continue. How do we stop this action? So right now we're talking about this piece of legislation that would give us more time to consider it, but how do we stop it?

What action? Cause I hear it's going to take effect if council takes no action. So what is the action that we could take today to prevent the landmark designation from going into effect?

And that's for planning or for legal?

[Speaker 2] (6:36:29 - 6:37:20)
From- We'll certainly let legal speak. But from my understanding is that city council adopted the 365 day rule because city council was the place where historic districts went to die, where they were held in perpetuity. So because they may not have been popular, the ultimate was waiting for more community support and that there were over 10 proposals that were stuck in city council.

So city council adopted a rule that either you have the courage to act or it will happen automatically after one year. And that's my understanding of how that rule came about. I appreciate that understanding.

[Speaker 13] (6:37:20 - 6:37:24)
I think, Mr. Phillips, you said that was in 1997 or 96?

[Speaker 25] (6:37:25 - 6:37:28)
Yes, that was in- I was in high school.

[Speaker 13] (6:37:28 - 6:37:40)
So I think it's time to review that. But that still gets to the basic question. What action can we take today to stop the landmark process?

So- Not today, this month. Right.

[Speaker 25] (6:37:41 - 6:38:26)
So the way for that to happen can't happen today simply because it's not on the agenda. A hearing on this matter, on a discussion of the recommendation is not on the agenda. Once it is on the agenda and this committee hears it, it can recommend to pass or not pass, do not pass or do pass.

Vote that comes out of this committee will then go to the city council, which will then vote. And that would be the way to either affirmatively approve or disapprove this ordinance.

[Speaker 13] (6:38:27 - 6:38:43)
So potentially we could have at the next meeting of this committee, we could introduce an ordinance or we could bring this landmark designation to, and we could take a vote to do not pass.

[Speaker 17] (6:38:43 - 6:38:44)
Yes.

[Speaker 13] (6:38:47 - 6:38:52)
I would put that forth as one of an options. And I'm wondering if the chairman would consider that.

[Speaker 2] (6:38:55 - 6:40:31)
May I say something? Because we've seen this all before. We've seen this happen before, time and time again in Chicago, as a result of our unwillingness to preserve neighborhoods, we have seen an acceleration of demolition.

We saw it in River North. We saw it on Milwaukee Avenue. We saw it on Burling Street, all of the places that we go and look at the gentrification of those areas, they are a result of not having the necessary tools in place to preserve those communities that were there first.

And so as a planning director for the entire city, I consider it a dereliction of my duty to not protect and not use the tools that are afforded to us to protect a neighborhood like Pilsen. And I am fine with working with the Alderman, Cecil Lopez, to give local control to these decisions. But I simply cannot watch another community be lost when all of the handwriting is on the wall.

We've seen it through the requests for demolitions. And I just don't want to wake up 10 years from now under my watch and see a neighborhood like Pilsen demolished before our very eyes because of our inaction.

[Speaker 13] (6:40:32 - 6:42:52)
Commissioner, I think that I appreciate those comments. And I think I can speak for myself and say, I'm wholeheartedly with you, right? And us using the tools available and in hearing from the residents and I really appreciated your slides going through the process on this so far.

And also though, in talking to my colleague and recognizing that the folks who put this forward, they're not here anymore. They're not here anymore, the elected officials, right? Some of the statements you mentioned that were in support from those early commission meetings, fewer than 10, knowing from my community work and from what I know from my residents, it's not the everyday people that go to commission hearings and speak to these things a lot of times.

And the city is not known for having well advertised and open processes. And one of the things I'm excited on having you as part of our city is actually in changing those. So I'm wondering in finding ourselves where we're at now, would it not be prudent to find a way to end a process that was begun before Alderman Sancho Lopez was here, before you were here, that seems to have flaws and have some issues that I'm hearing a lot of constituent, 25th Ward constituent concerns about, and to maybe look at other tools and begin a new building on what you've learned so far.

Because that issue here is, it's an imperfect designation with a lot of negative consequences for the working class community that's currently there and would only partially accomplish what we're looking for when we do have other tools. We've done demolition freezes, we're getting innovative. So I would again say, can we move this to the next meeting?

Can we actually address it? And I think a lot of folks would want to move do not pass and move forward with a different process with you guys engaging residents in the Pilsen community on really meeting the needs and looking at how we preserve not just the buildings, but the community.

[Speaker 2] (6:42:54 - 6:43:51)
Well, Alderman, I don't want to lose this tool, which is a tool which I know to be effective in my own experience of historic districts. It's not the tool, it's how you use the tool. It's what the expectations are for the tool.

We can use this tool to preserve Pilsen for the residents who are there. We have to bring additional tools to the table. And, but if we let this opportunity pass, we don't get to go back and do it again.

Once you vote down this district, Pilsen will no longer be able to come back to this to create a district, it's done. And that too gave me a reason to pause. We don't get a second bite at the apple.

[Speaker 13] (6:43:51 - 6:43:59)
What I'm asking for are six- Go a little bit more to that, actually. I'm Director Commissioner Cox. Why?

Yeah. Explain this to me.

[Speaker 2] (6:44:00 - 6:44:34)
As it's been explained to me, I'm going to have to, I don't know if Ray is able to explain or whether we have Eleanor Gorski or Deanna, but my understanding is that if we vote, if the council votes down this historic district, we do not, we are not able to bring it back a year from now after it's been socialized and there's greater support. We lose this, we lose this tool indefinitely. All right, Michael Gaynor, I don't know, can you answer that question?

[Speaker 48] (6:44:35 - 6:44:36)
Yes. Can you hear me?

[Speaker 2] (6:44:36 - 6:44:37)
Yes.

[Speaker 48] (6:44:37 - 6:45:46)
Yes, I'm sorry, everyone. Yes, Alderman, in answer to your question, as the commissioner was saying, in the landmarks ordinance, there's a provision that we refer to as the second bite, which says that unless there are significant changes, significant new evidence that comes to light that a failed landmark designation cannot be resuscitated. So, you know, the sort of, unless we were, I can't really imagine a scenario where, you know, they often talk about, oh, if you're talking about a single structure and there's a landmark proposal and it fails, but then you later find out that, you know, Abraham Lincoln slept there.

Well, then that landmark has some new significance has come to light. And therefore you could try again to redesignate it as a landmark. But in this instance, if we decided that a multi-property district, if the council decided that a multi-property district was not deserving of landmark status, I'd have a hard time thinking of, you know, facts that would say that it could be revisited.

[Speaker 13] (6:45:46 - 6:46:33)
I appreciate that. And it seems like that example you said makes a lot of sense on if it was a specific building. And also we're talking about a very large area.

I imagine we designate which area of Pilsen and come up with a whole set of reasons based on the community process that we're learning that could probably also qualify for a consideration as it would be a different proposal in a different set of buildings, but I'll stop there. But Chairman Tunney, that was one of my questions for you is still unanswered, which is, can we take this to the next meeting? Would you consider that for us to actually be able to vote on the landmark designation?

I don't know what the schedule looks like for next month.

[Speaker 1] (6:46:34 - 6:47:01)
Well, first of all, we need to pass the ordinance today that gives an additional six months up to six months. We can reject that proposal sooner than later. So we're not saying that we were going to wait a six-month period.

The ordinance says up to six months. It can be done before that up or down vote.

[Speaker 13] (6:47:01 - 6:47:07)
And is that because we're not meeting in August? And so then we would be past the deadline?

[Speaker 1] (6:47:07 - 6:47:08)
Correct.

[Speaker 15] (6:47:09 - 6:47:33)
All right. I'm going to ask Alderman Moore. David Moore.

Thank you, Chairman. Just real quick for me, from an overall city standpoint budget, there's nothing that financially impacts the city right here, right? This is a zoning ordinance.

[Speaker 2] (6:47:34 - 6:47:34)
I know.

[Speaker 1] (6:47:35 - 6:47:39)
The incentives have not been approved. It's not a budgetary issue.

[Speaker 15] (6:47:40 - 6:47:49)
Right. So the overall issue is the protection of the community, correct? That is correct.

[Speaker 1] (6:47:51 - 6:47:53)
That's what landmark ordinances do.

[Speaker 15] (6:47:53 - 6:47:54)
Right. I just want to know.

[Speaker 1] (6:47:54 - 6:48:00)
There's different feelings about that when it comes to some of Alderman Sicilopo and his neighborhood's comments.

[Speaker 15] (6:48:01 - 6:48:26)
Right. And so what it boils down to is that either the mayor looking out what she believed from the overall city standpoint and the alderman looking out for overall community standpoint. And that seems like that's where we are here.

Am I correct? Correct. That's all I needed to know.

Thank you so much. Alderman Rosanna Rodriguez.

[Speaker 1] (6:48:35 - 6:48:37)
Alderman Rosanna Rodriguez.

[Speaker 68] (6:48:37 - 6:48:41)
I'm here. I'm trying to... No.

[Speaker 1] (6:48:42 - 6:48:43)
We can hear you.

[Speaker 68] (6:48:43 - 6:49:41)
Okay. Okay. You're on.

Thank you, chairman. I came to support my colleague, Byron Sicilopo. I think the thing that worried me the most about this discussion is the fact that Byron didn't know that there was going to be this direct introduction until last minute.

And to me as an alderman, that is also scary that I would have to scramble to come to a hearing to deal with something that is so important for our constituents, right? So in this particular instance, I would really invite all my colleagues to listen to what Byron is saying, to listen to what Alderman Sicilopo is saying and to go with whatever he feels like it's better for his constituents.

[Speaker 1] (6:49:42 - 6:49:46)
Thank you. Alderman Harry Osterman.

[Speaker 20] (6:49:48 - 6:49:55)
Thank you. Chairman Toney, you're doing a great job today. Let me just say that.

I'm losing hair over this.

[Speaker 38] (6:49:55 - 6:49:56)
I know.

[Speaker 20] (6:49:56 - 6:53:58)
But you're chairman yourself, so you understand. I know. You got me beat by like three hours.

And Commissioner Cox, let me say, I appreciate that you're here from Detroit. I appreciate your insight and all the work you're doing across the city. And basically, I look at this as two conversations.

One is, what do we do today to not have the landmark designation go into effect on August 28th? Because for my colleagues on the line, once that happens, there's triggers that affect property owners and everything else. And I think that there's consensus to not have that take effect de facto.

That it should be intentional. So I think that's one part of this. I think the second part, and this goes to, I think, Alderman Sawyer and Alderman Hadden.

There are provisions to deny landmark in what I'll say a thoughtful way, which is that Alderman Sitko Lopez can introduce an ordinance saying he wants to vote this down. And then the zoning committee votes the landmark designation up or down. He similarly has the ability to introduce his ordinance about demolitions and have that be looked at by the zoning committee and have it be voted on up or down.

I think that affording that opportunity through the process of this committee should take place if that's the desire he wants to. And I think that Commissioner Cox, you and your department have the ability to talk to him about what he wants and how he wants to use those tools for his community. As passionately, Commissioner Cox, as I heard you about the future of Pilsen, I know that we could stay here till midnight tonight to hear from Alderman Sitko Lopez, because he feels more so about it as well.

And to me at the end of the day, he is the elected alderman from that community. And I think you have the ability to show him these are the tools and this is the history and this is what we've seen. But if at the end of the day, him and his community choose not to have a designation, I think we're going to respect that.

I think that we don't want to see developers come in and knock down old buildings that have been there for many, many years. But I think those are choices that collectively have to be made. And I think that you working with him and showing him these are all the tools, and quite frankly, historic designation is important, but that should not be the only tool in the toolbox.

So I think that for my colleagues, this is just how I'm hearing this and listening to this, is it's two choices. The choice today is trying to pass this ordinance to buy time. Does not mean we have to punt until February or April of next year.

The alderman for the 25th ward can introduce a motion at the September meeting or an ordinance in September meeting saying he does not want the historic designation that'll come to this committee for an up or down vote. And we'll have that conversation then. He similarly can look at demolitions and if he has an ordinance on demolitions, he can introduce that and we can have that as an up or down vote.

But if we don't do something today, August 28th landmark goes into effect. And I think that it's two conversations. And I think let's just be clear about that.

But commissioner, I think you should work closely with the alderman. And again, at the end of the day, we're going to listen to kind of what the community wants. But I think that's kind of where I'm seeing this conversation today.

So I just wanted to say that. Thank you. Thank you, alderman.

[Speaker 1] (6:53:58 - 6:54:19)
And for the record, we did receive a public statement from Raul Raimundo, co-chair of Pilsen planning committee, endorsing this tolling period extension, just FY for more work to be done in the Pilsen neighborhood. Let's see, we have alderman Cardona.

[Speaker 44] (6:54:22 - 6:54:39)
Thank you, chairman. I appreciate this conversation as well, like my colleague Haddon, but I have a question commissioner. If let me, this ordinance pauses the demolition justification in the Pilsen area.

Am I clear?

[Speaker 2] (6:54:40 - 6:54:42)
Is that right? Can you say that again?

[Speaker 44] (6:54:43 - 6:54:54)
This ordinance, this toll, it will put a pause on the demolition or gentrification that's happening in Pilsen.

[Speaker 2] (6:54:57 - 6:55:08)
It does extend to the end date, but it's not a gentrification ordinance.

[Speaker 44] (6:55:10 - 6:55:40)
So I'm not sure if that's- Well, what I mean by that is because me, I'm from North side. And when I go down to the South side, Pilsen on 18th street, I see a lot of, I see like a Logan square in Pilsen when I get out, when I go down 18th street, which makes me think like, they're going to go through gentrification. So that's why I'm asking you because, yeah.

[Speaker 2] (6:55:41 - 6:57:30)
So when I hear the- And I have worked with your colleague, Alderman Sitio Lopez, as he raises legitimate issues, I have sought nationally, what community has done that piece? Because there is no community that has done the entire thing. He raised concerns about legacy businesses.

To protect the Latino businesses inside the buildings. And we began to research what communities have made progress in protecting the businesses, not just the buildings. And I'm bringing that to the table.

He brought up the question of local control. I look nationally at models that are in place where local communities can have control over the demolition. And I'm crafting that ordinance to put in front of residents, if given the time.

He raised the question about a homeowner grant. So I've been working with the department. So I don't know what else to do.

I really don't. We have put tens and tens and tens of hours into this. And if I thought that this was going to be a tool for gentrification, I would not support it.

It's a tool to preserve the community that is there. And I need the partnership. I need the full partnership of the aldermen and those community leaders to do something that Chicago has never done before.

And that's what has kept me engaged in this conversation. But I need six months to do this process right. And that was all I was asking for with my direct introduction.

[Speaker 1] (6:57:31 - 6:57:37)
Okay. All right. Thank you.

Alderman Reilly. Alderman Reilly.

[Speaker 5] (6:57:38 - 6:58:47)
Yeah. Thank you, Chairman. First of all, I wanted to compliment Alderman Osterman for putting it so succinctly.

And I respect where both parties in this are coming from too. But at the end of the day, Alderman Sig Cho Lopez is the elected representative of the 25th Ward. And I say this as someone with a quite a long track record of landmarking.

And so I think, as Harry said, in order for the alderman to have options and to decide whether to engage in a further dialogue with the department or not, we do need to pass this tolling or the one outcome that Alderman Sig Cho Lopez wants to avoid, this landmark district going into effect, that will occur. And so again, I'll ultimately defer to how our colleague Sig Cho Lopez wants to proceed. I think it would personally be a mistake for him to turn down this tolling opportunity because that would force the question.

So that said, I think we should have a roll call on this. And therefore I move do pass.

[Speaker 3] (6:58:49 - 6:58:50)
One second before...

[Speaker 5] (6:58:51 - 6:58:53)
Hold on a second.

[Speaker 1] (6:58:53 - 6:59:08)
Hold on a second. There's a motion on the floor. A roll call.

So before we take the roll call, I'm gonna call on Alderman Sig Cho Lopez to make his concluding remarks. And then we will have a roll call.

[Speaker 3] (6:59:09 - 7:01:28)
Yeah, thank you, Chairman. And I appreciate that. And I appreciate all my colleagues feedback on this one.

I think it's an important opportunity for us to have a really important conversation because unfortunately, I think there's a lot of misconceptions in terms of the role of departments and the role of the alderman. And I hear my colleague, Alderman Osterman, I appreciate your very simple assessment. And the reality is Commissioner Cox that the zoning matter, this is a legislative matter and this is a 25th ward matter.

So I have to be very concrete and real with you. Your duty in this is provide the tools to local aldermen so that we can do what's best for our community. It is not your duty, however, to linger proposals despite the observations of the community of myself.

So again, I just wanna make sure that it's very clear because at the end of the day, the executive branch or legislative branch, we have to respect each other. I also wanna make sure that we have a public commitment. I think what worried me is that after one year, I did not get the opportunity to vote this in committee up or down.

I do have like many of my colleagues, I think they're right. And I appreciate the alderman feedback and your feedback, Commissioner. I think I've gone above and beyond.

I don't know how many aldermen actually take this kind of feedback. Actually gone, I think beyond and below, in terms of not only my community, but now you have now I think plenty of feedback from zoning committee members. So I would like to make sure that I don't want, I cannot in good consciousness have this linger and have my low income residents, working class residents go in front of Landmark Commission.

Landmark Commission for residents that are struggling, this red tape, unfortunately is gonna harm us. And I'm sorry, Commissioner. I can agree with that.

I agree with some of your tools. I'm sorry, but I have to disagree. And I'm glad that we are here on public record.

So I would like to say that we can move into maybe give the extension just as long as we can commit to put this item in front of the next zoning committee so that we can vote it down because that's gonna be what the community and myself is gonna go behind. So that's the motion chairman.

[Speaker 1] (7:01:30 - 7:02:04)
There's already a motion on the motion. Alderman Ciccio Lopez. So I'm gonna ask for the roll call vote.

Alderman Riley renews his motion and start with the roll call. Now, if you vote yes, you're voting to extend the tolling period for another up to another six months. It could be before then, but the due date would be January 31 of next year.

Mr. Chairman. Alderman Dowell, you have a point of information. Alderman Dowell.

Yes, don't get upset with me. I'm not upset. I'm not upset.

[Speaker 16] (7:02:04 - 7:02:23)
Okay. I just wanna be clear that the only thing that we're voting on in this ordinance is the extension of the deadline. There's no other, uh, anything, nothing more can happen with this ordinance.

[Speaker 1] (7:02:23 - 7:02:39)
You are 100% correct, Alderman Dowell. It is only one thing, extend the deadline up to January 31st of next year. Point of information, Mr. Chairman. Alderman Burnett on a point of information.

[Speaker 11] (7:02:40 - 7:02:46)
Yeah, so is it clear that Alderman Lopez was overseeing the extending of the deadline?

[Speaker 1] (7:02:47 - 7:02:49)
I'm sorry, you're breaking up, Alderman.

[Speaker 11] (7:02:50 - 7:02:58)
Was it expressed by Alderman Sitio Lopez that he's okay with extending this for another six months?

[Speaker 1] (7:02:59 - 7:03:16)
I think he, well, my listening to Alderman Sitio Lopez is that he would agree to that as long as he could put it on in an expedient manner to be heard by the Landmarks Commission sooner than later. All right.

[Speaker 3] (7:03:17 - 7:03:22)
Well, point of information, Alderman, I said clearly at the next zoning meeting.

[Speaker 1] (7:03:22 - 7:03:41)
Yeah, but I understand your intention and I'm going to work earnestly like I have with you to make sure that it's done in a very expedient manner. I'm not going to say it's the September meeting, but I'm going to, we're going to work with the department and you, and I guarantee you we will get it on in short notice. All right.

[Speaker 3] (7:03:41 - 7:03:43)
I have to object to that.

[Speaker 1] (7:03:43 - 7:04:13)
Okay. Alderman Riley, you have a motion on the floor. We've asked for a roll call vote on extending the tolling period for the Landmark Recommendation Ordinance to January of 2021, the 31st.

We're going to call the roll. I'm going to start with, let's see. Sitio Lopez.

Well, let me get started. Alderman Hopkins.

[Speaker 26] (7:04:15 - 7:04:15)
No.

[Speaker 1] (7:04:17 - 7:04:38)
Okay. Alderman Dowell. No.

Alderman Slater. Aye. Alderman Ray Lopez.

Original Lopez voting no. Alderman David Moore.

[Speaker 15] (7:04:39 - 7:04:39)
No.

[Speaker 1] (7:04:43 - 7:04:51)
Alderman Mike Rodriguez. Alderman Sitio Lopez.

[Speaker 3] (7:04:51 - 7:05:09)
Point of information, Alderman, I think that this is a very, I mean, it was a very simple vote and now it becomes very complicated. So point of information, I mean, if you strike this down, then the landmark will become law.

[Speaker 71] (7:05:09 - 7:05:11)
Yes, sir. Correct.

[Speaker 3] (7:05:13 - 7:05:18)
Right. So, I mean, it is a very simple thing to put in the next one in committee.

[Speaker 1] (7:05:18 - 7:05:26)
I don't know why. I will work with you as I have. You know, I've worked with you on this.

Are you voting yes or no on this?

[Speaker 3] (7:05:29 - 7:05:29)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (7:05:31 - 7:05:45)
I mean, come on, chairman. Okay. Well, let's let, we can, we can vote to reconsider, but let's keep moving.

Let's vote to reconsider. Alderman... Vote to reconsider.

Well, we're not finished with the roll call.

[Speaker 9] (7:05:46 - 7:05:48)
Rodriguez is a yes. Sorry, I was away.

[Speaker 1] (7:05:49 - 7:05:59)
Rodriguez is a yes. Alderman Burnett. Yes.

Alderman Ravoyas.

[Speaker 71] (7:06:00 - 7:06:01)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (7:06:03 - 7:06:14)
Alderman Cardona. Yes. Alderman Waguespack.

Alderman Waguespack.

[Speaker 15] (7:06:15 - 7:06:15)
No.

[Speaker 1] (7:06:19 - 7:06:49)
Alderman Villegas. Yes. Alderman Riley.

Yes. Alderman Kappelman. Alderman Kappelman.

Alderman Osterman. Yes. Alderman Hatton.

Yes. Alderman... Chairman Tony votes aye.

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Let me, let me get... Are you...

[Speaker 26] (7:06:49 - 7:06:53)
I have a point of order before the final vote is announced, sir.

[Speaker 1] (7:06:54 - 7:06:58)
Yes, sir. Well, first of all, Alderman Dowell first. And then...

[Speaker 16] (7:06:59 - 7:07:06)
Chairman Tony, now that I've heard the will of Alderman Siccio-Lopez, I want to change my vote to yes.

[Speaker 1] (7:07:08 - 7:07:25)
I think I'm going to... I think what I'm going to do is when we do to reconsider, we'll get the motion to reconsider and then we'll do the roll call again. Okay.

Is that... Alderman Hopkins, is that your question? Or point of information?

[Speaker 26] (7:07:25 - 7:07:47)
Yeah, the reconsideration may not be necessary if the final tally for the vote hasn't been called. We're still in the roll call. It has not closed.

If the chair in his discretion would leave, will allow us to change our vote. I wish to change my vote to yes. So this may obliviate the need to reconsider possibly.

[Speaker 1] (7:07:48 - 7:08:04)
Okay, let me, let me go back. We've talked with law. I'm going to do...

I'm doing a new roll call on this initiative. So we're going to start over. Point of order, chairman.

It's Alderman Lopez, I'm sorry.

[Speaker 4] (7:08:08 - 7:08:13)
Alderman Ray Lopez. Yes, how is it that we're able to restart a roll call when we've already done it?

[Speaker 1] (7:08:15 - 7:08:21)
Okay, we can ask legal, but I think if we, even if we did, I think we had votes to pass it.

[Speaker 4] (7:08:21 - 7:08:36)
I understand that chairman, but I think that the precedent that I've seen over the last two days where votes are stopped midway, because aldermen are uncertain, to say it politely, of what's being done, is a bad precedent.

[Speaker 1] (7:08:36 - 7:08:41)
Okay, to finish this vote, if we have to reconsider it, because now the vote...

[Speaker 16] (7:08:41 - 7:08:43)
It wasn't uncertain, I changed my vote.

[Speaker 1] (7:08:44 - 7:09:05)
Okay, okay, let me do this. We did the call and I was the last person to vote. The tally on the tolling ordinance is 11 yays.

And how many nays? I have five. And we have five nays.

Is there a motion to reconsider that vote?

[Speaker 16] (7:09:06 - 7:09:09)
Yes, I move that we reconsider the motion to reconsider.

[Speaker 15] (7:09:09 - 7:09:11)
I, David Moore, second.

[Speaker 1] (7:09:11 - 7:09:20)
Okay, all those in favor? Aye. Aye.

Okay, so now we're going to start the roll. We're going to start the roll call again. Chairman, before you...

[Speaker 3] (7:09:20 - 7:09:23)
Point of information, Alderman, before you take the vote, please.

[Speaker 4] (7:09:24 - 7:09:36)
So first off, point of order, Chairman. Two of the individuals who asked for the reconsideration were on the losing side. We need someone who motioned, who voted for the ordinance to make that.

[Speaker 9] (7:09:36 - 7:09:38)
I, Alderman Rodriguez, move to reconsider.

[Speaker 4] (7:09:38 - 7:09:39)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (7:09:39 - 7:09:48)
Osterman, seconds. Okay, all right, thank you for that clarification. Sorry, Chairman, just wanted to make it legal.

All right, Alderman Hopkins.

[Speaker 26] (7:09:51 - 7:09:55)
Are we in a... Is this the roll call on the reconsideration?

[Speaker 1] (7:09:55 - 7:10:04)
Yes, it is, yes, it is. I vote... We extended this up to a six month period.

Alderman Hopkins.

[Speaker 26] (7:10:04 - 7:10:07)
Don't we have to vote on the motion to reconsider before we vote?

[Speaker 1] (7:10:07 - 7:10:09)
We did. We did, okay.

[Speaker 26] (7:10:09 - 7:10:11)
I vote yes on the item.

[Speaker 1] (7:10:14 - 7:10:51)
Okay, Alderman Dowell. Yes. Alderman Sawyer.

Aye. Alderman Thiel. Alderman Raymond Lopez.

Yes. Alderman David Moore. Yes.

Alderman Mike Rodriguez. Aye. Alderman Sicho Lopez.

Aye. Alderman Burnett. Yes.

Alderman Raboyas.

[Speaker 71] (7:10:52 - 7:10:53)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (7:10:55 - 7:11:08)
I think that was an aye. It sounded like a no. A distressful one, I might say, but...

Alderman Cardona. Aye. Alderman Waguespack.

[Speaker 71] (7:11:09 - 7:11:10)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (7:11:11 - 7:11:20)
Alderman Austin. Alderman Villegas. Aye.

Alderman Riley.

[Speaker 71] (7:11:20 - 7:11:21)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (7:11:22 - 7:11:46)
Alderman Capelman. Alderman Osterman. Aye.

Alderman Hadden. Aye. Chairman Toney votes aye.

So we have 16 ayes and no nays. So this item is passed. Can I get a motion to reconsider, I guess, on that too?

[Speaker 8] (7:11:47 - 7:11:49)
Alderman, Alderman. No. Who is that?

[Speaker 46] (7:11:49 - 7:11:59)
This is Jeff Levine. Oh, Jeff Levine. We did the motion to reconsider, and you can only do that once.

[Speaker 1] (7:11:59 - 7:12:09)
Thank you. It's been a long day. Thank you, Jeff.

Yep. All right, so this item is passed. I don't think there's any more...

Move to adjourn, Chairman.

[Speaker 56] (7:12:09 - 7:12:11)
Alderman Lopez. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (7:12:11 - 7:12:19)
No further business. Alderman Ray Lopez makes a motion to adjourn. All those in favor.

Aye.

[Speaker 44] (7:12:19 - 7:12:24)
Aye. Aye. Chairman, you did a fantastic job.

[Speaker 1] (7:12:24 - 7:12:27)
Any objections? No objections.

[Speaker 44] (7:12:28 - 7:12:28)
The meeting is adjourned.

[Speaker 1] (7:12:29 - 7:12:43)
Thank you for your patience. And, Alderman Tito Lopez, my commitment is to continue to work with you and the department to do what's best for you, your neighborhood, and your ward. Thank you.

And hopefully... And chaos well.

[Speaker 11] (7:12:44 - 7:12:49)
Hopefully there can be an understanding before the next meeting so we don't go through this again.

[Speaker 1] (7:12:51 - 7:12:57)
You got it. Have a great evening, everybody. Have a great week.

Thank you, Chairman. Thank you. Okay.
