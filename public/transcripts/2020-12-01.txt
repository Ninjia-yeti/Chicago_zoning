[Speaker 25] (12:44 - 12:46)
Can you hear me, Mr. Chairman?

[Speaker 1] (12:47 - 12:48)
We can. Proceed, sir.

[Speaker 25] (12:49 - 16:01)
Good morning, Chairman Tunney and members of the committee. I'm Ward Miller, Executive Director of the nonprofit Preservation Advocacy Group Preservation Chicago. You should have a separate four-page written statement in your packets before you.

We are testifying in support of the historic and cultural assets of the Pilsen community and in support of the Chicago Landmark District, which we believe in our heart of hearts is the best and most lawful, tried and true, and reasonable path to protecting one of Chicago's most vulnerable and historically significant communities from destruction, displacement, and upheaval. In this pursuit, the proposed Chicago Landmark District of 900 buildings will not only protect the fabric and the buildings of the community, but also its residents, its people, longtime business owners, and renters. The historic buildings of Pilsen are unique in their architecture and design and offering affordable dwellings and homes for many residents.

Without some type of solid, tried, and true protections, we believe from our experience in working in Chicago neighborhoods for many years that Pilsen will no longer be the same community in a short time. It will be most likely pulverized by new market rate developments, as witnessed recently, and will force its long-term residents and stakeholders out of the community. We are also of the opinion and belief that doing nothing or replacing a seminal landmark district with a substitute ordinance opens the door to many legal challenges in the future, and in the long run does not allow protection of these amazing historic properties of this culturally rich and diverse community.

As of last week, there are approximately 280 affidavits from owners of buildings opposing landmark district designation. However, that's roughly 300 owners and represents approximately one-third of the 900 property owners in the proposed district boundaries. So, what has happened to the other 600-plus property owners?

And why have they not come forth? Is this, the majority, a whopping two-thirds silent? And if so, why?

Are they in support of the landmark district? Certainly, the great majority of owners have not come forth in opposition to a Chicago landmark district, despite numerous community meetings and vocal and sometimes intimidating opposition fronts. Preservation Chicago placed the Pilsen community on our most endangered list in 2006, some 14 years ago, and suggested as one of the ideas that a landmark district be considered.

Nothing was done, and now we have the opportunity to do something. We again stressed landmark designation in 2014 when St. Adelbert's was added to our list of most endangered three times and have reached out to members of the community. We are also encouraging some type of middle ground where the Alderman Ciccio-Lopez's proposed ordinance be considered for an area outside the district boundaries to protect these amazing buildings and the area surrounding it to protect all residents and buildings of Pilsen.

[Speaker 1] (16:05 - 16:20)
Thank you, Ward. Our next speaker is Nick Costafidous. Hopefully, I get it pronounced right.

Nick Costafidous.

[Speaker 28] (16:22 - 16:24)
Nick, please press star six to unmute.

[Speaker 35] (16:26 - 16:27)
Did that work?

[Speaker 28] (16:28 - 16:28)
Yes.

[Speaker 35] (16:28 - 19:27)
That worked? Yeah. Thank you.

Good morning, Chairman and committee members. Thank you for your time this morning. No one likes to go against an Alderman, so I will be one of the few brave enough to testify.

I am strongly opposed to Alderman Rose's proposed spot for the down zoning, spot down zoning for Milwaukee Avenue and the TOD corridor. I'm deeply familiar with this part of the city as I live a short five-minute walk from the area. I've also been slowly renovating neglected old buildings, trying to breathe some life into them on the stretch of Milwaukee just past Diversity.

Turning around one building at a time is no shortage of effort and work. You may not know this, but currently many of those storefronts along that stretch of Milwaukee are suffering. Creating more potential hardship and devaluing the commercial landlord's property during this time is unreasonable.

These landlords are doing all they can to shoulder the remaining tenants with rent freezes and no eviction. We lost our most well-known tenant, Crown Liquors, right at the corner of the Milwaukee Diversity corridor just recently to see that very thing play out in our current economic climate. It was a shock to me to see Alderman Rosa now attempting to arbitrarily down zone a portion of our commercial corridor that's already struggling.

I am told that his reason is preservation. Well, these down zones have been out there for over a year and there have been no massive teardowns or massive redevelopment proposals. There's no threat and this exercise is needless.

Further, this city designated a TOD corridor and it was designed to accept some change in density. The Logan Square Chamber of Commerce, even, by the way, whom Alderman Rosa does not recognize as a stakeholder because they do not agree with him on how he conducts community outreach, represents over 150 small businesses and local property owners and submitted an excellent letter that I urge you all to read. Because Rosa will not acknowledge the chamber or seat them on his ward's committee, the chamber decided to even put a legislative goal into their agenda for more transparent community zoning process.

I think that's pretty ironic given all the mandate claiming in Logan Square. And report back to relevant city departments in hope of a voice. I cannot imagine that the city as a whole and the mayor would agree with these down zonings.

Alderman Rosa's mantra is, you know, we need to give the community a voice. However, the only voice he recognizes are those who agree with him. It is super important to note that none of the impacted property owners on this agenda or the chamber were included in any meetings.

They also did not receive any phone calls or correspondence from the alderman. He dismisses his obligation to the Logan Square economy and basically only serves those who agree with his very skewed agenda. I ask you to vote no on these down zonings.

Alderman Rosa's abuse of power here and intimidation to those who disagree with him must be acknowledged and we need your help to stop him.

[Speaker 1] (19:31 - 19:48)
Our next speaker is Merrill. Merrill Goosner. Try it again.

Merrill Goosner. Yes. Here I am.

Thank you.

[Speaker 29] (19:48 - 22:56)
Chairman Toney and members of the zone. Good morning. How are you?

I'm Merrill Goosner and I'm here today on behalf of the six owners of units belonging to the 271315 North Pine Grove Condominium Association. Our four and a half story property lies directly east of the Second Church of Christ Scientist, which is item number 2531-T1 on your agenda. Their developer is seeking R6 zoning to use the church site, about half of which is now surface parking, to build a seven story building with 26 residential units, two large rooms for the church and 30 below grade parking spaces.

This historic church, except for its southern facade on Wrightwood, will be destroyed in the process. Today, we are asking you to postpone your decision until you receive studies showing how such a project will affect light and shadow on all units, east, north and west of the church property. The developer should also evaluate how the proposed project would affect parking and traffic in our neighborhood.

We asked for those studies after the community meeting in August. The owners have not fully responded. The only study we received was a schematic study of shadows from which I estimate the proposed development will eliminate about 70% of our units direct sunlight.

Our association outlined our concerns in a letter sent to all members of this committee last month. In brief, first, the proposed development will reduce our property values by eliminating our western views and more than half of our daytime sunlight. Due to limited setbacks, it will also create a canyon-like atmosphere at street level.

Second, Pine Grove is a narrow residential street, frequently blocked by commercial vehicles. Adding a 30-space parking lot with only a single lane driveway for entrance and egress will substantially add to congestion and traffic delays on the block. Third, the church plans to ask the city to reserve local street parking for church members during church activities.

This will add to local congestion and penalize existing residents in the area who will lose access to street parking during the restricted hours. Let me be clear. We are not against redevelopment of these parcels, but the developer's plan allocates very little space to the church.

It's the equivalent of two units for the church over and above the 26 that will be for sale. The current zoning provides the developer sufficient height to build 12 to 15 condos similar to ours, plus the equivalent of two units for church space. From an aesthetic perspective, this smaller development would maintain the ambiance of the block and enhance the attractiveness of the immediate neighborhood.

The proposed project does just the opposite on both counts. The church and its small congregation have repeatedly told the community they cannot afford to maintain its current space, yet they have provided no economic rationale as to why a project requiring R6 zoning is needed to preserve its presence in the community now that they've concluded it is impossible for them to preserve the only parts of the church with any architectural significance, its dome and sanctuary.

Given the church's failure to provide the studies we've asked for, or an economic rationale for a project of this scale.

[Speaker 1] (22:57 - 23:16)
Thank you, Mr. Thank you, Merrill. Your time is up. Our next speaker is Adriana Diaz, Adriana Diaz.

[Speaker 31] (23:17 - 23:19)
Hi, good morning. Can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (23:20 - 23:21)
We can proceed.

[Speaker 31] (23:21 - 26:28)
Good morning to the members of the Zoning Committee. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to address you about the most serious issue currently affecting my family. I implore you to not pass the ordinance to make Pilsen a historical landmark district.

Please do not place an extra layer of bureaucracy on the homeowners that fall within the historic zone, homeowners such as my mother. My parents, Carlos and Dolores Gutierrez arrived in Chicago from Mexico as newlyweds in 1957. Almost immediately, they settled on the corner of 18th Street and Laughlin.

Pilsen was a welcoming community to Mexican immigrants like them. As you know, the neighborhood was largely Polish and Bohemian at that time. But let's be honest here, Pilsen was available to Mexican families like my parents because whites were moving out of the city and into the suburbs in search of better schools, homes and employment.

Redlining was in place. My parents lived in Pilsen when it was not trendy. It was labeled blighted.

It didn't capture the curiosity of the hip and cool. It suffered from disinvestment. My parents, like many others in their generation, laid down their roots and called this neighborhood home.

They involved themselves in local politics, fought for educational equity and demanded that Benito Juarez High School be built. They belonged to St. Pius and St. Adelbert parishes. They owned a business and they were early members of the Mexican Civic Society and the 18th Street Business Association and involved in many several school councils.

One might call them model citizens, especially at a time when immigrants like now are disparaged by elected politicians. When my father died, Father Chuck Dahm of St. Pius referred to my parents as pillars of the community. At 85 years young, my beautiful healthy mother still lives in her building with my siblings and their children.

My home is down the street from hers. I come to you to speak about people like my mother, the long-term Mexican residents in Pilsen. As you may or may not know, since the year 2000, it is estimated that 10,000 Mexican working class residents have left Pilsen and many of these displacements were caused by rising housing costs.

That number is staggering. In an empirical study published by the Journal of American Planning, it found that since Brooklyn Heights in New York City became a historic district, the majority of the people who live there now are white and affluent. A reasonable person would argue that if you designate Pilsen a historic district, a second wave of displacement will occur because people like my mother will not be able to keep up with the exacting standards of the historic district.

Therefore, a seemingly innocuous policy such as this one is at its core insidious in nature because it only exacerbates the gentrification process. So let's be clear. Why are we valuing bohemian-inspired buildings over people's lives?

Alderman Citro Lopez has proposed a freeze on the demolition. Long-term residents like my mother are not interested in tearing down their buildings.

[Speaker 1] (26:28 - 26:44)
They just want- Thank you, Adriana. Our next speaker is Bruce Anderson. Hello, Bruce Anderson, please.

[Speaker 45] (26:44 - 29:17)
Yes. Is this Bruce Anderson? Can you hear me?

Thank you, sir. Please proceed. Okay.

My name is Bruce Anderson. I'm the treasurer of Logan Square Preservation. We're a 40-year-old organization in Logan Square with 275 paid members.

We're the largest such organization in Logan Square, and we're here today to testify in favor of the downzoning ordinances related to Milwaukee Avenue. In 2016, we put a referendum on the ballot in certain Logan Square precincts. It said the aldermen shall preserve the buildings and historic character of Logan Square through zoning policy.

It got 93% of the vote, and I defy you to find any public policy referendum that gets that kind of support. In 2004, we downzoned most of Logan Boulevard. Has Logan Square suffered?

In 2005, we advocated for a landmark district, and there was a lot of noise and opposition, as I think you'll understand today. So we put that question on the ballot in the 35th Ward, and it got 87% support. The people of this community support the historic character of the neighborhood, and they want it protected.

I think you'll even see that in the letters of opposition to these downzoning. All of them reflect the fact that they're saying, we support historic preservation, but we're against the downzoning, but they don't provide any alternative. And finally, I'd like to address the aldermen on this committee.

In February of 2019, you all ran in an aldermanic race. In the 35th Ward, Alderman Rosa had a well-funded opponent, and she used the potential downzoning of Milwaukee Avenue as her major campaign issue. And Alderman Rosa won every single precinct that was adjacent to these parcels.

He got 63% in those parcels. He did better in those parcels and in those precincts than he did in the remainder of the Ward. So what Alderman Rosa is doing here is supporting the will of his constituents.

And I would ask you, the aldermen here, also to support us and support our well-expressed desire to protect our neighborhood.

[Speaker 1] (29:22 - 29:24)
Our next speaker is Alvin Salinas.

[Speaker 32] (29:31 - 29:32)
Hi. Can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (29:33 - 29:35)
Yes. Could you identify yourself and begin?

[Speaker 32] (29:35 - 32:38)
Yes. Okay. I'll begin.

Hi. My name is Alvin Salinas, and I am a lifelong native-born resident of Pilsen. I was born in Pilsen.

I grew up and was raised in Pilsen since 1987. And I can definitively say that the art that exists in Pilsen is spontaneous and purposely free. And we the artists of Pilsen do not want your predatory governmental regulations on something so free and noble and humble as street art.

Regulating art is literally the opposite of what the awesome art of Pilsen is all about. The commission of the Department of Planning and Development is an economic predator who was brought in by the mayor, Mayor Light Fascist, to financially devastate and wipe out the people of Pilsen and lend his pockets and the pockets of unjustly rich, the rich filthy few at the expense of our lives during the worst pandemic in a hundred years or more. It is absolutely criminal that the property taxes for homeowners in Pilsen have sharply been increased about 500% in the last two decades alone.

Commissioner Maurice Cox is deceptively fighting against the will of the vast majority of the people in Pilsen. These liquor licenses that were awarded to these newer taverns without the permission or consent of the residents of Pilsen affect the quality of life of our local community in Pilsen because our local grammar schools, local high schools are in such close proximity. This blatant sabotaging of our community is a dishonest con that is doubly shameful and criminal during this worst pandemic economic depression perhaps ever.

Landmarking is a tool used by overprivileged swindlers to displace the native residents of Pilsen. These multi-million dollar projects that come to our ward, they demand even more concessions from the people of Pilsen. Landmarking increases property taxes, forces stricter codes and increases the need for higher costing rehab work.

All of the points, all of this points and proves that the DPD is historically pro-gentrification. Instead of using the TIF money for the people, they're just coming in and using it for large corporate interests. So that's why we asked to vote no on the historic landmark district for Pilsen.

We asked for a demolition freeze.

[Speaker 1] (32:38 - 32:46)
Thank you. Your time is up. Our next speaker is Virginia Lugo.

Virginia Lugo.

[Speaker 25] (32:56 - 33:02)
Please press star six on your phone to unmute Virginia Lugo.

[Speaker 40] (33:08 - 33:09)
Hello. Hello.

[Speaker 28] (33:09 - 33:10)
Can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (33:10 - 33:15)
Yes. Virginia Lugo. State your name and proceed, please.

[Speaker 28] (33:15 - 36:18)
Yes. Hello. My name is Virginia Lugo.

I thank the committee for allowing me to speak at this meeting as this landmark district is a very important issue for Pilsen residents. This is a matter that will affect many families, particularly those who are low-income and long-term residents. I'm urging that you vote no on the historic landmark designation for Pilsen.

This community was built by immigrants just like the rest of this country. My parents immigrated from Mexico and called Pilsen their home. My mother bought a property along 18th Street and now owns a bit of that American dream.

But that has come at a high price. The high taxes, rules, and regulations they already have to follow, plus the added high cost of living in the city, and with the recent approved budget, it is making it that much harder for already burdened families to live in Pilsen. Do you remember there's a pandemic going on, too?

The properties might not need repairs now, but eventually they'll need maintenance and it'll cost them a lot more with all the restrictions, rules, and regulations they'll have to follow, not to mention the difficult process of obtaining permits. Just ask the owners of Restaurant Carnitas Uruapan. A permit to update a sign that should have cost $150 ended up costing $3,000, including an expediter speed to help them navigate through the process.

The high cost of repairs and maintenance will obligate low-income and long-term property owners to either sell their homes or lose them to the fines and fees they may get. Commissioner Cox and his department have lied to our faces, stating that the cost for repairs and maintenance will not change. That is simply not true.

And the U.S. Secretary of the Interior Standards for Rehabilitation of Historic Buildings that was adopted by the city states that property owners will have to maintain the facade and roof as it originally was designed. It includes any distinctive features like craftsmanship, millwork, masonry, and windows that need to match the historic design, operation, and material. Who makes these kinds of materials and designs anymore?

Where will we be able to find those pulley system windows from the 1800s or other material that is no longer used or made? The rise in rent and cost of living has contributed to Latinos moving out of Pilsen. And with this landmark designation, more people will leave, further displacing and justifying it.

This will dramatically change the demographic, but most importantly, will lose its vibrancy and Latino culture it is known for. We believe that this designation is not the only tool to control and stop demolition. Alderman Byron C.

Chalopis introduced a demolition-free proposal that would put a moratorium for demolition while creating options to retain, promote, and increase affordable housing in Pilsen. A similar measure along the 606 Trail has prevented developers from demolishing without first having a public meeting about each request. I urge you to support Alderman Byron C.

Chalopis' demolition-free ordinance. We have gathered more than 300 affidavits of Pilsen residents, a letter from Pilsen community organizations, and a letter from Congressman Jesus Chul Garcia, who oppose this designation and are being presented before you. So I urge you to please hear and support.

[Speaker 1] (36:18 - 36:26)
Thank you, Virginia. Your time is up. Our next speaker is Kyle Fran.

F-R-A-Y-N. I think I got it.

[Speaker 42] (36:26 - 36:31)
Hi, I'm Kyle Fran. Can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (36:31 - 36:33)
Kyle. Kyle, is that you?

[Speaker 42] (36:33 - 36:35)
Yeah, this is Kyle Fran. Can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (36:36 - 36:37)
Yes, you can proceed. Thank you.

[Speaker 42] (36:38 - 39:08)
Thank you. My name is Kyle Fran, and I'm opposed to the Pilsen Landmark District. I've lived in Chicago since birth, and unlike the outside special interest groups in support, I am an owner-occupant of a building in the proposed district for more than 10 years.

I'm personally impacted by the restrictions created through this proposed district, which limits the dormer I otherwise could add to my attic to create additional living space for my growing family. This proposal is disastrous for other long-term residents and businesses in the neighborhood. Reading the story of Urban Carnitas trying to renovate the sign on their business is a chilling example of how the district would make life harder for small businesses.

Furthermore, there is a serious lack of trust in the process that DPD has chosen to take on the Landmark District. DPD staff testified that a couple of pending demolition permits were justifiable reason to accelerate the approval process of the Landmark District in May of 2019, since when does a government policy that impacts an entire community and thousands of people more important than a few dilapidated buildings? Those demolition permits were pulled back, and DPD had another nine months to engage the community between May of 2019 and March 2020, pre-COVID.

Our aldermen facilitated three meetings throughout the summer of 2019, where our community showed significant disapproval and concern over the proposed district. Our community asked many detailed questions on how the Landmark District would be applied, and the response we roughly got was, we'll work with the community to develop guidelines once it is approved. DPD effectively asked our community to sign a blank check on the Landmark District.

This is unacceptable. Commissioner Cox has repeatedly characterized the six-month extension from the summer as a unanimous vote of continued community engagement. I listened to that meeting.

DPD played a waiting game for one year, backed our aldermen into a corner where the only option was to vote for an extension or the Landmark District would automatically go into effect. This is implied dishonesty here. The overwhelming majority of property owners and community members who have engaged in this Landmark District are opposed to it.

This is documented in both the DPD survey and the additional work done by our community to invite engagement. Will DPD and the Commission respect a democratic process and represent the will of the people and vote no on the Landmark District? Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (39:11 - 39:15)
Our next speaker is Shuman Shahadi.

[Speaker 60] (39:20 - 39:22)
Hello, this is Shuman Shahadi. Can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (39:23 - 39:23)
We can.

[Speaker 60] (39:23 - 40:30)
Proceed. Thank you very much, Chairman. Thank you to the Zoning Committee for listening.

I am not in favor of the downzoning, particularly as it relates to Milwaukee Avenue. And my concern, or I should say our family's concern, is based off of the lack of retail and the lack of density on that particular stretch. We're concerned that the downzoning would be prohibitive for density, which we think would be incredibly important for vitality as it relates to the commercial corridor.

We already have a lot of stores that are empty. That was even prior to the COVID-19. And I do believe that a lot of property owners are hurting because of that.

Obviously, we would like to bring a strong, vital commercial corridor to the area. I do believe that the density of that particular thoroughfare of Milwaukee Avenue would be helpful in making sure that occurs. And for those reasons, we think that it would be beneficial to make sure that we keep density and keep vitality on the stretch of Milwaukee.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (40:33 - 40:36)
Thank you. Our next speaker is Dahlia Radecki.

[Speaker 46] (40:44 - 40:46)
Good morning. Can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (40:47 - 40:51)
We can. Would you introduce yourself to us and begin speaking, please?

[Speaker 46] (40:52 - 43:16)
Good morning, Zoning Committee members. My name is Dahlia Radecki, a resident and homeowner in Pilsen, and I represent the group Mi Hogar from the Resurrection Project. Our mission of our Mi Hogar group is to promote accessible and affordable living to our residents and protect our families and our communities.

We stand united with Pilsen residents and homeowners, and we have collected over 600 letters of the over 500 submitted in opposition of the Pilsen Historical Landmark District. We only could find 12 who support. They call Pilsen their home.

The Landmark District and our Pilsen community would not only cost property taxes to go up, which will affect the economy of our community, where families will have no choice but leave our community. Our residents do not have means of renovating repairs that meet the Landmark District standards. The cost of permits will cause a threat to remain in the neighborhood.

Most of the homeowners and businesses affected by the Landmark District are low-income seniors who do not have the necessary means to upgrade their buildings and object to having excessive restrictions on their property. The district will also attract higher income demographic and raise our property taxes. If this Pilsen Landmark District is made permanent, it would push our residents and displaced Hispanic families unable to afford the high cost of maintenance on their buildings and unfortunate needed rent to pay for it.

This is a very difficult and painful financial burden for our families to remain in our community. We cannot and will not permit it against our hard work with our community. I support a temporary halt on all demolition in Pilsen until a plan of Pilsen affordable housing and businesses have been finalized.

Please, I plead with you to take in consideration the hardship that this Landmark District will cause our homeowners, businesses, and renters that call Pilsen their home.

[Speaker 1] (43:17 - 43:23)

We're here to urge you all to vote no on the Landmark District and instead vote yes for Alderman Byron Sigcho-Lopez's demolition-free zone ordinance. I just want to start by saying that Ward Miller's numbers are wrong. As of the most recent count of 340 owners surveyed, 323 stayed in opposition and at least 17 support the Landmark.

This is statistically a more than significant sample size. The Landmark ordinance is the wrong solution to Pilsen's problems. It proclaims to preserve a neighborhood while placing exorbitant financial and procedural costs on the residents.

Property taxes and rents will rise and longtime homeowners will leave Pilsen, furthering the displacement and destruction of the cherished community. The demolition-free zone, on the other hand, protects the buildings of Pilsen without burdening the residents. Of further concern is this style of top-down city planning in which the mayor's office blatantly ignores communities and their representatives.

Despite continued community opposition to the Landmark ordinance, the mayor and Commissioner Cox continue to pursue it. It was their intention to sneak it into law by preventing a vote, and had the Pilsen community not demonstrated, signed petitions, collected affidavits, this meeting today might not have been scheduled at all. This is an issue that affects all wards, not just the 25th.

A yes vote on the Landmark ordinance tells City Hall that they can do what they want to your wards. It tells them that you are willing to sit back as the mayor ignores communities and their representatives. Do not set a precedent that the mayor can go above and all the person's head and therefore deny a community their right to self-determination.

Vote no on the Landmark ordinance to show City Hall that you listen to community's concerns. Vote yes for the demolition-free zone to prove that you listen to community solutions. Finally, I just want to mention that one week ago, City Council voted to approve the 2021 property tax increase.

I know that there are members of this committee who voted no on the tax increase, and I know that there are members who voted yes. The Landmark ordinance will effectively be a second property tax increase on Pilsen. To those of you who voted no on the tax increase, remain consistent with your stance one week ago.

Do not pass an ordinance which would raise taxes on a working community again. To those of you who voted yes, many of you explained your yes votes by asserting that though no one wants property tax increases, the 2021 budget measure was necessary. The Landmark is an unnecessary tax increase on the Pilsen community.

Vote no on the Landmark ordinance to show that the hard decision of last week was not in bad faith. Choose to not raise taxes when you have the opportunity. The 25th Ward Independent Political Organization is proud to be a member of the Stop the Pilsen Landmark Coalition, and we urge you to vote no on the Landmark ordinance and instead support Alderman Sig Cho-Lopez and the community's alternative.

Vote yes on the demolition-free zone ordinance. Thank you. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (46:21 - 46:42)
And our final speaker is Aliyah Higarita. I hope I got that halfway right. Hello, Aliyah or Aliyah?

[Speaker 25] (46:48 - 46:52)
Aliyah, you're unmuted and you can start speaking.

[Speaker 1] (47:03 - 48:34)
How about it? One last chance, Aliyah. You're unmuted.

Hopefully you can hear us. Okay. I don't think we're going to hear from that person.

So, all right. Thank you, everyone, for participating in the public comment period. And this concludes that portion of the meeting.

So now we'll be moving on to the addendum to the agenda. On the addendum, we have two demolitions in a historic landmark district. They are document number OR2020-308 in the 46th Ward for demolition of a non-contributing building at 4601 through 4611 North Broadway in the uptown square district.

And then, since it's adjacent to it, we'll hear them at the same time. Document number OR2020-309, again, in the 46th Ward for the demolition of a non-contributing building at 4613 through 4617 North Broadway, also in the uptown district. I believe on the surface it looks like the same building, but they're actually two buildings.

We have Michelle Rimes of the Department of Planning and Development to speak on both of these items. Michelle.

[Speaker 54] (48:45 - 50:17)
Good morning, Mr. Speaker. Pardon me, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Michelle Rimes.

I'm one of the historic preservation staff. I bring before you today two agenda items. The properties are owned by uptown 4601 owner LLC, which is a limited liability company.

This owner owns both of the ground level buildings. They brought the project before the commission on Chicago Landmarks on September 3rd and the permit review committee. Their goal is to demolish the building early 2021 with a goal of constructing a multi-story mixed-use building, which was vetted by the commission on Chicago Landmarks, November 5th of this year.

We have no objections to this. Both of the structures, the one at 4601 to 4611 North Broadway and the adjacent building at 4613 through 4617 North Broadway are considered non-conforming buildings in the uptown square landmark district. We have no objections to the demolition and seek your approval for both actions.

[Speaker 40] (50:30 - 50:34)
Okay. I don't know if I'll let me check.

[Speaker 1] (50:34 - 50:38)
Do we want to hear a Alderman Kappelman? Would you like to speak on this?

[Speaker 17] (50:39 - 51:12)
Sure. This is a project that my 46 ward zoning development committee supported five years ago. And so the demolition allows this project to actually come about.

There's been many starts and stops that have delayed this project, but it's something that I support because my zoning development committee made up of 30 different organizations voted in support of it. So I ask for the community support as well. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (51:13 - 51:23)
Okay. Any questions from committee members? Hearing none.

Can I get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

[Speaker 18] (51:25 - 51:31)
So move madam chair. I mean, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.

Chairman Dow.

[Speaker 1] (51:33 - 51:38)
Alderman Dow moves to pass any objections. Hearing none.

[Speaker 53] (51:39 - 51:39)
Objection.

[Speaker 15] (51:39 - 51:43)
Mr. Mr. Chairman, no objections. Could you add me to the roll, please? I apologize.

[Speaker 1] (51:43 - 52:48)
Thank you. Gil, you're added to the roll. And two items are, are, are passed.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Okay. Thank you, Michelle.

All right. Now we'll take up document number. Zero to zero to zero dash three, five, seven, seven.

A text amendment of the municipal code section 16 dash eight dash zero seven zero to further regulate rezonings in conversion areas. Before we get to the testimony, the item has a substitute. Do I hear a motion to accept the substitute?

So move. Alderman Rodriguez. Alderman Rodriguez motions to accept the substitute.

All in favor. Say aye. Aye.

Aye. Aye. Opposed.

Any opposed. Hearing none. The substitute is accepted.

Uh, we have the ordinances sponsor Alderman Villegas and zoning administrator, Patrick Murphy here to testify on the matter. Chairman Villegas.

[Speaker 15] (52:48 - 56:05)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Um, regarding this character building ordinance, it's not the first time this piece of legislation has been with the committee on zoning in April, 2019 DPD originally advanced this ordinance and it was introduced that committee. It was left following the administrative administration's turnover in may of 2019.

Recently after introduction, there have been since discussions with DPD to amend the originally drafted version to reflect broader considerations for the South and West sides. Stemming from a notice issue in North branch framework, any property that wanted a zoning change must pay an impact fee with the desire to preserve, preserve historic buildings and imagine mechanisms, which will alternate uses could provide for practical pursuit. These, these fees have had the unintended unintended consequences of being a death sentence for historic industrial properties, but a two to three story historic property cannot afford its potential far of say 50 stories and fees under the current ordinance, one story historic property will pay the same impact fee as a 50 story high rise.

Potential consequence of this reality will be the destruction of few remaining historic properties throughout the city. The projects either die or demolished for another high rise. And until then they remain vacant, non-economic engines.

This ordinance encourages the use of historic qualifying buildings by neutralizing the fees that would otherwise be imposed based on the maximum density. The site could allow for currently there's there does exist president for historic property, convergent to office use and a carve out where impact fee is required. This ordinance now address and encourage other economic and commercially viable space uses, for example, including a concert venue and other retail service type uses restaurant, fitness, et cetera, from a policy policy perspective, waiving a fee for office use in an effort to save historic building site would allow would follow consistently consistently if done.

So for a theater or independent concert venue or for a local organic grocery store, this ordinance corrects this like any ordinance regarding development, the concern and consideration must address potentials for abuse. And this ordinance impact fee is only way for the historic building footprint is not expanded. There could be no increase to the building height and the building coverage may only expand by 10%.

There are additional protections capping floor area, racial considerations whereby the excess would trigger fee to be added back on as chair for economic development. This is a promising ordinance, which intends to imagine more creative and unique development engines that will further highlight Chicago as a world-class city for architecture, hospitality, entertainment, to name a few upon repurposed historic sites. If feasible remains consistent as best interest of the city to encourage developers to save historic properties and put them to productive use for job creation and taxable revenue generation.

The issue of the impact fee that has currently effect in effect, strongly discouraged protection, a certain qualifying historic buildings subject to March, much larger floor area maximization and thus an automatic and considerable impact fee. So this ordinance in essence is an economic development tool that will allow for preservation of existing structures and the character that makes up the great city of Chicago. So I asked for your favorable consideration.

Once you've heard from Mr. Murphy.

[Speaker 1] (56:06 - 56:11)
Thank you, chairman Patrick, Patrick Murphy.

[Speaker 6] (56:13 - 56:21)
Yes. Hi chairman. Good morning.

Would you like me to go through any particular testimony or do you want me to answer any questions that committee members may have?

[Speaker 1] (56:23 - 56:32)
Well, you heard the summary from Alderman Vegas. Is there anything you wanted to highlight or, or opine on?

[Speaker 6] (56:33 - 56:49)
No, not necessarily, but I would be happy to go through there are about seven different elements to the ordinance that, that have impacts on declared character buildings. And so I'd be happy to walk through those or else, you know, answer questions of Alderman had them about a particular.

[Speaker 1] (56:51 - 56:54)
Can you do the seven characteristics in two minutes?

[Speaker 13] (56:57 - 56:58)
Sure. All right.

[Speaker 6] (56:59 - 58:20)
Okay. So the first thing that the project has to be reviewed through a type one or a plan development, meaning it comes back through city council for a vote, both by committee and the full council. Two, there are restrictions on the increases to the building height and supplementary supplementary to that.

There are restrictions on the increases to the building footprint. And the gist of that is we're dealing with buildings that are character buildings. There is a specific form to that building.

There's a certain bulk and mass to that building in order to take advantage of this reduction. Then you cannot be in a position to overly increase the size of those buildings, nor their footprint. The fourth point is you cannot overly increase the floor area that is there in the building.

So you want, you are, you are foregoing as the Alderman said, the ability to take advantage of certain bonuses. And therefore you are restricted in the size of the building and you have to maintain the floor area that is required in order to preserve the buildings that are the character buildings, which you are taking advantage of through this ordinance. The next thing you can utilize TSL reduction.

So there can be parking reductions that are provided through this property, through the TSL. And lastly, it has to become an unofficial landmark as designated by the city council.

[Speaker 1] (58:21 - 58:37)
Thank you, Patrick. And thank you for staying within your timeframe. All right.

Questions from committee members. I see a few, so we'll start with Alderman Ray Lopez Raymond.

[Speaker 37] (58:39 - 59:03)
Thank you, chairman and good morning colleagues. Forgive me. I'm on the road during this meeting, Patrick, I did have a question.

Is there a reason, or maybe chairman Vegas, is there a reason why this would have to be considered a landmark for properties to be considered characteristic of a community? Or was there any thought to maybe being able to do this without the landmark designation?

[Speaker 6] (59:05 - 1:00:07)
Alderman, would you like me to respond or do you want to answer Alderman Vegas? I'm sorry. Yeah, if you could respond to that, please.

Sure. So Alderman Lopez, the premise of the ordinance is that we started with only the buildings that are designated as character buildings. Sorry, my camera's frozen.

We started with the buildings that are character buildings as designated in the overlays for both Kinsey and North branch from there. If we're going to attribute a, an exemption from a fee, we wanted to make sure that the character, which these buildings represent, which was identified in the plans that established these overlays is maintained for the benefit of the city and these communities. We didn't want to put ourselves in a position of allowing for this exemption to take place, but not holding the building to the standard of being maintained.

And so this is an additional assurance that in exchange for being relaxed of a fee, they will be able to with the city we'll have the preservation of this building maintained. Okay.

[Speaker 37] (1:00:08 - 1:00:39)
My, my only concern is that, you know, oftentimes the landmarking as we've heard through a number of testimonies creates a, a, a burden on owners. And in certain areas, we don't even have the landmark district in place, but we do have plenty of buildings that fit a certain character that we're trying to maintain. So I just hope that as this proceeds, that we can possibly revisit this and we're looking to expand it further to be more beneficial without being as burdensome, regardless of the fees that are being reduced.

Thank you, chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:00:40 - 1:00:43)
Thank you. Alderman, Alderman Scott Waguespack.

[Speaker 25] (1:00:43 - 1:00:53)
Thanks chairman. Is there any fiscal impact here? Yes.

Calculated. Sorry. Sure.

[Speaker 1] (1:00:53 - 1:00:58)
I'm sorry. Since you're the economic development guru, you should talk about that.

[Speaker 29] (1:00:59 - 1:00:59)
Yeah.

[Speaker 15] (1:00:59 - 1:01:59)
Well here, what Alderman Waguespack, what prompted the ordinance was the fact that there was a project that had been put in a position where it would have been had, it would have had to have been torn down in order to make economic sense for the developer. What this, what this does. So the question is yes and no, because if a project's not being developed, there isn't, there isn't any type of economic activity occurring.

It just, it's just sitting there on the road, not losing, losing all types of all like all types of the ability to collect taxes based off the new use. So what this does is allow for, for the department of department of planning, as well as Mr. Murphy to take a look at having economic development at the forefront when we're trying to get as much, as much development as possible in the city done in a, in a timely fashion.

[Speaker 16] (1:02:01 - 1:02:09)
So the impact's more positive on the development side of it than, than it is to the more minimal fees you might get.

[Speaker 26] (1:02:09 - 1:02:10)
Correct.

[Speaker 16] (1:02:10 - 1:02:13)
Okay. Great. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:02:13 - 1:02:16)
Alderman Brian Hopkins, Brian.

[Speaker 4] (1:02:18 - 1:03:04)
Yeah. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just on 0.7 of Mr. Murphy's testimony regarding the character buildings becoming landmarks, unless I'm wrong, none of the existing character buildings in the north branch have ever been formally reviewed for landmark status, but just sort of a casual discussion suggests that, you know, the case may not be quite so obvious, which is why no one's ever sought landmark status for them. Has there been any sort of preliminary review on how this might impact them? That if they, if they seek to change their status under these rules, you seem to suggest at the end that they would have to become official landmarks. Is that correct?

Yes. Alderman. Thank you.

This is Patrick Murphy.

[Speaker 6] (1:03:04 - 1:03:38)
Again, we did start the review on this particular property to determine that it was eligible for landmark status. And we have been, we have been at this for a number of months with the property owner. So, so we did make that a specific additional caveat, like I was saying to Alderman Lopez or in response, Alderman Lopez, so that we would have a greater benefit to the city of having maintained these properties.

But yes, we've already started down this road with the Morton salt buildings and looking at other buildings as well in the, in the area to make sure that it is a possibility.

[Speaker 8] (1:03:39 - 1:03:40)
Okay.

[Speaker 4] (1:03:40 - 1:04:00)
Very good. And then there's no issues with sort of changing the rules in the middle of the game here for the existing designations of character buildings that we're okay going forward with this based on the assumption that it's a choice. If you want to avoid the fee.

And if you don't, you can just operate under the old rules.

[Speaker 6] (1:04:01 - 1:04:05)
Correct. It is a choice. It's not a mandatory requirement for any of these buildings.

[Speaker 4] (1:04:07 - 1:04:11)
All right. Thank you, Mr. Murphy. No, no further questions, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Brian.

[Speaker 5] (1:04:14 - 1:04:36)
Thank you, chairman. I'll be brief. I just want to make sure I fully understand this ordinance.

When we talk about conversion areas within industrial quarters, Does this include properties currently within PMDs? I'm thinking about the PMD as being preserved west of Ogden Avenue on the Kinsey industrial corridor.

[Speaker 6] (1:04:40 - 1:05:20)
So these. Yes, sir. So these two.

So, so there, so first of all, this impacts two specific overlays, one being the North branch. And the other one, as you said is the Kinsey. And then specific to those, It impacts two specific lists of properties, which are in both of those corridors.

I would have to double check to see if the Kinsey character buildings, if any extend into the, no, I'm sorry. They would not because this, this is limited to the areas that converted from PMD. So no, the character buildings in question specific to Kinsey are east of Ogden.

[Speaker 5] (1:05:21 - 1:05:23)
That is all I needed to know, sir. Thank you so much.

[Speaker 1] (1:05:25 - 1:05:27)
Alderman, Alderman Patel.

[Speaker 18] (1:05:28 - 1:06:00)
Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Patrick or, or Alderman Villegas. In your presentation, you talked about the impact that this would have in helping West and South side communities.

But it appears that this ordinance is very, basically focused on two North side. Areas. And my accurate in hearing that.

And then two, how would this impact a typical community on the South side?

[Speaker 6] (1:06:02 - 1:06:53)
Alderman Villegas, would you like me to respond? Yes, please. So Alderman Dow, the, the reason that it only impacts the near North side and the near West side.

Corridors is because those are the only two to this point, which have come back through council and had official character buildings and overlays designated in them. So as the department looks at other industrial corridors and possible revisions to other PMDs throughout the city, whether they be on the South or West side, this same opportunity could be made in those districts. If character buildings, which are not yet landmarks are identified.

So it would be a, it would be a matter of future analysis of these industrial areas and what the, and then extending this extending this clause to those, those specific corridors and character buildings that might be contained in them.

[Speaker 18] (1:06:53 - 1:07:19)
Okay. So for a, these new character district overlay district that you're looking at in places like Inglewood and Bronzeville, for example, if there were buildings within those districts that might fit an industrial, have an industrial nature or quality quality to them, Those might be able to participate in this particular program.

[Speaker 6] (1:07:21 - 1:08:29)
No, not quite. So the buildings, the buildings, first of all, would have to be in an area that were formally PMD or currently in a PMD and by, and then also in an industrial corridor and are converting out of the PMD zoning. So what we did, for instance, in North branch and Kinsey, is those properties that had a PMD designation were reverted back to their pre PMD zoning district.

In nearly all cases, it was some variation of an M or a D S as in Sam downtown service district. Then for an individual to redevelop that property for a non manufacturing or industrial purpose, they would need to rezone to a B or a C district presumably, or, or a DX district. That's when the fee would take place.

That that chronology does not apply in areas outside of PMD zoning. So for the areas in Inglewood, like you mentioned, and other areas that we're looking at a different type of overlay, those, even if the buildings have an industrial nature, even if they have an M zoning, they would not qualify under this designation because they were not formally PMD.

[Speaker 18] (1:08:29 - 1:08:33)
Okay. That's clear. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:08:35 - 1:11:02)
Okay. Thank you. Committee members.

Any further questions? Questions from committee members, non committee members. So hearing none, do I get a motion to pass this item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

So move Mr. Chairman. That was Alderman Hopkins moves to pass any objections hearing on the item is passed as amended. All right.

Thank you. Congratulations. Chairman Vegas.

All right. So next we'll move on to the historical landmark designation document number. Oh two Oh one nine dash three eight one five in the 25th ward for the historical landmark designation for the Pilsen historic district, primarily West 18th street from South Leavitt street to Sangamon street and residential blocks founded by West 18th street, South Ashland, West 21st and South Racine Avenue.

Before I ask for the department of planning, I do want to, I do want to map out how we're going to address this issue. Obviously this issue that come up in July, I believe we spent a lot of time on it. We heard from a lot of speakers.

So what I meant going in with that in mind, and I know there's plenty of packet information, right? Nicole, it's been sent both for and against I'm going to ask the city's department of planning to present for a total at no more than 15 minutes. And then since this item is in the 25th ward we will have Alderman Ciccio Lopez have 15 minutes to present his views of him and the committee, the community, I should say.

And then we will open it up for committee members to ask questions on the landmark ordinance. And similar to the budget procedures, we'll limit the question at least round one to no more than five minutes per committee member. Sounds like a plan.

All right. Okay. So I think, correct me if I'm wrong, is it Deanna Cavallo?

Who's going to be speaking first from the department of planning landmarks division. Deanna.

[Speaker 7] (1:11:03 - 1:11:07)
Thank you, chairman Tunney and members of the committee. I hope you can see my presentation.

[Speaker 1] (1:11:08 - 1:11:09)
Yes, we can.

[Speaker 7] (1:11:09 - 1:15:33)
Thank you. My name is Deanna Cavallo and I'm with the department of planning and developments, historic preservation division, which serves as staff to the commission on Chicago landmarks. I'm here today to present the landmarks commission's recommendation to designate the Pilsen district as an official landmark district within the city of Chicago.

The proposed landmark district in Pilsen includes a dense and varied collection of historic buildings built by Bohemian immigrants in the late 19th century and preserved and enriched by Mexican immigrants in this century. This is one of the first to recognize the multicultural importance of a Chicago neighborhood with the intent to preserve not a single point in time, but the cultural heritage of the immigrant communities who shaped it. The proposed district is the first that recognizes the contributions and culture of Chicago's Latinx community, and it is the first to incorporate murals and architecture as a layered historic resource.

The district boundaries include 14 blocks along the 18th street commercial quarter, generally between South Leavitt and Sangamon streets and 13 blocks of primarily residential structures south of 18th street. The proposed Pilsen historic district has two periods of significance, one for buildings and one for murals. For buildings, the period starts in the 1870s when the oldest buildings in the district are believed to have been constructed through 1969 to ensure that architectural contributions made by Mexican immigrants are evaluated as significant.

The period for the murals begins in 1978, the date of the oldest mural within the district boundary. No specific end date for the period of significance is identified in recognition of the ongoing evolution of this art form in Pilsen. On May 16, 2019, the commission on Chicago landmarks found that the Pilsen district meets the following four criteria for landmark designation.

Under criterion one for heritage, the district contributes to the city's social and cultural history as it has been a port of entry for immigrants from Europe in the late 19th century and Mexico in the mid 20th century. In criterion six for architecture, the district's distinctive architecture includes a wide variety of structures built between 1870 and 1969. Under criterion six for the distinctive themes, it conveys as a district in that all of the buildings in the district work together to narrate important aspects of the city's history and culture.

And finally, it meets criterion seven as the many murals in the district depict themes from Mexican history and culture, which lend the district a distinct visual presence. I would also like to provide a quick overview of the timeline of the proposed district, which has been in effect on a pending basis since December 8, 2018, when it received a preliminary recommendation from the commission on Chicago landmarks. Two months later, three demolition application permits were received for contributing buildings on 18th street, which accelerated the typical timeline for a final recommendation to city council.

That final recommendation was sent to city council in May of 2019. In April, 2020, a tolling extension effective from March 18th through June 30th was approved by city council due to the pandemic. And in July, this committee approved an extension through January 31st, 2021 for a final vote to enable more community outreach.

At this point, I would like to invite commissioner Cox to discuss what has occurred since July. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:15:33 - 1:15:36)
Thank you, Deanna. Commissioner.

[Speaker 10] (1:15:37 - 1:17:49)
Good morning. And thank you for the opportunity to speak today. I'd like to briefly address the three informational meetings that were conducted in October by the planning department held subsequent to your, your committee, six month extension.

Granted. While the intention of these meetings were to help mitigate property owners' concerns about the potential obligations of being a property owner in a landmark district, the information we provided was simply not well received. We heard from a very robust portion of the community that the district designation was not perceived to be in their best interest.

The planning department concluded the meetings fully aware of the well organized opposition to the proposed designation. But obviously this recommendation precedes me as Alderman. It precedes me as commissioner.

It precedes the Alderman, Ciccio Lopez and precedes the mayor. And we recognize that in this new era that we are committed to characterized by deep community engagement in that context, it matters how residents and communities are able to shape their community. And the voices of stakeholders are paramount in this new era.

So that said, I acknowledged to the participants in our October meetings that I would relay their sentiment for a no vote to the committee on zoning landmarks and building standards. So at this point, the decision really is in the capable hands of this committee. And I stand able and willing to answer any questions that you may have.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:17:50 - 1:18:08)
Thank you, commissioner. Thank you, Deanna. I know how much work has been put in by the department and I appreciate your testimony.

Now we're going to hear from the Alderman Ciccio Lopez. Alderman Lopez Ciccio.

[Speaker 2] (1:18:11 - 1:30:44)
I would like to thank the chairmen. First. The residents of the Pilsen community that came.

This morning to testify. In this important matter. For our community.

This is a pivotal moment for communities like Pilsen. This is a community. As you all well know.

That has been hurt. for decades for the lack of accountability, the corruption, but more important than anything else, the lack of inclusion in the decision-making process that affects many immigrant families, many immigrant residents, seniors, vulnerable residents, Latino immigrant residents in a big part of the world that are right now hurt. A lot of essential workers, a lot of our essential workers who today are struggling and have taken the time to attend meetings for almost two years.

Of course we want to consider every single tool available to us to address the number one issue that we have in our community, which is displacement. Over the last 18 years we have seen what corruption has done to our community. We have seen an increase of almost 500% in the property tax assessments of our residents.

500%. Corruption, my has dire consequences in our communities. We have heard for a very small sample of residents that came to speak to you today in hopes that this committee will listen to our residents, our most vulnerable, most vulnerable residents.

Immigrant residents like myself who have come to communities like Pilsen to make Pilsen their homes. We hear from small businesses who have made their home for decades. Family seniors who with sweat and tears have built their homes brick by brick.

We heard in community meetings like Commissioner Cox has said, we actually redo the process. We did it twice. That's how committed we are to a community driven process that listens to the concerns of our residents.

We did it twice just so that there's no doubt. As a result of this process over the last few months we have doubled the number of affidavits, signed affidavits from homeowners in the district that do not think that this is the path forward. I've been elected with a great responsibility and I take this very seriously to find a new route for our community who is struggling.

14,000 Latino residents, 14,000 have been displaced in the last 18 years as a result of exclusion, corruption and the lack of self-determination of a community that is resilient and fights and wants to be part of the conversation and that's exactly what we're providing today. We have not only almost 500 affidavits who are not only opposing the landmark but asking for solutions to this committee. They're asking for solutions that we are developing with them.

We have done not only three meetings over the last few months with Commissioner Cox, we have done over two years at least six public meetings, focus groups. We created an atmosphere where people can believe again that there is a way to address their issues. We have a path forward.

Gentrification is not inevitable my colleagues. We can and we should provide solutions to our residents. We have the support of every single neighborhood group in our community that has participated actively in these conversations, who are concerned about what's happening with 78.

Let's remember my colleagues that we have a huge mega development that was approved last minute and pushed just as this landmark almost got pushed in the last minute and thanks to the community participation we force a conversation and we are here today asking you not only to work with us to oppose a landmark that 95% of my constituents oppose and every single neighborhood organization and the support including of public officials including Congressman Garcia who has said that this is not the route. We have worked tirelessly with our housing department.

We have a deconversion ordinance who is ready to go. We have working with the ARO pilot conversations. We have a revamp ideas of reviving revamping the ARO pilot for Pilsen Little Village.

We have ideas. We have ordinances ready to go. What we need is time my colleagues and I tell you that you know when a community so vulnerable like Pilsen, so unique, so unique that in our community we feel responsible to provide solutions.

We are called to provide a solution for a thriving beautiful unique community. I hear from the presentations of DPD many times how they honor immigrant residents, working class residents, essential workers. Well let's do it with action my colleagues.

Let's do it with action. Let's do it with policy and the policy that we move forward has a real clear plan. Landmarkings only protect buildings and as you hear from here we may hear from the support of a few organizations outside the district and contractors and developers who are not only opposed you know to and not only are supporting this landmark we're supporting the landmark before my time but they're opposing a demolition freeze that has support in the community.

That has the support and we can work with legal on this. We can work with legal and buildings and many other departments to make this a different reality for residents. There is a path forward but we need to make sure that we start by listening to our constituents or residents.

This is an opportunity that we have to change a horrible legacy. It pains me to see residents, neighbors that day in day out come to our office. They're struggling with property taxes.

They're struggling to pay their bills as small business owners or people who in the last few months have said I can no longer stay in a place that I call home. You understand the traumatic experience for a community who has built was being intrinsic part of our community that now has to be displaced because supposedly there is no remedy. My colleagues there are remedies out there.

There are policies that we're putting forward. What I'm asking you today is to listen to my constituents. Almost 500 constituents who have participated actively.

That's more than 50% of the landmark designation district of 950 properties because there are several who own more than one property. Overwhelmingly long-term residents, new residents, small businesses, everybody has said no to the landmark but yes to a different route. A people-to-moment within the city of Chicago for once we can give self-determination to our residents, to our communities, across the districts, across the works.

If indeed this is a new era, if this is indeed a new era, then we ought to be listening to our testimonies. People who came and said we need a different plan. We need a different route.

We cannot allow, we cannot allow the destruction of the Pilsen community. My colleagues, the vote that you have in front of you is the choice to support the status quo, to support the past, a corrupt administration where this was conceived, or support a new era indeed. An era when we listen to our constituents, when we listen to researchers.

We have and I hope that we're able to connect Professor Wynne Curran and Professor Betancourt. Two professors who have studied among them the Pilsen community and the gentrification process for almost two decades. We have a responsibility today to listen to the tools and the policies that are available.

Today we have a choice my colleagues. We have a choice to help and honor those immigrant communities who are hurting today more than ever. You heard them coming, testifying, begging for your support.

It pains me to see this, that should be given. Every community has the right for self-determination. We can agree to disagree, but one thing that we can all agree is that we must honor the right for self-determination of our community.

A community, like I said, who has been suffering for way too long. We have a choice today in front of us. A choice to leave behind the past, those bad decisions who have been in developers and realtors, and take that courageous act forward.

A courageous vote to help us address the issue of gentrification, the issue of displacement, the issue of extraordinary property taxes who have burdened my small businesses and my constituents for decades. The demolition freeze ordinance is an alternative, a viable, feasible alternative that we work with law since September so that we can present to you something that is feasible and is viable. It has the support of the buildings department.

We also have committed from my office a staffer to make sure that we don't burden some, any extra burden to the department. We have precedent on the demolition freeze ordinance that was introduced and passed for the 606. We're asking my colleagues today is the, for all we talk about honoring the immigrant working-class communities or essential workers, is that a special place that we all protect?

That we all protect. That's why I ask you today to please listen to the scholars, listen to the research, listen to the policies that we're having forward, move forward. The collaborative work with departments, but more than anything else, to please listen to the people of the Pilsen community.

Those vulnerable residents who are making our communities so special. Chicago is special and is resilient because of communities like Pilsen and the other beautiful neighborhoods that make our city. Today we present to you a viable plan to help us address this issue.

I beg you to listen to my constituents, to listen to the working-class people of Pilsen who work hard day to day, day in and day out. We need your support so that we protect them, so they can continue to call Pilsen their home. We have again a viable plan.

I ask you to please vote no for the landmark and to please support us on a demolition freeze that has precedent. And we've been working hard for months to give you a feasible plan that is not only opposing the landmark, but give you a viable choice, a viable solution to address these issues. In six months we have a plan that I'm confident will help us address some of the issues in our community.

But we do need those six months and this has legal standing. Thank you again for your attention. I don't know, Chairman, if Professor Curran and Professor Vettenko are available, if anybody has questions, or can add a few more minutes to my presentation.

Thank you again.

[Speaker 1] (1:30:45 - 1:30:53)
Alderman, we have two minutes and 27 seconds. Would one of the two witnesses would like to speak, or are you going, because that's your time allotted?

[Speaker 2] (1:30:54 - 1:30:57)
Yeah, I think Professor Curran, I think, is on the line.

[Speaker 1] (1:30:57 - 1:31:09)
Okay, shall we hear from Professor Curran, or John? John, whoever you are.

[Speaker 30] (1:31:09 - 1:31:12)
Sorry, my internet cut out, just as I think you may have called my name.

[Speaker 1] (1:31:12 - 1:31:14)
Okay, now who is this, for the record, please?

[Speaker 30] (1:31:15 - 1:31:28)
My name is Winifred Curran. I am a professor and chair of the Department of Geography at DePaul University, and I've been doing research on gentrification for over 20 years, and I've been working in Tilson now for 16 years.

[Speaker 1] (1:31:29 - 1:31:33)
I establish your credentials, but we have one minute and 42 seconds.

[Speaker 30] (1:31:33 - 1:32:22)
Okay, so basically what I just want to say is that, well, preservation in and of itself is not a bad idea. It is a bad idea in this instance, because preservation designation can just add fuel to the fire of gentrification in Tilson that we know is already happening, and has been happening for a good 20 years. So that landmarking is not the policy to pause gentrification, but there are other policies that could.

That's where we need to put our effort. The demolition freeze allows for that. It gives us time to come up with other policies, and also time to implement other policies that are already in the works, like the deconversion ordinance that the alderman mentioned, and so that's where the efforts of planning and housing should be, not on this landmarking, but on allowing for a demolition freeze and looking for other alternatives, because there are policies that can slow gentrification. It's just that this one isn't it.

[Speaker 1] (1:32:24 - 1:32:31)
Thank you, Winifred. I guess that's the other person we haven't been able to find, right, Curran?

[Speaker 30] (1:32:32 - 1:32:33)
No, I'm Winifred Curran.

[Speaker 1] (1:32:33 - 1:32:35)
Oh, I'm sorry, Winifred, I'm sorry.

[Speaker 30] (1:32:36 - 1:32:40)
John Betancourt, I believe, was also on the line at one point anyway.

[Speaker 1] (1:32:42 - 1:32:54)
Yes, I am. All right, well, let's open it up for questions then from committee members, please. I see, let's see, first I see Mike Rodriguez.

Mike?

[Speaker 21] (1:32:55 - 1:35:25)
Thank you, Mr. Chair. You know, this is a very important issue, not just for the Pilsen community, but for communities around our city. You know, I represent the largely working class residents of the 22nd Ward, and we're just east of Pilsen, and much of my ward, about two-thirds of my ward is in the Little Village community.

And, you know, we, and particularly in my part of the 22nd Ward in Little Village, aren't seeing the devastating effects of gentrification that we've seen from our brothers and sisters in Pilsen, but we are very aware and very cognizant of what the future might look like for communities like ours. And we're looking to what's happening in the 25th Ward and in Pilsen and other areas to figure out how to get ahead of these curves, to make sure that we're preserving our communities and offering development efforts that don't lead to displacement. That's extremely important.

What's extremely important to me is looking at this effort is to really understand what the community feels and what the community sees here. And it strikes me as this landmark district, in this instance, is square peg and round hole. It strikes me as though the residents, the community organizations, in near unanimity have stated that they are against this designation.

I'm not sure why this is even being discussed at this point. It strikes me as though that the local community is in opposition, the local political leaders from the aldermen up to the congressmen are in opposition. And to be quite frank, I'd like to read a brief statement from my ward organization that is in agreement with this effort.

The 22nd Ward IPO believes that the residents of the 25th Ward should have the right to determine what ordinance shall be enacted in their ward. Pilsen residents have been fighting for decades to deter gentrification and to protect homeowners and renters from rising costs. We stand with our Pilsen neighbors to support, to be against the landmark and support the temporary demolition moratorium for the Pilsen Historic District and call on the city to respect the demands of local residents.

So I just like to state that I support the efforts of my colleague. I do have two questions. One for Professor Bentancur, who I believe is on the line.

[Speaker 10] (1:35:25 - 1:35:26)
Yes.

[Speaker 21] (1:35:27 - 1:35:47)
Professor, I've read much of your work and I really respect a lot of it. I do want to raise some things that I have read in your work around the designation of landmark districts and the detrimental effects that they might have on communities like Pilsen. And I'm just curious if you would add anything to the conversation that hasn't already been stated.

[Speaker 23] (1:35:51 - 1:35:57)
Definitely. I'm sorry that a lot of this conversation is...

[Speaker 1] (1:35:57 - 1:35:59)
Professor, would you identify yourself for the record, sir?

[Speaker 23] (1:36:00 - 1:36:08)
My name is John Bentancur. I hold the rank of professor at the University of Illinois Department of Urban Planning and Policy.

[Speaker 1] (1:36:09 - 1:36:16)
Before you start, we have a minute and 48 seconds on this round. So if you could be brief, answering the Alderman's question.

[Speaker 23] (1:36:17 - 1:37:27)
Yes, I have a prepared testimony, but I will pass it on. Basically, I would say that most of the support evidence brought to this hearing does not coincide with the facts. Every research piece in the country about designations has demonstrated that they increase property values, increase taxes, and displace residents.

So it's quite malicious to say otherwise on the part of institutions in Chicago that should work on the basis of the facts. As far as the ordinance, I think that it should be rejected, not necessarily because of its spirit, but because of the way in which it is approaching this, rather than going against the community. I think the city should start partnering with communities, and this is critical.

Pilsen and no community in Chicago has had that benefit. This is a new city council, a new administration.

[Speaker 1] (1:37:29 - 1:37:35)
Let's make it a new day. Thank you, Professor. Michael, you had a second question?

[Speaker 21] (1:37:36 - 1:38:05)
Yeah, Chairman, is that 20 seconds for Mr. Betancourt, or is that my question? That's your total time on round one. Good thing.

So I'll end with the following. I'm just curious if Commissioner Cox essentially stated that a DPD is pulling their support for this endeavor, given what he said about the community support. And then lastly, I'd say we need to continue to listen to our residents and community organizations that are digging deep, plugging deep on these issues.

And in this issue, particularly, I think they're loud and clear.

[Speaker 1] (1:38:06 - 1:38:11)
Thank you. Commissioner Cox, I think just quickly, would you answer the Alderman's question?

[Speaker 10] (1:38:11 - 1:38:40)
Certainly. My role here was to bring the recommendation from the Landmarks Commission to this committee. And that was captured in Deanna's presentation.

What I committed to the participants in the town hall information meeting is that I would convey their sentiment for a no vote to the committee.

[Speaker 1] (1:38:40 - 1:38:42)
How about a quick answer to the Alderman, okay?

[Speaker 10] (1:38:44 - 1:38:48)
I have conveyed what I heard to the committee for your deliberation.

[Speaker 1] (1:38:49 - 1:40:21)
Yeah, which is withdrawing your support. Michael, I think that answers your question, correct? Thank you, Chairman.

Okay. I don't see other hands, but I myself have a couple of questions. I've spent a lot of time on this working with the Alderman and the department.

And just for the clarification, as we move into the second ordinance, I wanted to bring Deanna back on a couple of issues, since she's our landmark chief over here. Deanna, I wanted to ask you first, in your timeline, somebody needs to unmute. Okay.

Deanna, in your timeline sheet on your PowerPoint, the preliminary designation that was introduced, can you make sure that you go through the line and to make sure that our committee members know that upon the preliminary designation, that there is a demo delay. And my understanding, that demo delay has been in effect for about 22 months. So that's my first question, to bring that up to the committee members' attention.

And then secondly, I don't think it was mentioned in any of the testimony that the entire proposal for landmark recommendation included about a thousand properties, a mix of commercial and residential. So could you answer both of those questions? I already know the answers, but would you make sure that our committee members know it?

[Speaker 7] (1:40:22 - 1:41:46)
Thank you, Chairman Taney. So, correct. When the commission voted preliminary landmark recommendation in December of 2018, at that point, the code requires that we review the permit applications for that boundary from that point forward until the final decision is made by city council on the district designation.

So that has been the timeline. So that review started from 2018, and that meant that any proposed demolition permit applications for demolitions have been under the commission review. And effectively, the commission has seen multiple applications for demolitions, has denied multiple applications, and only one was approved because it was deemed imminently dangerous and hazardous by the department of buildings.

So the properties, we had estimated about close to 900 parcels, a little bit more in pins, and every property owner. So somewhere in 930 range of individual pins were identified, and each property owner had received various notifications throughout this process.

[Speaker 1] (1:41:46 - 1:42:18)
And then, since I have been a collaborator with the department on landmarks in my community, as most of our committee members have, talk to me about the effect. In many cases, landmarks are approved without substantial support from the property owners and our community. Historically, that's not always been a guarantor of the landmarking.

Is that correct?

[Speaker 7] (1:42:19 - 1:43:25)
So the landmarking is seen as a city benefit, and the landmark designation means that the area or an individual property is recognized as meeting criteria and significant to Chicago for various reasons. And the requirement in the code is that, obviously, we go through the process, we notify the property owners, we ask for consent, but the consent is not required in order for the commission to make a final recommendation or city council to act on that designation. If there is opposition to that, there is a public hearing process that is also part of the designation process through the commission, and that has occurred in this instance.

The only properties per code that cannot be designated without owner consent are religious properties that are used for religious purposes at the time of that process designation.

[Speaker 1] (1:43:25 - 1:43:30)
Okay, thank you. I see a couple more hands up. Alderman Kappelman?

[Speaker 17] (1:43:30 - 1:45:06)
Thank you, Chair. I'll start out with this. A number of years ago, I went to the Harvard Kennedy School of Government just to talk, and it was for elected around the world, and we talked about how to make a good decision.

And there are many elected to make decisions based on what the majority of their constituents want. And then there are elected to make decisions on what is most wise. And if what most elected want and what is most wise, if they come together, that's a good thing.

We're in this dilemma of what is wise, and it's clear, though, what most people want is not having this historic district. My concern, though, is that it's not clear to me that this decision was an informed one, because my understanding from listening to testimony was that people were adamantly opposed to this because they thought it would rapidly increase gentrification. So, and if I thought the same, I would also be opposed to it.

But it's not clear to me that is indeed the case. So I would like to hear from Commissioner Cox, what is your understanding, what are the experts saying about historic district? Does that increase gentrification?

Does it slow it down? Or does it have no effect?

[Speaker 10] (1:45:10 - 1:45:38)
Thank you, Chairman Tunney. I did invite an expert witness nationally, Donovan Repkama of Place Economics, who has studied the relationship of historic districts in minority communities, to speak. And if you might allow him to address that question, I think he could help our conversation.

[Speaker 1] (1:45:39 - 1:45:43)
Thank you, Commissioner. If we can get him on quickly, there's two minutes and 51 seconds.

[Speaker 10] (1:45:44 - 1:45:48)
I think he is on the call. Jamie Torres.

[Speaker 53] (1:45:49 - 1:45:54)
I am on the call. Mind crash.

[Speaker 1] (1:45:54 - 1:46:05)
Identify yourself. And the Commissioner has asked you to talk about landmarking and impact on gentrification, I believe is the best way to phrase it. Okay.

[Speaker 53] (1:46:05 - 1:47:44)
Yes. Thank you, sir. My name is Donovan Repkama.

I have a firm called Place Economics. And we are a quantitative research firm that looks at the impacts of historic presence. And in regard to that particular question, the most germane and recent analysis was one done by a research group in Los Angeles between UC Berkeley and UCLA.

And they looked at 15 years worth of data and identified the neighborhoods and mapped out the neighborhoods that were gentrified neighborhoods over that time. We recently did a study in Los Angeles on the impacts of historic preservation, came upon their work. And so what we did was overlaid their map of gentrifying areas in Los Angeles with the local historic districts in Los Angeles.

And what was interesting and counter to the kind of anecdotal stories about preservation causing gentrification, there was almost no connection. 90% of the areas that were identified as gentrifying neighborhoods were not historic districts at all. And 90% of the historic districts, there were not marked as a gentrifying areas.

In fact, there was a cluster of historic neighborhoods around these gentrifying neighborhoods that might even suggest that it's a deterrent to gentrification, that they were in regions of the city that were gentrifying, but the neighborhoods were not. So there's interesting information all around, but that's really the best, most recent on this specific issue of gentrification and historic districts. Thank you, sir.

[Speaker 17] (1:47:44 - 1:48:28)
Thank you. Alderman Kaplan. That's great.

I mean, my only other point is in the Uptown community has experienced a lot of gentrification and there's been some word that the Uptown Square District spurred that on. I can say that what really spurred it on was the Wilson L being completely rehabbed. It was a $200 million makeover.

And it happened at a time when a lot of people with huge college debt wanted to move into an area with good mass transit. And with the work that I did with the Cook County State's Attorney's Office and the police, crime dropped dramatically. And that's what really encouraged more people to move in, which made the rents go up.

But thank you, chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:48:29 - 1:48:32)
All right. Thank you. Alderman Pat Dowell.

[Speaker 17] (1:48:33 - 1:48:34)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 18] (1:48:34 - 1:49:33)
I just had a couple of questions based on what I was listening to today. I think, you know, landmarking generally from my perspective, my dog is acting. Toots.

From my perspective, you know, can preserve important character in the housing stock and buildings in a community and preserve history. And I was wondering if the commissioner could, but one concern I have is that it has a negative impact sometimes on existing homeowners who might have to spend more money to maintain the characteristics of that district, right? You have to put in certain types of windows.

You have to use certain specific building materials. And I'm wondering if you could speak to that commissioner and what impact that would have on this Pilsen designation.

[Speaker 10] (1:49:35 - 1:50:56)
Thank you. Thank you, Alderman Dowell. So the historic district regulates out exterior improvements only.

So it's, you know, your roof shingles, windows, doors, repointing bricks. All of these are costs that are generally what a homeowner would engage in doing improvements to exterior improvements to their property. These costs do not change if you're in a historic district or if you're in any other part of the city.

And in fact, the historic district can write guidelines and specifications that are commensurate with the income of that particular area. So Pilsen could write guidelines that would say vinyl windows are allowed, that shingles can be asphalt shingles. So each district can tailor to that specific issue.

[Speaker 18] (1:50:57 - 1:51:02)
And do you find that that's happening in other districts, established districts across Chicago?

[Speaker 10] (1:51:05 - 1:51:22)
I don't have an overview of other districts, but I know the Pilsen, where the Pilsen community is, and we would have to craft guidelines specific to that community. And we are able, willing and able to do that.

[Speaker 18] (1:51:23 - 1:51:49)
All right, thank you. One more question, Mr. Chairman, is that Dr. Curran is still on. She articulated in her remarks that there were strategies to curb gentrification.

I'm just curious, not that I don't want to treat these on it, but I just am curious to see what those things are. If she could just state them quickly.

[Speaker 30] (1:51:49 - 1:53:01)
Thank you for the question, Alderman. Yes. So one of the things that is already on the works is a deconversion ordinance in order to try to put a halt to the process of converting two flats into ginormous single family homes.

So that's one element. A demolition freeze would again be important in taking the time to decide what the proper policies would and should be. That's because so much air in the room has been taken up by the landmark district.

There hasn't really been a lot of focus on that. Other options are tax breaks for homeowners who keep their units, you know, landlords who keep their units affordable in small buildings. Other cities have enacted policies that if a landlord displaces a tenant, they have to pay for relocation costs.

So there's a whole tax on landlords who purposefully keep their units vacant in order to wait for higher income tenants to come in or a change in the market. Right now we're seeing that a lot during the pandemic, purposefully keeping units vacant. So there's a whole host of policies that could be in play.

We just need the political will to enact some of them.

[Speaker 18] (1:53:04 - 1:53:05)
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:53:06 - 1:53:26)
All right. And then Alderman La Spada. And then I think to close will be Alderman Siccio-Lopez.

Unless anyone puts their hand up in the next minute, we're going to hear from La Spada and then we're going to close with Siccio-Lopez. Daniel.

[Speaker 5] (1:53:26 - 1:53:45)
Thank you so much, Chairman. Commissioner Kirk, if I may ask, because I think we've been talking about this, but would you describe a historic landmark district as more than, you would describe it as like an aesthetic preservation tool, correct?

[Speaker 10] (1:53:48 - 1:54:00)
Not wholly. It is a tool to protect the buildings and the people who live in those buildings and the businesses that reside in those buildings.

[Speaker 5] (1:54:04 - 1:54:27)
I feel like the part that I'm missing is the piece where the preservation of like the people within those buildings is applied. I hear that. I believe in what Ms. Winifred was talking about, but where are the components within the historic landmark district that are specifically related to anti-displacement?

[Speaker 10] (1:54:29 - 1:54:50)
Chairman, I have also invited Daniel Bluestone, the director of the preservation program at Boston University, who wrote the national landmark application for Pilsen. And I would like it if he could answer that question. He is on the line.

[Speaker 1] (1:54:52 - 1:54:54)
Okay. Is that okay with you, Daniel?

[Speaker 34] (1:54:56 - 1:54:58)
I'm happy to be put on the spot. That would be fun.

[Speaker 1] (1:54:59 - 1:55:05)
Okay. Then identify yourself for the record. You've got probably a couple minutes to talk and try to address the...

[Speaker 34] (1:55:05 - 1:57:44)
Yes. My name is Daniel Bluestone. I was the author of the National Register District.

When we established the National Register District, there was no question, no question at all that Pilsen was a landmark district. And I think that continues to be the case today. And it certainly is a district that could easily, easily fit the criteria for landmarking and for designation.

The question about how landmark districts work in the interest of people that are resident in the district, in the case of people who have businesses in the district, it's not usually explicit in the regulations. But what you find across the country is that people build social capital in a community that has a storied past, that has roots in the fine fabric of their community, that it's part of what has for a very long time given Pilsen its identity. The fact that when people visit or people visit Pilsen and they call it Pilsen, they know that that character is contributing to their passion about the district.

And I find it very revealing how passionate people have been. There are ideas that landmarks somehow work against that, but actually landmarks historically across the country and across the world build local capacity, build identity. And it's not always high style architecture.

I think it was very notable that the Pilsen district was the largest National Register district when it was established. It went in concert actually with the bungalow initiative in Chicago, not high style architecture. And what we found in the case of the bungalow district is that people actually start viewing their community and their relationship with their neighbors very differently in the context of establishing historic landmarking.

And so that's where the capacity building comes from. And I think that that's the notable accomplishment of historic districts. Now, it looks like there's passion about the district that comes apart from or against his historic landmarks, but I still think the jury is out on how Pilsen residents plan to steward what has been stewarded historically.

And that is an extraordinary landscape that by any definition is a landmark designated, landmark designatable district.

[Speaker 61] (1:57:44 - 1:57:46)
All right, Daniel.

[Speaker 5] (1:57:46 - 1:59:05)
I mean, so those are certainly nice comments, but unfortunately they don't serve to answer my question. So I'll just close by saying, I mean, setting aside the utter strangeness of this body acting against both the wishes of an alderman whom a zoning ordinance applies to, but also the wishes of that person's community, I will say that while I have seen how preservation and affordability are inextricably related, certainly housing cannot filter down to lower income families if we demolish it entirely.

And the alderman's work around deconversion is certainly laudable. But what I feel like I'm hearing from Alderman Citio Lopez is that his community is not so much primarily concerned with the preservation of buildings as much as the preservation of a certain cultural and socioeconomic identity for the community. For which, like, we have tools for that.

We are working to expand our tools around that. But in hearing all of the testimony today, and admittedly not being a voting member of this body, I'm not fully convinced that historic preservation is the tool that most aptly accomplishes those goals for the communities.

[Speaker 1] (1:59:05 - 1:59:19)
Thank you, Daniel. Thank you, Daniel. And before we hear from Alderman Citio Lopez, Alderman Kappelman, your hand is up.

Do you have a very quick question for the alderman or the city?

[Speaker 17] (1:59:19 - 1:59:33)
Yes, very quick question about the deconversion ordinance proposal. It's sounding a little bit like it's a taking because there's no zoning change. So I need to hear either from the law department or someone.

Is there legal grounds for something along those lines?

[Speaker 1] (1:59:34 - 1:59:39)
Yeah, but I'm not sure that that's the subject that's pertinent to the vote on the landmarking.

[Speaker 17] (1:59:39 - 1:59:50)
Well, because I say that because the idea was not to have this historic district granted so that a deconversion ordinance could happen.

[Speaker 1] (1:59:53 - 1:59:58)
That's in the making, but I'm not sure. I'm sorry, James. Say it again.

[Speaker 17] (1:59:58 - 2:00:11)
So if a deconversion is not allowed, then that was a tool that would have helped us make this decision on whether or not to grant a historic district.

[Speaker 1] (2:00:14 - 2:00:16)
Anybody on the call want to answer that?

[Speaker 10] (2:00:17 - 2:00:19)
I think Patrick Murphy can speak to that issue.

[Speaker 1] (2:00:21 - 2:00:30)
All right. Well, Patrick, were you listening to Alderman Kappelman and quickly answer his question so we can hear from Byron and then take up? I'm assuming we'll have a roll call on this one.

[Speaker 6] (2:00:31 - 2:01:27)
I was Alderman Kappelman. This is Patrick Murphy. I would defer to the law department to a degree on most of your comment, but I would say that the ordinance that Alderman Sitio Lopez referenced that we're hoping to introduce later this month was focused on what takes place within an allowable zoning designation.

And it would be an action that would be taken by city council that would impact a specific area of the city. In this case, particular properties around Pilsen that are zoned RT4 or higher. We would not be mandating a zoning change, but it would be a special designation that council would enact that specifically impacts the density that's allowed on those particularly zoned properties.

I'm happy to get into more of the detail either later, if this does come up for a voted committee later this year, or with you offline to explain some of the nuances of what we're considering.

[Speaker 17] (2:01:29 - 2:01:41)
Okay, thank you. I thought we were in the process as a city of making guidelines more citywide rather than focus on specifically on communities, but thank you so much.

[Speaker 1] (2:01:41 - 2:01:53)
Thank you, James. Okay, I see no more hands up other than Byron Sitio Lopez. So Byron, you close the argument.

You've got five minutes. Okay.

[Speaker 2] (2:01:54 - 2:04:30)
Thank you, chairman. And I think this has been a very clear conversation, and I'm glad. I really appreciate Alderman Dowell's question around the guideline, right, that will govern landmarking, right?

I think that if the Department of Planning couldn't get those guidelines, you know, in two years almost, right? I mean, it's obviously reasonable for my residents to question the process with no guidelines. I mean, and the fact that some of these guidelines are not clear across the city should be a great concern to all my colleagues.

I do think that it is very clear that my constituents, more than anybody else, you know, do not approve. I find it also problematic to say that somehow technocrats have the ability to see things that regular people or my constituents cannot see. That's kind of insulting to say that, you know, the right thing to do is somehow disconnected to the wise thing to do.

I do think that both in this case, you heard it from experts on the field that my constituents are very capable of making decisions that are in their best interest. We have taken our time over two years to analyze these under public meetings with focus groups and experts on the field. I do appreciate the fact that there are economists that are putting their perspective as an economist as well and respect some of their opinions.

But we got to say as well that economists oftentimes get a lot of these things wrong. And qualitative analysis doesn't include people. So I know that, you know, they worry about the buildings.

And I think what my constituents are worried about is not only the people, it's the social fabric of a beautiful thriving community like Pilsen. We have a viable plan. You know, we have a way to address this.

And I think that's the way that we got to go. I think that it is clear that we not only are doing the right thing by democratically listening to my constituents, over 500 residents, that's unprecedented in terms of community engagement. But we also have the support of experts on the field.

Experts. And even the department we just heard from, from our zoning department. We do have options at the table that are ready to be introduced.

They're ready to be introduced so that we can do with legislation things that are important for our constituents. So the last, I would like to just give my two minutes, maybe for the last comments, maybe Professor Betancourt, I know that you had a few comments. I yelled my last 20 minutes and a half.

And I hope to my colleagues that I can get your support.

[Speaker 1] (2:04:32 - 2:04:37)
All right. Professor, you've got two minutes. Yes.

Thank you.

[Speaker 23] (2:04:37 - 2:06:04)
I am sorry, but I disagree completely with the way Commissioner Cox and his invitees address the question. Those answers were very skewed. Chicago is not Los Angeles.

And the study that they mentioned actually addresses areas that don't compare to Pilsen. Bring comparables, please, if you want to make an argument. Second, designation per se does not produce gentrification.

But designation of areas that are already undergoing gentrification does. In Chicago, the best example you have is Wicker Park and Buena Park that was designated, completed the wipeout of the low-income Latinos. And lastly, designation does not come with tax abatement.

So the argument is incomplete. If designation came with tax abatements for those people that are affected, if designation compensated for increases in property prices to everybody, I would agree with you. But you are telling only half of the story to make your case.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:06:06 - 2:06:18)
Okay. So I am going to see no more hands up. I'm going to ask for a roll call on the landmark ordinance.

[Speaker 37] (2:06:19 - 2:06:22)
Chairman, I move passage of the landmark ordinance.

[Speaker 1] (2:06:24 - 2:06:27)
I'm asking for without a roll call?

[Speaker 37] (2:06:27 - 2:06:29)
With a roll call. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:06:29 - 2:07:00)
All right. Okay. Give me one second to get my little thing.

Okay. All right. Let's start.

This is a vote no on would basically say that we're not supporting the landmark. And if you vote yes, you're voting to support the landmark ordinance. It's all pretty clear, right?

Nicole? It's clear. Okay.

Yes. Alderman Hopkins?

[Speaker 4] (2:07:01 - 2:07:01)
No.

[Speaker 1] (2:07:03 - 2:07:13)
Alderman Dowell? No. Alderman Sawyer?

No. Alderman Beal?

[Speaker 9] (2:07:14 - 2:07:14)
No.

[Speaker 1] (2:07:15 - 2:07:18)
Alderman Ray Lopez? Raymond?

[Speaker 9] (2:07:19 - 2:07:19)
No.

[Speaker 1] (2:07:20 - 2:07:22)
Alderman David Moore?

[Speaker 9] (2:07:23 - 2:07:24)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (2:07:26 - 2:07:34)
All right. Alderman Mike Rodriguez? No.

Alderman Sitio Lopez?

[Speaker 2] (2:07:35 - 2:07:35)
No.

[Speaker 1] (2:07:38 - 2:07:43)
Alderman Burnett? I see you've joined us. Alderman Burnett?

Oh.

[Speaker 9] (2:07:46 - 2:07:48)
Hold on. No.

[Speaker 40] (2:07:50 - 2:07:52)
I think Alderman Moore wants to change.

[Speaker 9] (2:07:52 - 2:08:14)
Chairman, I'm sorry. I thought the call was to vote on this. No, no.

I don't know if you're late to the call, but I reiterated what our instructions were for the vote. I apologize, and I need to change that to no. Hey, Rod, you got a garage, right?

Okay. All right. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:08:14 - 2:08:27)
Sorry about the misunderstanding. All right. Alderman Roboyas?

No. Alderman Cardona? No.

Alderman Waguespack?

[Speaker 61] (2:08:30 - 2:08:31)
No.

[Speaker 1] (2:08:33 - 2:08:38)
Alderman Austin? No. Alderman Villegas?

[Speaker 61] (2:08:38 - 2:08:38)
No.

[Speaker 1] (2:08:40 - 2:08:50)
Alderman Riley? Alderman Kaplan? No.

Alderman Osterman?

[Speaker 61] (2:08:51 - 2:08:51)
No.

[Speaker 1] (2:08:53 - 2:10:24)
And Alderman Hadden? No. And Chairman Tony votes no.

Okay, so the total we have 18 nos and zero yays. The nays have it. Item has failed to pass.

All right, we're going to move on. We're going to stay in the 25th Ward. And this item is ordinance number 20204530 in the 25th Ward calling for the temporary moratorium on the issuance of complete demolition permits for applications filed on or after November 1st, which in this case is probably December 1st, within the Pilsen Historic District.

So we're going to start with Alderman Siccio-Lopez. We're going to allow 10 minutes on this for your presentation. We'll have 10 minutes from the departments.

I know we have buildings, I think law, planning, housing. So we've got plenty of testimony from that side, but I'm going to limit to 10 minutes. And then we'll open it up for Q&A.

Again, same rules, five minutes. And I think we'll, again, allow Alderman Siccio-Lopez to close. All right.

So Siccio, you have 10 minutes to open, and then obviously you'll be closing.

[Speaker 2] (2:10:25 - 2:18:04)
Thank you. Thank you, Chairman. And I thank you to all my colleagues for supporting this important initiative that our office has put forward.

It is very important that we, and I think as we have seen the complexity of the issue, that we understand, you know, what's at stake here. Again, my community has voted on going in a different direction. It is clear that the Department of Planning does not agree with our decision of self-determination.

It is very clear that the Department of Planning continue to push for a plan that would have had tremendous implications for the most vulnerable homeowners, small businesses in my community. It is because I'm with a great responsibility that my role as Alderman has, that I have gotten the best experts on the field. And since September, I've been working diligently with the Department of Buildings and the Law Department.

On September 4th, we received an email from the Law Department. Mr. Ralph, Ralph Phillips-Santos, who unfortunately is not here today, from the Law Department, who worked with us so that we can have a legal bill in front of you. We, of course, had some legal challenges so that we could not bring this bill in front of you Since September, when we first introduced it, working with the Law Department, we have had conversations with the Buildings Department and Law Department.

Unfortunately, the Department of Planning has not joined these conversations that are important for our community. We have also joined conversations with the Housing Department so that we have a collaborative effort to protect an iconic, unique, beautiful community like Pilsen. A community that is not only a heart of the Latino community, but I think is one of those unique communities in the city of Chicago.

We work with the Law Department, the Department of Buildings, basically copying the same ordinance that was introduced and passed for the 606. I understand that this is an ordinance that is bigger than the 606 ordinance. It will cover more territory because this is historic.

Pilsen is already a historic district. We have a responsibility with this beautiful community, a historic district in Pilsen, to do everything we can to protect those vulnerable homeowners that are struggling. Essential workers are asking for help, relief, and the only ask to you, my colleagues, is to give us some time.

This ordinance was, again, discussed with the Buildings Department and the Law Department and the Department of Planning. I have asked in many occasions to give me any objections in writing, in writing, colleagues, because if there are objections, they must be in writing and in advance. We cannot be working for months on an ordinance and in the 11th hour change our minds and said, no, this is not what we support.

I do think that we have a responsibility as a legislative branch to bring forward proposals that, of course, are in partnership with executive. But also, they have to be conceived to protect the most vulnerable. I'm really concerned about the influence of the real estate industry.

The real estate industry and big developers who have been trying to impose their agenda against the will of my residents. This six-month moratorium, this freeze, is exactly in line and legal because this precedent, my colleagues, there is precedent. There is a 606 ordinance that is exactly the same as the ordinance that we're putting forward in front of you.

That was worked with the Legal Department and the Buildings Department. Furthermore, because we have a great concern if this creates any kind of burden in the Administrative Department, that my office will commit to a staffer to work directly for six months with the Buildings Department. I have talked to the Commissioner of the Buildings Department to make my staff available if there's any issues.

Furthermore, since the landmark designation was not approved, the Department of Planning had allocated funds for consultants to continue the process of landmarking. I believe that if there's any issues, this funding should go towards addressing any concerns or any administrative work that has to do to make sure that during these six months, we help with this plan that we have ready to act. We have ordinances that are ready to act.

We hear from Patrick Murphy. We have a deconversion ordinance ready to pass next month working with the Housing Department. We have an ARO pilot that I have the pleasure to join with Alderman Burnett, Alderman Osterman.

We've been working on ARO pilot. We hope to have, hopefully for early next year, an ARO pilot that will also help us address the issues that we have in our community. We have also working with our local Commissioner.

We've been working with Commissioner Anaya on an ordinance at the county level that will address the issue of property taxes to the constituents because there is a huge issue with that 500%. But let's not make any mistake. The vote today is a vote of integrity.

It is a vote of integrity and I have faith that my colleagues will stand with the local decision and stand with the community, stand with the Pilsen residents and against the will of a real estate industry that for way too long dominated the agenda in my community to the detriment and the displacement of residents. I urge the city departments to work with my administration that work in collaboration and in good faith to create solutions for a community that has been hurt drastically and unfortunately for way too long by corruption and exclusion. Today, it is a new era.

I ask you, my colleagues, to support these efforts. There may a lot that is going to be said, but when I was in those meetings with the buildings department and the law department, and I have all the paperwork to show that, that we have their support and no objections, no one objection in writing about this demolition freeze. That's what this item is in front of you for consideration because we do need those six months that are crucial for us to implement policies so that we don't have, you know, later issues of people who are begging for help when a time when it's too late.

We have the opportunity now, my colleagues, now today to protect the historic beautiful community that is asking us to take action. I understand the views of administration are different in terms of gentrification. I understand that there's views that favor the real estate industry, but I represent my constituents, the constituents that elected me and trusted me that we can do this in a different way.

We're changing courses, and I am confident that those six months will give us the opportunity to really tell our constituents, and I have faith in you, my colleagues, that we can be the legislative branch that can legislate in the best interest of our constituents, the constituents that we have to represent. So please, I ask you, and I want to give a few more minutes to add anything for Professor Betancourt or Janet, Professor Curran, to add to my remarks. Thank you, and I hope that you can support that.

[Speaker 1] (2:18:04 - 2:18:10)
Thank you, Alderman, and whoever is going to speak, identify themselves. We have two minutes and 20 seconds.

[Speaker 23] (2:18:11 - 2:19:04)
Let me take a first stab. Chicago's zoning system is quite backward. A lot of cities throughout the country are coming up with changes to zoning that are very, very flexible and that respond to communities and allow for dialogues between communities and cities.

Chicago approves every time there is a request by a developer changes, but when the community is trying to ask, it corners them. So my point here is to change this mold, this culture, and to add new instruments, time is needed, and I definitely think it's very, very important for the democratic process to give time to communities to discuss these things. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:19:04 - 2:19:08)
Thank you, Professor. How about Professor Curran, I believe, Winifred?

[Speaker 23] (2:19:08 - 2:19:09)
Yes, thank you.

[Speaker 30] (2:19:09 - 2:19:47)
Obviously, I just second and third what Byron and John just said, that the six months is not a long time in the greater scheme of things, especially in the middle of a global pandemic, that while there has been a pause on demolitions while the Landmark Preservation District was considered, because the Landmark Preservation District took up so much of the organizing time and the political time fighting it, there has not been equivalent amount of time to devote to organizing around the alternative.

So this demolition freeze allows for that time to make good decisions around policies that come from the community, rather than a top-down, city-driven approach.

[Speaker 1] (2:19:48 - 2:20:05)
Thank you. All right. So, Alderman, I think we're going to hear from the city's departments.

Who would like to start first? Do we have our Planning Commissioner organized, or our Building Commissioner? Who do we want to start with?

[Speaker 19] (2:20:07 - 2:24:14)
Chairman, it's a Mappleday Building Commissioner. I'd be happy to start. Okay.

All right, Matt. Good morning, Chairman Toney, Vice Chairman Roboyas, and the honorable members of the committee. For the record, I'm Mappleday, the Commissioner of the Department of Buildings.

Regarding the proposed Pilsen Demolition Moratorium Zone, the department continues to have legal concerns about demolition moratorium zones. Deputy Corporation Counsel Lisa Misha is on the line, and I defer those legal and constitutional concerns to the Law Department for further comment, if they wish. I'd like to first speak about the operational limitations for implementing the demolition moratoriums.

Proposed area closely mirrors the U.S. Pilsen Historic District, which contains over 5,200 buildings, over 704 acres, according to federal documents. I believe the previous Pilsen Landmark District, proposed by the city, contained 850 buildings and landmarks, and holds a place in those buildings for two years now. The proposed moratorium would add another six months to those 850 buildings and throw an additional 4,400 buildings into that hold pattern.

Currently, large system holds, such as city landmarks, are placed on the city's outdated Hansen system by the Department of Planning and Development. Given the enormous volume of adding 4,400 more buildings to the proposed moratorium area, city departments do not have the resources to manually input the volume of holds into the system. It's not a matter of throwing bodies at it to put it in.

Holds in the antiquated Hansen 7 system are also not ideal and act to slow down all building permits citywide, as the current address-based holds cannot be limited to a specific permit type. In other words, an address-based hold would prevent the issuance not only of a demolition permit, but also would prevent the issuance of permits for minor repairs for any address within the moratorium zone, requiring either a DOB or DPD supervisor to manually lift those holds on each and every occasion. Like with the 606, any moratorium must be a manual process in our current limited system.

For the 606, I personally created a boundary map with address ranges for our permit staff, and they manually check a permit application against the map boundaries, plus the specific 606 moratorium criteria. The proposed Pilsen District would pose a greater challenge as the boundaries are not aligned in a four-street rectangular area like the 606, but rather have boundaries that weave in and out of streets, and some of those streets are diagonal as well. Unlike the 606 moratorium, which applies only to residential buildings, the proposed Pilsen moratorium applies to all buildings, which would include non-residential properties such as vacant commercial and office buildings, which could be potentially converted to new affordable residence.

Furthermore, any unnecessary encumbrance on property serves to decrease not only the value of property, but also the ability of homeowners to obtain funding for necessary building upkeep and repair to stay in their homes. The ability to maintain and repair a building can lead to a deterioration and demolition as well. Given the limited description above, I do have serious operational concerns about creating another manual map checking process, potentially encouraging more, and introducing that into the overall building permit process.

The impact is not just limited to the ward and the specific area. It is going to impact permits citywide. It's a credit to our staff that the department has been able to significantly reduce the time to permit.

We are currently at 62 days for permit, 26 of those days, which is with city staff. Thank you for allowing me to share the operational impact with all of you. I respect whatever decision the committee and the council comes to on this matter.

In lieu of more manual moratorium zones, I believe the Department of Housing, Commissioner Navarro, is working with Alderman on some alternative solutions. I will let Commissioner Navarro testify to those chair wishes. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:24:15 - 2:24:19)
Thank you, Commissioner. Commissioner Navarro, would you like to be second?

[Speaker 44] (2:24:21 - 2:26:52)
Happily. Thank you, Chairman. Thank you, Commissioner Beaudet.

I just want to give a brief overview of the plan for the anti-deconversion ordinance that we are planning to introduce later this month. Just to give some background to what we're talking about, I think just to ground this in the fact that we're all accustomed to, under the current zoning code, if you want to increase the density on a given parcel, you have to go through a process to receive approval to do so. We've had no structure in place, though, to provide the same safeguard if you want to lessen density.

So, if you want to take an existing three-flat and turn it into a single-family home, to this point, the zoning code is silent on that. But we know that in many neighborhoods, two- to six-unit buildings are an important source of unsubsidized, moderate-cost housing, and in gentrifying neighborhoods, we tend to see significant loss of two- to six-unit buildings, loss to deconversions or teardowns for high-end single-family homes. So, the measure that we're proposing would interrupt the loss of two- to six-unit buildings by requiring the zoning change, both for increasing density, which is already there, and for reducing density, which is new.

So, now, if someone wants to deconvert a three-flat to a single-family home, they would need to provide notice, go through a public process, come before the zoning committee. It essentially spotlights when and where this is happening so that the best decision for the community can be made. What we do know about this so far, we have preliminary data from the Institute for Housing Studies from DePaul, and they show that a comparable measure in the 606 area would have interrupted around 60% of the deconversions that occurred between 2013 and 2018.

So, the measure would put a check on one of the most significant ways that displacement happens through changes in the housing stack. So, this, coupled with the Pilsen and Little Village Housing Preservation and Anti-Displacement Plan, which Department of Housing Managing Deputy Cindy Soto has been putting in place with aldermen Sigto Lopez, Cardenas, and Rodriguez, would enact resources that we have allocated for long-time homeowner's repairs and financing to assure continued affordability.

[Speaker 1] (2:26:54 - 2:27:01)
Thank you. Thank you. How about Commissioner Pax, or a member for DPD?

[Speaker 10] (2:27:03 - 2:27:42)
Yes, thank you. We have been working with the housing department and the aldermen that represent Little Village and Pilsen on this strategy for anti-displacement and anti-deconversion. And independent of a six-month moratorium, we are willing and able to continue to work with the aldermen on these tools and others.

So, I'm happy to continue that partnership, continue to explore tools. All right.

[Speaker 1] (2:27:44 - 2:27:51)
Do we have someone at all on law that would like to speak at this point, other than our building commissioner?

[Speaker 40] (2:27:52 - 2:30:10)
Oh, sure. Thank you, Chairman Tunney. This is Lisa Mischer.

And I think it would just be helpful to identify the standard that would apply if the moratorium were challenged. So, demolition moratoria are challenged routinely as partial takings. And a court in reviewing any particular moratorium ordinance would look at the duration of the ordinance and its breadth, what it covers.

So, in this case, duration would include not just the six months of the present moratorium, or it very likely wouldn't include the six months of this particular moratorium ordinance, but would look at the previous prohibition that has been in place since Commission on Chicago Landmarks adopted a preliminary recommendation for the landmark district. That was in December 2018. So, since December 2018, any permit for demolition and really for any change to potentially landmark or contributing buildings in the district have been subject to a commission review and approval, as Deanna had mentioned.

So, this would be six months on top of that previous two years. And so, that would be one of the things a court would take into consideration. Generally, courts in deciding these cases will weigh the public benefits or that's intended to be served by the public interest intended to be served by the ordinance versus the, or as compared to the burden on private owners.

These cases are as applied cases. So, they're generally not facial challenges. So, the particular circumstances of any property owner would be what the court would be reviewing and taking into account.

[Speaker 1] (2:30:13 - 2:30:26)
All right. So, that ends the presentation, I believe, from the city side. Questions, we'll start with Alderman David Moore.

[Speaker 9] (2:30:27 - 2:32:53)
David. Thank you, Chairman. You're doing a good job on this, Chairman.

So, I appreciate it so much. I just wanted to, it's not a question, more of a statement, something that Alderman Baron Sancho Lopez had stated, but then I think he's since probably cleaned it up. I don't think, through my communications and everything, I don't think it's the administration not trying to help poor people or anything like that or help those that are disadvantaged.

I think there's a situation where there's been great dialogue around this, but then there seems to be just not a meeting of minds. And the road that sometimes we try to take to try to do the right thing is sometimes different paths. And so, in this case, for whatever reason that the Alderman and the administration can't come to an agreement is one of those things you got to agree to disagree.

And hopefully, I do hear when he talks about putting things in writing for him, that has to sometimes be there, and it can be helpful to an Alderman when they're trying to work with any administration. And I know sometimes people are reluctant. I wasn't in all meetings, so I don't know if that's the case or not, but by him stating it, it leads me to concern some things I've worked with in previous administrations and haven't had that problem here yet, but hopefully I won't.

But when we get to that case, the legislative body, which is the Alderman, who is very close to his ward, has to live and sometimes die with that situation because just as they are constantly hearing about all the bad things, again, all the calls that no one else is getting when things are rough, they have to make those decisions. But I just wanted to say that because I didn't want it to be out in the air that this administration don't care about trying to do what's right. I believe that they do, but I think it's an issue of the meeting of the minds.

And again, that Alderman is closer to his constituents and having the meetings that he seems like he's had from people that has called in and information that he's presented is very crucial to this. So I just wanted to make that statement in terms of making sure that we can hopefully move forward in supporting this Alderman in terms of what he wants to do for his community. Thank you.

All right.

[Speaker 4] (2:32:57 - 2:35:58)
Alderman Brian Hopkins. Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just listening with great interest to the response from the law department, Ms. Mishner, to the question of whether or not this is a taking. And she gave a very detailed and very lawyerly answer, which of course is her role. But as a non-lawyer, I'm going to interpret that without regard to the subtleties of whether it's meeting the legal challenges for takings and whatever individual cases might eventually proceed if we were to pass this. I understand all that.

But thinking as a property owner, if you own a parcel of land and you have a structure upon it and you desire to change that structure within the current zoning, you have vested legal rights. And if we pass this, you won't, at least for six months. And if it's a bad idea for one month, it's a bad idea for six months.

It's a bad idea for 12 months. I didn't support this when it applied to the 606 area. I'm not going to support it here.

I was honored to stand with my colleague on the previous matter and to vote, not only my conscience, but in the reflected wishes of his community, as he so passionately explained. But that doesn't apply here. Not only the citywide implications of going forward on a piecemeal demolition ban across the city, potentially, because this is the second one that I've been involved in.

It needs to stop. This is a bad policy. And when you consider the argument that we just had, where we resolved a two and a half year, bitter, at times, very bitter controversy, is the structures of Pilsen worthy of official landmark status and all the protections that would accompany therewith?

We just said no. We just resolved that. That is the only legitimate and traditional reason to tell a property owner that you're taking their rights away from them and they can't demolish the structure that they own because it's a landmark, because it serves the greater good to preserve it, because a careful, objective study has been completed and concluded that it should override those individual property rights and the structure should be preserved. We just settled that matter in Pilsen. So to have it both ways, and to pass this ordinance, and for arbitrary reasons, tell those property owners, we're going to give you another six months where you can't exercise your rights to build something within the existing zoning that was determined to be appropriate years ago.

Ladies and gentlemen, I cannot support this. This is the wrong course of action. With all due respect to my colleague, who, as I said, I was proud to stand with on the previous issue, I cannot support this and I will be voting no.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:35:59 - 2:36:02)
Thank you, Alderman Hopkins. Alderman Brendan Riley.

[Speaker 12] (2:36:04 - 2:37:20)
Thank you, Chairman. I also echo Alderman Hopkins' comments on this. If the decision is that a landmark district should not be put in place for Pilsen, I respect the wishes of the local alderman on that matter and his constituents.

He's doing his job. But you can't have it both ways. And I think in this particular case, if there was a clear and present threat to important historic structures, then perhaps the community would have taken advantage of the tool of landmarking, but resoundingly that was rejected.

But I agree, this could be construed as a taking. I think we all here on the City Council just struggled through a couple months of budget making where we've been on the receiving end of lawsuit upon lawsuit upon lawsuit. And we've been paying out settlement after settlement after settlement.

And I think it would be a mistake to engage in this sort of haphazard demo moratoria throughout the city. That is not an appropriate public policy and I'll be voting no. And also Chairman, I'd like to request that we vote on this item and I'd like to request a roll call.

[Speaker 1] (2:37:21 - 2:37:27)
Thank you. Thank you, Alderman Riley. Alderman Harry Osterman.

[Speaker 51] (2:37:30 - 2:39:30)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will say that this is an issue that I struggle with. And I did support Alderman Sitko Lopez on the non-landmarking.

But I chair the Housing and Real Estate Committee and I think that the ordinances that were previously mentioned are going to be coming before my committee in short order. I think that's a better public policy to deal with those. Alderman Sitko Lopez has been an alderman for 18 months and he's shown his inability to work with the administration and his colleagues to get something done.

But as the Housing and Real Estate Committee Chairman, I'm committed to work with him and the people of Pilsen to solve their issues. While I agree with what Alderman Hopkins said about the issues of doing this, Pilsen's a unique community that's felt significant gentrification. And I think that it's, in my own personal opinion as a chairman of the Housing and Real Estate Committee speaking only for myself, I'm going to support the six months.

It is six months that is a window of time. It's six months to see if Alderman Sitko Lopez can develop plans and work with colleagues in the administration in a constructive way to help the people of his community. I am committed to that.

I'm committed to working with the agencies and all stakeholders, including the residents of Pilsen, to address these issues and do it quickly. We don't have to wait six months to address these issues. These are things that can be worked on and quite frankly should have been worked on since day one.

So today I am willing to support giving the six month window one time. But I think that it's inherent on the Alderman to work on solutions and have those be done quickly, not at some point in the future.

[Speaker 1] (2:39:31 - 2:39:35)
Thank you, Alderman. Alderman La Spada.

[Speaker 5] (2:39:35 - 2:41:05)
Thank you, Chairman. I just want to voice my support for what Alderman Sitko Lopez is trying to accomplish here. Certainly, I hear the dissonance from my colleagues in terms of why would we vote against one tool and vote for the other?

But I think it speaks to the notion that historic quality is not the only reason to pursue preservation. We know that the housing stock of our community has a value regardless of what it looks like and that maintaining a diversity of housing stock, both in form and affordability, is a public good for our communities. I also hear and applaud what Chairman Osterman is speaking to, who has been a great source of counsel in some of the anti-displacement, anti-demolition, anti-deconversion work that we're working on, as well as Commissioner Navarro.

I think six months is fair, but speaking for myself, I don't even think it's going to take that long to pass some really powerful, transformative legislation. Certainly, I know we don't have that much time up in the Logan Square-Hubbell Park area, but I hope folks will look favorably on the ordinance that Alderman Ciccio-Lopez is putting forward today.

[Speaker 1] (2:41:06 - 2:41:08)
Thank you, Alderman. Alderman Patrick Thompson.

[Speaker 16] (2:41:11 - 2:42:20)
Thank you, Chair. I'm not a member of this committee and I was informed of this ordinance being up today. My concern with this is that it does affect part of my ward.

The boundaries in which the Alderman from the 25th ward was including, included parts of the 11th ward. I've never had a conversation with him and my hesitation is not knowing much about it and not having a chance to talk to my neighbors, that I would be, I'm not a voting member, but I would ask the members to not support this because it affects my community and my neighbors and they haven't had an opportunity to be informed. I haven't had a chance to even have a discussion with them.

So, I appreciate what the Alderman's intent is, but, you know, without speaking to me about it and without speaking to my neighbors, I have a real reservation on moving any legislation without first having discussions and community meetings. So, I just wanted to share that as well. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:42:20 - 2:42:24)
Point of information, Alderman David Moore.

[Speaker 9] (2:42:25 - 2:42:43)
I appreciate Alderman Thompson saying that, Ken. The Alderman Tito Lopez validated that or not? Well, we will hear from Alderman Tito Lopez so he can respond to any of the testimony previous to that.

[Speaker 1] (2:42:43 - 2:43:03)
So, I'm sure he'll be talking about that, but I want to know if there's any other committee members that have any questions for the city or the Alderman at this point. Okay. I don't see any hands up.

So, to close, we have five minutes with Alderman Tito Lopez. Alderman.

[Speaker 2] (2:43:04 - 2:48:13)
Thank you. Thank you, Chairman. Thank you again, everyone, for taking interest on this important topic and people at the moment for a community like Pilsen.

I'd just like to do a few points of clarification. We're not talking about hundreds of buildings that are going to apply for demolitions. You know, in the 606 alone, I think the data was eight demolition applications.

So, I think that some of these fear tactics around, you know, how it's going to create this, you know, overwhelming burden on the department is just simply not factual. I think that if we will add, you know, a bigger area, we'll still be manageable. I think that we've done it, you know, for six months for the 606.

And I think that we have seen, you know, the terrible consequences of it. I think that a community like Pilsen absolutely is worth preserving. Absolutely is worth preserving.

Absolutely. I mean, we have heard time after time, the beauty of the immigrant community, the beauty of all the social fabric of Pilsen was let's take action and protect it. Let's take action, you know, and work together.

I think that I hear, you know, the concerns and I hear, you know, my colleagues, you know, frustration about, you know, perhaps the inability to put forward and get into consensus. I tell you, we've been waiting for this vote for months. We've been waiting to even have a chance to be heard for months.

The inability to bring ideas to the table doesn't come from my administration. Certainly doesn't come from my constituents. We have participated for years, months in public meetings, focus groups, experts, putting forward a proposal that works.

And I think this does. We also, we heard about like the potential issue with property rights. In fact, the landmark designation of 950 buildings would have been, and this is a permanent decision that will absolutely impact the property rights of homeowners.

And it's permanent. We are talking about a six month moratorium delay that has precedent. And I thank Alderman Osterman for willing as a housing committee chair to work with us on policies.

It's not the way we have been trying to bring. We already have some of these proposals ready for you. As you have heard, we're working in good faith.

We're bringing proposals with the housing department, with the county even. We are showing the ability to work not only within the city council, but within the county. I think that we need to make sure that we encourage the administration to show the same spirit of collaboration.

And I know that you all know that. We need to make sure that we encourage the administration to work with every single one of us, despite of the differences that we have. That's what leadership is.

To make sure that every neighborhood in the city has the same treatment, the same respect. Six months that we did under the 606. And I think we heard how special Pilsen is.

We heard it from the PD. We have heard it for every department. But more than anything else, you have heard it from the residents of this community that they have built with sweat and tears.

I ask for simply more time. Six months, six months. And I think our community has been waiting for a long time.

Two years for the opportunity to come in front of you. We will commit to make sure that we do everything in our power. Everything in our power to work with every department as we have shown.

To every alderman as we have shown. And to work even outside with the county to provide the solutions that our community needs and deserves. You can be sure that your vote is a vote that we're proud to count on.

That is going to be addressing displacement. Alderman Thompson, it may have been that it is maybe because we have shared streets. That perhaps there's something that may be remotely close to your ward.

I'll commit to make sure that we have an amendment to make sure that this is a 25th ward. And this has been all along a 25th ward. Lonely and only issue.

I hope that my colleagues, you know, we don't set bad precedents that the local community cannot decide on their own. That would be a bad precedent to set. We have a responsibility with every neighborhood, every neighborhood to work in the best interest of the homeowners, the tenants, the small businesses.

I guarantee that there will not be huge issues in this. We only have seen I think four demolitions in the last almost two years. Two years.

I guarantee that in our community, we have 500 affidavits of support. So when we worry about, you know, when we worry about the lawsuits and all that, we heard it clearly from legal. We can overcome these challenges.

I think that there's 40 lawsuits that we paid all the time for the wrong reason. This is an important issue. I'm proud to support this and, you know, work with it because we help the most vulnerable.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:48:13 - 2:48:23)
Thank you, Alderman. Alderman Riley calls for the roll call on this item. So we'll start as we speak.

Okay.

[Speaker 9] (2:48:23 - 2:48:25)
Chairman, Alderman Moore.

[Speaker 1] (2:48:25 - 2:48:28)
What do you have, David? A point of information?

[Speaker 9] (2:48:28 - 2:48:42)
Yes. It wasn't clear for me in his answer. You said he was answered in there.

Does any of this touch Alderman Thompson's ward? Okay. Byron, is that a correct statement or not?

[Speaker 2] (2:48:44 - 2:48:47)
I'm working with the legal department. It may be incidental.

[Speaker 24] (2:48:48 - 2:48:49)
Is it yes or no?

[Speaker 2] (2:48:51 - 2:48:54)
I'm not so sure, but I will say I will revise it and I will.

[Speaker 1] (2:48:55 - 2:48:59)
So the answer is he's not sure. Okay. So, all right.

[Speaker 9] (2:48:59 - 2:49:05)
Can I make a motion to hold this item until we are sure? No, we already have a motion on the floor from Alderman Riley on the roll call.

[Speaker 18] (2:49:11 - 2:49:23)
Quickly, Alderman Dowell. Yes. Do you know how many demolitions have demolition requests or permits in the last six months in 25?

[Speaker 1] (2:49:24 - 2:49:31)
I will quickly ask Matt Boudot because I personally don't know. And we'll get a quick answer and then we're doing the roll call.

[Speaker 19] (2:49:33 - 2:49:48)
Yes, Alderman. I've got the information in front of me. So there was one, two, three, four, five, six.

Six in 2020. And then one, two, three, four, five, six, seven in 2029. Go ahead, Matt.

[Speaker 1] (2:49:49 - 2:49:51)
By the way, it's 2019, I think, Matt.

[Speaker 19] (2:49:51 - 2:49:53)
All right. Yeah, it's 2019. Sorry.

[Speaker 1] (2:49:53 - 2:50:07)
All right. Thank you. Okay.

Now, I'm just going to, what I'm going to do before I get the roll call. I'm going to have a very quick from Thompson since his question was about a boundary question. Patrick.

[Speaker 16] (2:50:09 - 2:50:22)
Thanks, Chair. Yeah, it's the west side of Halston from 16th and 22nd. We go over to green.

So that's all in my ward, which is included in the boundaries here, just to clarify. All right. Let's start with the roll.

Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:50:23 - 2:50:49)
Now, voting yes means you're supporting the demo freeze that Alderman Sitio Lopez proposes. Voting no means you do not support the demolition freeze in the 25th ward or in the National Historic District because it's obviously, according to Patrick Thompson, it's a little bit more than the 25th ward. So everybody understand?

Yes.

[Speaker 61] (2:50:49 - 2:50:49)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (2:50:50 - 2:50:52)
Okay. Alderman Hopkins.

[Speaker 61] (2:50:52 - 2:50:53)
No.

[Speaker 1] (2:50:54 - 2:51:02)
Alderman Dowell. No. Alderman Sawyer.

Aye. Alderman Beal.

[Speaker 56] (2:51:02 - 2:51:03)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (2:51:05 - 2:51:07)
Alderman Rae Lopez.

[Speaker 56] (2:51:07 - 2:51:08)
No.

[Speaker 1] (2:51:09 - 2:51:16)
Alderman Mike Rodriguez. Aye. Alderman Sitio Lopez.

[Speaker 24] (2:51:17 - 2:51:17)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (2:51:19 - 2:51:29)
Alderman Burnett. Alderman... Oh, I did.

I skipped David Moore. David, I'm sorry.

[Speaker 9] (2:51:29 - 2:51:30)
That would be sorry.

[Speaker 1] (2:51:31 - 2:51:33)
What's your vote on this one?

[Speaker 9] (2:51:33 - 2:51:34)
No.

[Speaker 1] (2:51:35 - 2:52:03)
All right. Alderman Roboyes. I'm sorry.

Yes. Alderman Roboyes. Alderman Cardona.

No. Alderman Waguespack. No.

Alderman Villegas. No. Alderman Riley.

No. Alderman Kappelman. No.

Alderman Osterman. Aye. Alderman Hadden.

[Speaker 24] (2:52:04 - 2:52:05)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (2:52:06 - 2:52:15)
And Chairman Tony votes no. I think you skipped... Mr. Chairman, I think you skipped...

I'm sorry. Oh my God. Please.

Carrie Austin. I'm sorry.

[Speaker 17] (2:52:16 - 2:52:17)
She votes no.

[Speaker 1] (2:52:18 - 2:52:29)
All right. My... David, thanks for apologizing for me on behalf of Carrie and the rest of us.

So it's been a heated debate. So what is the total, Nicole?

[Speaker 47] (2:52:30 - 2:52:35)
Chairman, chairman, chairman, you called me, right? I did. Yeah, I vote yes on this.

[Speaker 24] (2:52:35 - 2:52:38)
Vote yes. Okay. Seven.

[Speaker 1] (2:52:42 - 2:56:07)
So we have seven yeas and 10 nays. So this item does not pass. All right.

Okay. Thank you, everybody. And again, we look forward to working as Alderman Osterman says with Alderman Sitio Lopez on how to do preservation a different way without the demolition ordinance that he proposes.

So with that, I'm going to move on into signs. All right. We have large signs over 100 square feet in area, 24 feet above grade.

We will hear them all together. I will read the ward followed by the address and take a motion at the end. Starting in the third ward, a sign at 123.

That's 123 East Cermak Road. In the 13th ward, two signs at 6545 South Pulaski Road. In the 18th ward, a sign at 7353 South Cicero Avenue.

In the 20th ward, two signs at 1120 West 47th Place. In the 22nd ward, two signs at 4228 West 35th Place. In the 25th ward, one sign at 150 West Roosevelt Road.

In the 25th ward, a sign at 2353 South Wentworth Avenue. In the 27th ward, a sign at 404 North Armour Street. In the 27th ward, a sign at 333 North Green Street.

Also in the 27th ward, a sign at 1100 West Fulton Street. In the 31st ward, a sign at 2424 North Pulaski Road. Also in the 31st ward, two signs at 4441 West Diversity Avenue.

In the 35th ward, a sign at 3444 North Hedsey Avenue. In the 41st ward, two signs at 8725 through 8745 West Higgins Road. In the 42nd ward, a sign at 702 West Fulton Market.

Also in the 42nd ward, a sign at 35 North State Street. Again in the 42nd ward, a sign at 110 East Oak Street. And finally, in the 42nd ward, a sign at 550 West Van Buren Street.

Moving to the 43rd ward, a sign at 2730 North Halsted Street. In the 44th ward, a sign at 1111 West Addison Street. In the 45th ward, a sign at 5050 West Foster Avenue.

And lastly, in the 50th ward, a sign at 7558 North Western Avenue. If there are no further questions or questions by committee members, do I hear a motion to pass on all the orders by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 34] (2:56:07 - 2:56:08)
So moved by Alderman Beal.

[Speaker 1] (2:56:10 - 2:56:17)
Alderman Beal moves to pass. Any objections? Hearing none, the orders are passed.

[Speaker 40] (2:56:20 - 2:56:20)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (2:56:22 - 3:11:59)
What I'm asking, we're going to take what, a 15 minute? All right, I'm asking to take a 10, let's say a 10 minute breather. It's been a long morning and we will reconvene at what time?

105. All right. So thank you for your patience and we look forward to seeing you.

Grab a quick bite and we'll see you at 105. All right. Thank you again, committee members.

We are now going to move on to the regular agenda. In order to minimize technical difficulties and to ensure the committee meeting runs as smoothly as possible, the typical order in which items will be heard has been updated. Throughout the duration of virtual committee and zoning meetings, items will be grouped together according to witnesses and attorneys and will be heard in that order rather than in the ward order.

And then finally, we're going to hold the first few pages of Aldermanics and go straight to the middle of page three. We'll hear Aldermanics at the conclusion of the private applications. So we're going to move to page three on that.

And we're on the top of page three. This is item number A... One second.

No. Thank God for staff. All right.

Item number 20520T1 in the 50th ward. The ordinance was referred on October 7th of 2020. The common address is 2411 West Finch Avenue, 7080 through 7106 Northwestern Avenue.

The change request, a B32 Community Shopping District to a B23 Neighborhood Shopping District. We have Tom Moore as the attorney. Mr. Moore. Yes, sir.

[Speaker 11] (3:11:59 - 3:12:50)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Tom Moore for the record. This is a situation where there were seven storefronts in there.

As of December 31st, the seventh will move out and they'll all be vacant, but it's a viable building. And so we went to Alderman Silverstein and we had a Zoom well-attended community meeting and requested to change the storefronts into accessible residential dwelling units. And both the community and the alderman, we have the community and the alderman support and we request your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (3:12:53 - 3:13:02)
All right. Mr. Moore, we do have a letter of support from Alderman Silverstein. Are there questions from committee members?

[Speaker 9] (3:13:04 - 3:13:06)
No question, move to pass by Alderman David Moore.

[Speaker 1] (3:13:06 - 3:13:17)
All right. Alderman David Moore moves to pass by the same motion that was used to determine roll call. Any objections to that?

[Speaker 9] (3:13:18 - 3:13:19)
No.

[Speaker 1] (3:13:20 - 3:13:25)
Thanks, David. Hearing none, the item is passed as amended.

[Speaker 24] (3:13:27 - 3:13:30)
There was no substitute. Oh, just pass regularly.

[Speaker 1] (3:13:30 - 3:13:49)
I'm sorry. It was passed regularly. There was no substitute.

So for the record, it was just passed without an amendment. All right. Okay.

Now I'm going to ask my vice chair, Roboius to assume the chair while an item is heard in the 44th ward. Thank you, chairman.

[Speaker 47] (3:13:52 - 3:14:22)
Thank you, chairman. Item number 20521-T1 in the 44th ward, an ordinance that was referred on October 7th, 2020. The common address is 3250 North Park Street.

The change request is a B3-3 Community Shopping District to a B2-3 Neighborhood Shopping District. We also have on board here, Tom Moore, here to represent the aldermanic request.

[Speaker 11] (3:14:23 - 3:15:06)
Thank you, Alderman Roboius and members of the committee. This is an older building in Alderman Tunney's ward on Clark Street, just north of Belmont Avenue. And it's within the TOD area.

Originally when we filed it, our plan showed nine units and we went through a community process with Alderman Tunney and ended up with eight units. So I would ask that you allow us to move forward on a substitute narrative and plan.

[Speaker 18] (3:15:10 - 3:15:13)
Thank you, Alderman. Move to accept the substitute, chairman.

[Speaker 47] (3:15:14 - 3:15:24)
Questions by committee members? If there are no questions by committee members, Alderman Tunney, Chairman Tunney.

[Speaker 40] (3:15:25 - 3:15:29)
Alderman Dowell moved to accept the substitute. He just asked to move to.

[Speaker 1] (3:15:30 - 3:15:37)
All right, Alderman Roboius, Alderman Dowell moved for the substitute. Do you want to get the vote on the substitute?

[Speaker 47] (3:15:37 - 3:15:39)
So move on to tough substitute.

[Speaker 1] (3:15:40 - 3:16:16)
Okay, perfect. Now, in regards to the alderman, now as the alderman of the 44th ward, as Mr. Moore said, this went through a community process. It's adjacent to residential on the property to the north.

This individual building had seen its commercial vacancy for probably about five or six years. And I am in support, as is the community organization that surrounds it on allowing residential on the ground floor at this address. So I'd ask for your favorable consideration, committee members.

[Speaker 47] (3:16:18 - 3:16:42)
Okay, are there any questions by committee members? If not, can I get a motion to pass in the same roll call? Move to pass by Alderman Dowell.

As amended, I believe. As amended, as amended. All in favor?

Aye. Aye. Chairs, the ayes have it.

The item is passed.

[Speaker 1] (3:16:42 - 3:17:26)
All right, thank you, vice chair. All right, top of page four, document number 20519, the 28th ward. Ordinance was referred on October 7th of 2020.

Common address is 4531 through 4559 West Washington Boulevard. The change request, RT4 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district and a C12 neighborhood commercial district to a RM 4.5 residential multi-unit district. Mr. Moore, again.

[Speaker 11] (3:17:27 - 3:18:37)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. This is a case I've been working with Kareem Musawwir and architect Howard Garrison, and they've been involved for a lot longer than I, but basically this is a department of housing, all affordable, 43 dwelling units, four story building. And it's, I believe using federal or state funds to build this all affordable building.

And, but in order to have the 43 units, and make it all residential, we need the RM 4.5. And there's been a lot of involvement in the community and vetting this, this has changed. The project has changed many times, but not since I filed it. So we don't need a substitute.

And we would respectfully, we have a letter from Alderman Irvin supporting it. We respectfully request your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (3:18:45 - 3:19:38)
Okay. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Irvin. Questions by committee members?

Hearing no questions. Can I get a motion to do that? Alderman Hadden moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed. All right.

Now we're moving to the middle of page four, item number 20518, 11th Ward. Ordinance was referred on October 7th of 2020. The common address is 3084 South Locke Street.

Change request from a B23 neighborhood shopping district to an RM 5.5 residential multi-unit district. Tom Moore, Tom.

[Speaker 11] (3:19:39 - 3:20:52)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. This is a old, basically industrial or commercial building in the 11th Ward that the owners would like to add apartments to. The industrial use is long gone and there really isn't anywhere to put parking on the property.

It's one of those properties that has the vaulted sidewalks. And so the only area that is open is many feet down. So there just really is no place to put parking.

So this, we would have to go to the zoning board after this amendment, but it would allow us to end up with four dwelling units in this property, which is now vacant and just nice or it'll be renovated and made a productive compliant property if we're able to move forward. We have a letter of support. We went through a community process and there was uniform support.

And we have a letter of support from Alderman Thompson and we'd request your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (3:20:53 - 3:21:50)
Thank you, Mr. Moore. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Thompson. Questions for the attorney?

I don't see any hands up. Can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? So moved.

Is that Alderman Hatton again? Alderman Hatton moves to pass. Objections to that?

Hearing none, the item is passed. Now we're at the bottom of page four, document number 20477, 42nd Ward. Ordinance was referred on September 9th of 2020 and its document number is 02020-4452.

Change request, I'm sorry, common address 50 East Huron Street and the change request plan development number 173 to plan development number 173 as amended.

[Speaker 11] (3:21:54 - 3:21:55)
Again, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (3:21:56 - 3:21:57)
Mr. Moore, I'm sorry, Mr. Moore.

[Speaker 11] (3:21:57 - 3:23:46)
Thomas Moore on behalf of the applicant. This is an interesting situation. It was for 50 or 60 years, it was the Illinois Library Association, not-for-profit, so not a taxpayer in a building that they have now vacated.

The applicant wants to have a post-surgical skilled nursing rehab center. So from Northwestern and all the other hospitals around that would do knee surgery, hip surgery, any kind of surgery, and you're in the hospital for a couple of days and the hospital insurance company wants you out, but you're not ready to go home. This is where you would go.

And it's a state-of-the-art, negative air, all sorts of technology to keep any kind of COVID or other germs or any negative health aspects out of the recently surgical patient's atmosphere. And we went through a community process and we also went through the plan commission. The plan evolved somewhat as we went through that process a little bit.

And so we do have a substitute narrative and plan. And then, well, if we could do that, please.

[Speaker 37] (3:23:48 - 3:23:52)
Chairman, I move to accept the substitute narrative and plans, Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 1] (3:23:52 - 3:24:02)
Thank you, Alderman Lopez. But I also, don't we need to incorporate the records of the plan commission first and then do the substitute after that?

[Speaker 11] (3:24:02 - 3:24:03)
Yes, please. Would you please do both?

[Speaker 1] (3:24:04 - 3:24:13)
Okay. So Alderman Lopez, would you move to, first of all, to accept the plans, the records from the plan commission meeting?

[Speaker 37] (3:24:13 - 3:24:15)
I move to accept the plans from the record commission.

[Speaker 1] (3:24:16 - 3:24:41)
Okay. So Alderman Lopez moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that?

Hearing none, the records are incorporated. Now- Confirm with the department that there's substitute narrative and plans. From the, Nicole wants to know if the department has the substitute narrative and plans that Mr. Moore is alluding to.

[Speaker 11] (3:24:42 - 3:24:50)
Yes, we delivered those to ENA and I have them in my hand here.

[Speaker 1] (3:24:50 - 3:24:53)
Well, you're Mr. Moore. I want to hear from the department.

[Speaker 41] (3:24:54 - 3:24:56)
Chairman, can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (3:24:57 - 3:24:58)
Anna, sounds like Anna.

[Speaker 41] (3:24:58 - 3:25:10)
Yes, this is Anna Robles, plan examiner. I did receive the type one substitute narrative plans. However, the Chicago plan commission documents trump that.

[Speaker 1] (3:25:11 - 3:25:22)
Okay, so we don't need to- We don't need to- Okay, so we can keep moving. Okay. All right.

So Mr. Moore, do you have anything more on the presentation?

[Speaker 11] (3:25:23 - 3:25:34)
No, but I'm told that Alderman Riley would be on the call and he's been very supportive and helpful in this process.

[Speaker 1] (3:25:34 - 3:25:40)
And so we'd appreciate- All right, then let's hear from Alderman Riley.

[Speaker 12] (3:25:42 - 3:26:13)
Hi chairman, thank you. Yes, I have no objection to this project. It went through a community process as council mentioned.

Most importantly, their immediate neighbor is a residential condominium building where they had, I think, very productive dialogue to work out some issues of mutual concern. And the neighborhood association of record also has no objection to the project moving forward. So that said, I would encourage a favorable vote.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:26:13 - 3:27:23)
Thank you, Alderman. Questions for the applicant or the Alderman? Hearing none, I need a motion now to pass this item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Can I get a motion? Alderman Cardona. Alderman Cardona moves to pass.

Any objections to that? Hearing none, the item is passed as revised by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. All right, is that it, Mr. Moore?

Yes, thank you very much. All right, have a nice afternoon. All right, top of page five, document number 20530-T1, 48th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on October 7th of 2020. The change request on this one is an RM5 residential multi-unit district to an RM6 multi-unit residential district we hope to have Ted Novak or Liz Butler on the call. I see Liz.

[Speaker 41] (3:27:24 - 3:29:54)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My name is Liz Butler with the law firm of DLA Piper located at 444 West Lake Street in Chicago. I, along with my colleague, Ted Novak, represent the applicant in this matter, the Chicago Title Land Trust as trustee under trust agreement dated November 20th, 30th, 1993.

Who is the owner of the 12-unit residential building located at 5616 North Winthrop Avenue. I'm joined by Dan Manojlovsky on behalf of the applicant. The applicant acquired this building in 1988 and thereafter learned that the building was non-conforming with respect to both the number of dwelling units in the building and the number of accessory parking spaces.

Since that time, the applicant has undertaken several efforts to bring the property into conformance with zoning, including rezoning the property from the RT4 to the RM5 in 2008. That rezoning legalized the number of dwelling units of the property, but the parking remained a non-conforming condition. Based on the one-to-one ratio, 12 parking spaces would be required, but due to the size and historic conditions of the property, only six vehicular parking spaces can physically fit on the site.

The applicant continues to pursue bringing the property into legal conformance status, and that's why we are before you today. The property is located within 250 feet of the red line station at Bryn Mawr, making it eligible for a transit-served parking reduction. So in order to seek that transit-served location parking reduction, we are seeking to rezone the property from the RM5 to the RM6 through a type one.

Only to bring the property into conformance with zoning. No physical changes are proposed to the property or to the building, and this rezoning, of course, will be tied to the plans which are being shown on the screen right now that reflects the existing condition of the building. The applicant presented this request to neighbors at a community meeting that was held in September and discussed the request with the aldermen.

We believe that a letter of support from Alderman Osterman is on file with the committee, and we respectfully request your favorable recommendation of this rezoning. We're available to answer any questions that you might have.

[Speaker 1] (3:29:55 - 3:30:20)
Thank you. Thank you, Liz. I know we do have a letter of support from Alderman Osterman.

Alderman, do you want to say a few words or are you good with just the letter of support? Good with the letter of support. All right.

Thank you. If there are no questions by committee members of the applicant or the alderman, do I have a motion to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 18] (3:30:21 - 3:30:22)
Move to pass, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (3:30:23 - 3:30:33)
Alderman Dowell moves to pass. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Thank you. And Liz, I think that's it, right, for you?

[Speaker 38] (3:30:34 - 3:30:36)
For now, we'll be back.

[Speaker 1] (3:30:36 - 3:31:12)
All right. Thanks. All right.

Middle of page five. Document number 20533-T1, 47th Ward. The ordinance was referred on October 7th of 2020.

The common address of this item is 3333-3335 North Lincoln Avenue and 3336-3338 North Marshfield Avenue. And the change request to B12 Neighborhood Shopping District to a B13 Neighborhood Shopping District. And we have attorney Patrick Turner that will present.

[Speaker 50] (3:31:14 - 3:33:04)
Okay. Hopefully everyone can hear me okay. My name is Patrick Turner with offices at 33 North LaSalle Street in Chicago.

And I do represent the owner of the subject property, which is 3333 Lincoln LLC. The property is located at 3333-35 North Lincoln and 3336-38 North Marshfield. The property is a through lot extending from Lincoln to Marshfield.

The applicant is seeking to rezone the property from its existing B1-2 classification to a B1-3 classification in order to erect a side three-story addition and a rear three-story addition to the existing three-story multi-use building. The rezoning is sought to allow an increase in the maximum floor area ratio for the proposed additions and to reduce the minimum off-street auto parking by 100% as a transit served location. The property is located in close proximity to the Paulina Brown line.

I would like to point out that the plans did change slightly from the original submission and a substitute narrative and plans were delivered to the zoning department and I believe Anna would confirm receipt of those. We also worked with the West Lakeview neighbors and the Lakeview Chamber of Commerce as well as Alderman Martin's office and revised the project and the plans to address their concerns. Alderman Martin has submitted a letter of support and I am available to answer any questions the committee may have.

[Speaker 1] (3:33:05 - 3:33:19)
Okay, Patrick, your testimony alludes to the fact that you have an amendment. I want to hear from the department if they've received it and what they're, because we don't have it on, I don't have it on my records.

[Speaker 6] (3:33:21 - 3:33:35)
Hi chairman, this is Patrick Murphy. Yes, we did get the plans last night. We have not had the chance to go through them.

We would like to know if it's possible that we could defer this to the 15th so we have a chance to review.

[Speaker 50] (3:33:38 - 3:33:52)
If I may, I mean, basically it was, we added a green roof, increased bike parking and on-street bike parking on both Marshfield and Lincoln just at the Alderman's request.

[Speaker 1] (3:33:53 - 3:34:11)
Patrick, I appreciate the change, but if we move it to the 15th, you'll still be able to pass it on the 16th. So it really isn't going to be a time delay if the department turns it around, which I'm sure they will fairly quickly based on what you just said.

[Speaker 50] (3:34:13 - 3:34:15)
Okay, then I would have...

[Speaker 1] (3:34:15 - 3:34:23)
All right, then I'm going to need a motion to defer this item to the next zoning meeting on the 15th. Do I have a motion to defer?

[Speaker 9] (3:34:23 - 3:34:24)
Motion by Alderman David Moore.

[Speaker 1] (3:34:25 - 3:34:30)
Alderman David Moore moves to defer this previously read item. All those in favor?

[Speaker 50] (3:34:31 - 3:34:32)
Aye. Aye.

[Speaker 1] (3:34:33 - 3:34:56)
Any opposed? Hearing no objections, the item has been deferred. Date certain, December 15th.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. All right, thank you, Patrick. We'll see you back then.

Now I'm going to ask our vice chair. Again, we have a 44th board application. Vice chair Roboyes, will you take the chair, please?

[Speaker 47] (3:34:58 - 3:35:43)
Thank you, chairman. Item number 20527-T1 in the 44th ward. Coordinates referred on October 7th, 2020.

Document number 02020-4810. The common address is 3415-25 North Ashland Avenue. The applicant is 3415 Ashland LLC, owner Marvel Electric Corporation.

It is my understanding that we have a substitute before us. So I'd like to move the substitute be accepted by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any, do I, all opposed?

All hearing? All approval?

[Speaker 9] (3:35:45 - 3:35:47)
I'll move by Alderman David Moore.

[Speaker 47] (3:35:47 - 3:35:56)
Alderman David Moore, hearing the substitute is before us. And I will ask the Honorable Rolando Acosta to speak on this matter.

[Speaker 22] (3:35:57 - 3:37:05)
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning, members of the committee.

Rolando, or good afternoon. I'm sorry. You had a long morning.

Good afternoon. Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant. The property before you is along Ashland Avenue on the east side.

It is immediately adjacent to the brown line train, now called the low line in this area. It is a transit oriented property that is proximate both to the Palina stop as well as the south port stop on the brown line. The proposal before you is to demolish the existing building and construct a four-story building with 53 units, 16 parking spaces and 53 bicycle parking spaces, as well as a bicycle amenity that would be immediately adjacent to the low line or the brown line train line.

We have submitted this to the alderman and gone through his community process, made revisions as a result of comments we received, including reducing the height of this building from a five-story to a four-story. And with that, we would be happy to answer any questions that the committee may have.

[Speaker 47] (3:37:08 - 3:37:10)
Alderman Tunney, would you speak on the matter?

[Speaker 1] (3:37:11 - 3:37:42)
Thank you, vice chair. Rolando stated this is a part of Ashland Avenue that abuts the brown line. And it's also surrounded on many sides with a ground floor residential.

This is a shuttered factory site. And as was stated by Rolando, met with the West Lakeview Planning Council and they are in support of this plan. And I ask my colleagues for their support today.

[Speaker 47] (3:37:42 - 3:38:07)
Thank you, Alderman Tunney. Any questions by committee members? There are no questions.

Do I hear a motion to pass in the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? So moved. So moved by Alderman Moore.

All in favor? Aye. All opposed in the opinion of chairs.

The ayes have it. This item is passed.

[Speaker 1] (3:38:08 - 3:38:31)
Thank you, vice chair. Now we're on the top of page six. Item number 20537-T1, 40th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on October 7th of 2020. Common address, 5214-24 North Lincoln Avenue. And 2501-2511 West Farragut Avenue.

[Speaker 22] (3:38:31 - 3:39:58)
Change request, B3-2 Community Shopping District to B2-3 Neighborhood Shopping District. Rolando. Good afternoon again.

Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant. This property is at the southwest corner of Lincoln and Farragut. It consists of 14,500 square feet.

It is currently approved with a long vacant one-story shopping center that is proposed to be demolished and replaced by a five-story building containing 40 units. Actually, it's 42 units with two of those units being business live work units on the ground floor, as well as a commercial space at the very corner. It would contain 24 parking spaces.

It has gone through Alderman Vasquez's community process, including a community meeting. We revised the plans in accordance with the comments received at that meeting to slightly increase the parking from the 20 that originally was proposed to 24. The property is transit oriented to the Western bus line at Western and Foster, which is approximately 800 feet to the southeast of this property.

I believe that the Alderman has submitted a letter of support. And with that, I will answer any questions the committee may have. Rolando, a question from us is, is there a substitute on this?

I'm sorry, there is. There's a substitute narrative and plans. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (3:39:59 - 3:40:15)
Okay. So then Alderman Roboyes moves to accept the substantive narrative plans for the type one application by the same rule that was used to determine quorum. Thank you, Alderman.

All those in favor?

[Speaker 9] (3:40:16 - 3:40:16)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (3:40:18 - 3:40:32)
Any objections? All right. So then the substantive narrative and plans are accepted.

So now we can, now that we have the amendment here, we can vote on it. If you're finished, Rolando.

[Speaker 22] (3:40:34 - 3:40:37)
Yes, Mr. Chairman. Any questions? Are you finished?

I am, thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:40:37 - 3:40:46)
Now we do have a letter of support from Alderman Vasquez. Are there questions for the applicant?

[Speaker 37] (3:40:47 - 3:40:50)
Move to approve as amended, Chairman. Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 1] (3:40:51 - 3:41:45)
Okay. So Alderman Ray Lopez moves to do pass as amended by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that motion?

Hearing none. The item is passed with the substantive narrative and plans. All right.

All right. Now we're in on the first ward, item number 20528-T1. First board, the ordinance was referred on October 7th of 2020.

The common address was 1533 through 1535 West Fry Street. And the change request, RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RM4.5 residential multi-unit district.

[Speaker 22] (3:41:46 - 3:42:56)
Rolando. Once again, Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant. This matter involves two parcels mid-block on Fry Street that are currently approved with two old, rather dilapidated two-story residential buildings.

The applicant is currently zoned RS3. The applicant proposes to demolish the two existing structures and build a four-story building that will contain six dwelling units and six parking spaces. The proposed rezoning is to an RM4.5, which is consistent with the zoning immediately to our West. We went through about a year long community process with the alderman and the immediate neighbors. The proposed building would be virtually identical to those that have been built on this block, including the buildings immediately to our West. As a result of modifications to the plans before even we filed, we have received the alderman's support for this matter.

I believe he has transmitted a letter. There is no substitute in this case, Mr. Chairman. The plans that were filed are the plans that are before you.

[Speaker 1] (3:42:57 - 3:43:00)
Right. Sounds like you had a lot of amendments before you filed to begin with.

[Speaker 22] (3:43:00 - 3:43:01)
Yes, we did.

[Speaker 1] (3:43:02 - 3:43:14)
All right. We do have a letter of support from Alderman LaSpada. No questions by committee members.

Do I hear a motion? Do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

[Speaker 24] (3:43:15 - 3:43:16)
So moved, Alderman Hadden.

[Speaker 1] (3:43:16 - 3:43:29)
That would be Alderman Hadden. Moves do pass. Any objections to that?

Hearing none, the item's passed. Thank you, Rolando. I think we're done with your applications.

Thank you.

[Speaker 22] (3:43:29 - 3:43:30)
Have a great afternoon.

[Speaker 1] (3:43:30 - 3:44:39)
Okay. Now we're on the bottom of page six. Item number 20531-T1, 43rd Ward.

The ordinance was referred on October 7th of 2020. Common address is 2700 North Pine Grove Avenue. And the change request.

RM5, residential multi-unit district to an RM6, residential multi-unit district. Our attorney is Mark Ordoir. I should know that.

But for the members of the committee, this was one of our public speakers that voiced some objection to this. Immediate neighbor, I think, to the south. Just for the record.

Okay. All right. Mark, good afternoon.

Mark, you need to unmute. Mark, good afternoon. I think you need to begin your presentation from the beginning, okay?

[Speaker 55] (3:44:41 - 3:46:20)
Just start over again. Yeah, I'm Mark Ordoir on behalf of the applicant, Second Church of Christ Scientist of Chicago. And this request involves a church that has been here for 120 years at 2700 North Pine Grove.

Their needs have changed over the years. And in order to accommodate the church, there'll be substantial renovations. And their configuration of their worship space will be somewhat smaller.

But in the building, three of the sides of the building will remain exactly as they are, including the front entrance to the church. And there will be a seven-story, 26-unit building erected as an addition. And we went through a community process.

We met with the Park West Association. Alderman Smith sponsored a neighborhood meeting. And we, at that point, obtained the support of the alderman.

And I believe she will address you after I do. And I do have my development team here and owners of the church, if there are any questions from the committee. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:46:22 - 3:46:28)
Thank you, Mark. And let's hear from Alderman Michelle Smith.

[Speaker 24] (3:46:29 - 3:46:31)
Just a minute here.

[Speaker 1] (3:46:31 - 3:46:33)
The 43rd Ward, yeah. Michelle?

[Speaker 24] (3:46:35 - 3:46:36)
Can you see me?

[Speaker 1] (3:46:37 - 3:46:40)
I don't know if I can see you, but I can certainly hear you.

[Speaker 24] (3:46:40 - 3:47:53)
Okay. Well, oh, no, wait. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

Okay, here I am. There you are. Okay.

So this was a project on Pine Grove of the Second Church of Christ scientists. And the congregation has dwindled. And we went through a several-year community process to try to handle the church and how we could preserve it.

So this is the best proposal that we got after a several-year process in which the church will remain at the front of this Beeman building, is the name of the architect, with a building going up sort of inside of it and to the back of it. This parcel was originally zoned R6. And in an effort to make sure we had a community process on this, we rezoned it to R5, which is this church is way over that zoning right now.

So we think that this is a good compromise. We had a very, very extensive community process. And I would like to ask for the support of the committee on the project.

[Speaker 1] (3:47:54 - 3:48:14)
Thank you, Alderman. Michelle Smith. I'm gonna have a question, but I'll see if any of my colleagues have a question.

All right. So Michelle, as your neighbor, of course, I'm very familiar with the property. What percent of this church is actually going to be retained?

[Speaker 24] (3:48:15 - 3:49:34)
Well, actually a lot more than under the first proposal that we got. So the front interior of it, the front and the three street facades, the fourth was always just a back to a parking lot, are gonna be retained. And in addition, the front, if you've been in the church, foyer is gonna be retained, which was not the case in many proposals that we have.

And that space is gonna be reused for the actual worship area and office area for the church. So all of that interior space is being retained. What will be lost is the dome of the church, because that's gonna be reconfigured into apartments.

And then, and the new building will be, I can't, a couple of stories taller than the existing church. So that will be gone and there will be an extension of that building into what is now the church's parking lot, which will be converted into a combination of, I think there's a floor of underground parking and ground level parking will be part of it. So from the street, it won't be very different.

All right. Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (3:49:35 - 3:49:44)
Was this building ever orange rated? I mean, we spent the morning on landmarking. It's, but it was this building and this was not a landmark building, right?

[Speaker 24] (3:49:44 - 3:49:58)
No, no. And there wasn't really fair support for doing so. The church needs the funds in order to operate their facilities.

So this was not landmark.

[Speaker 1] (3:49:58 - 3:50:07)
Okay, other questions from committee members? Hearing none, can I get a motion? Move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

[Speaker 15] (3:50:11 - 3:50:12)
Moved by Alderman Villegas.

[Speaker 4] (3:50:12 - 3:50:18)
Alderman Villegas moves to pass. Any objections? Mr. Chairman, record me as no on this matter.

[Speaker 1] (3:50:19 - 3:50:44)
Okay, all right. So we have a no vote on this by Alderman Hopkins. Any other, otherwise I'm going to record him as the only no on this and pass it with the rest of us.

No objection to that. Okay, so it's passed. Noting that Alderman Hopkins will be voting no on it.

Thank you, Michelle. Okay.

[Speaker 24] (3:50:44 - 3:50:46)
Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.

[Speaker 1] (3:50:47 - 3:51:23)
Okay, top of page seven. Document number 20523, 38th Ward. Ordinance was referred on October 7th of 2020.

And the common address is 6340 West Irving Park Road. If you're looking copiously at the denim, it's West Irving Park Road. Change request B3-1 Community Shopping District to a B2-2 Neighborhood Mixed Use District.

And we have Paul Kolpak on this one. Paul?

[Speaker 16] (3:51:23 - 3:52:13)
Hi, good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. I represent the applicant in this matter. As you mentioned, the property is currently zoned B3-1.

Proposed zoning changes out of B2-2. Current use of the property was an existing tavern and bar that's been vacant for a number of years. The purpose of the zoning change is to allow the first floor to be utilized for residential and to perhaps allow a second dwelling unit on the second floor.

We met with the aldermen. We have a letter of support. We have not had any calls to my office regarding any objections from any of the neighbors.

If I'm prepared to answer any questions we may have. All right, thank you, Paul.

[Speaker 1] (3:52:14 - 3:52:24)
Questions from committee members or the applicants? Hearing none, can I get a motion? Do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

[Speaker 37] (3:52:24 - 3:52:26)
So moved, Alderman Lopez, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (3:52:26 - 3:53:05)
Alderman Raymond Lopez moves do pass. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

All right. Thank you, everybody. Be healthy.

Thank you. You do the same. Now, on the middle of page seven, there is a request by the attorney to defer this item number 20516, 32nd Ward.

The ordinance was referred on October 7th. This is on Webster and Alston intersections. Can I get a motion to defer the previously read item?

[Speaker 18] (3:53:06 - 3:53:08)
So moved, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (3:53:08 - 3:54:00)
That is Alderman Dowell, I believe, makes the motion to defer the previously read item. All those in favor? Aye.

Aye. Any opposed? So hearing no objections, the item will be deferred.

All right, bottom of page seven, document number 20526-T1, the 28th Ward. The ordinance was referred on October 7th of 2020. This common address is 1549 West Roosevelt Road and also 1201 South Ashland Avenue.

Change request. C13, neighborhood commercial district and RT4, residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district to a C11 neighborhood commercial district. We have our attorney, Tyler Manick.

[Speaker 59] (3:54:01 - 3:55:10)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon, members of the committee. My name is Tyler Manick of Shane Banks, Kenyon Schwartz.

I'm here on behalf of the applicant, Roosevelt Operations Inc. Relative to the property located 1549 West Roosevelt and 1201 South Ashland. On the property there currently exists a legal non-conforming gas station due to its location in a split lot of RT4 residential two flat townhouse multi-unit district and a C13 neighborhood commercial district.

The applicant seeks to rezone the entire parcel to a C11 neighborhood commercial district in order to bring this lot into a conforming zoning district which would allow the applicant to remodel and improve the existing gas station and bring it up to modern standards. Prior to filing this application, the applicant has worked with Alderman Irvin in the design of this project. And Alderman Irvin has given this committee his letter of support which should be on file with the committee.

With the support of the Alderman, I respectfully request this committee's favorable recommendation of approval and I'd be happy to answer any questions about this project.

[Speaker 1] (3:55:11 - 3:55:26)
Thank you, Tyler. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Irvin. Questions by committee members?

No, hearing no questions, do I have a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 37] (3:55:27 - 3:55:28)
So moved chairman, Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 1] (3:55:29 - 3:55:37)
Alderman Raymond Lopez to pass. Any objections to that? Hearing none, the item is passed.

All right.

[Speaker 59] (3:55:37 - 3:55:38)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (3:55:39 - 3:56:03)
Thank you, Tyler. Top of page eight, document number 20524, 26th Ward, the ordinance was referred on October 7th of 2020. Common address, 3224 West North Avenue and the change request, a B3-2 community shopping district to a B2-2 neighborhood mixed use district.

We have Mark Kupiak. Mark?

[Speaker 36] (3:56:03 - 3:57:16)
Yes, Mr. Chairman. Mark Kupiak here, attorney for the applicant. As you said, property 3224 West North Avenue and brief history.

The applicant's family actually has owned the Rosers Bakery, located a couple of doors down, same side of the street for over a hundred years. The applicant has owned the building on a subject property for 20 years and he used to operate a business in the store on the ground floor of the existing building. The last tenant of that store moved out last year.

The applicant who's very familiar with the neighborhood does not believe he can get a replacement tenant for that storefront. So the request is the rezoning to allow him to convert that old storefront to an additional apartment. It's an old building, expensive to keep up and maintain and the rent from the apartment would help him and allow him to do so.

With that, he's worked with the Alderman for some time to discuss this project, explain his problem and ask for the Alderman's support. And I believe you have a letter of support that was sent to you on this matter.

[Speaker 1] (3:57:17 - 3:57:23)
Mark, we do have a letter of support from Alderman Maldonado on this project.

[Speaker 36] (3:57:23 - 3:57:25)
With that, I ask for your support.

[Speaker 1] (3:57:26 - 3:57:45)
Thank you. Have any questions from committee members? Can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine- All move, Mr. Chairman. That is Alderman Roboyes. Moves do pass. Any objections?

Hearing none, the item is passed.

[Speaker 59] (3:57:46 - 3:57:47)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:57:47 - 3:58:18)
All right. Now we're moving to the middle of page eight, document number 20529T1, 12th Ward. The ordinance was referred on October 7th of 2020.

Common address is 3473 through 3477 South Archer Avenue. The change request RS3, residential single unit detached house district to a B33 community shopping district.

[Speaker 36] (3:58:19 - 3:59:45)
Mark Kupiec. Mr. Chairman, thank you. Mark Kupiec, I'm the attorney for the applicant for this property at 3473-77 South Archer Avenue.

And the subject property, I would note by way of introduction, years ago, this particular property was owned commercial, just like the other buildings on this block. Also years ago, there was a tavern on the first floor of this building of the existing building on the property. And some years ago, the property tavern went out of business and the property was down zoned.

It was down zoned to the current R3 zoning district. The building is still there. We've got apartments on the upper floors, but the commercial space on the first floor is existing.

The applicant bought the property, applied for a permit to remodel that first floor space, but could not get the permit because of the residential zoning. The zoning change would allow him to remodel the first floor and then rent out the first floor units. At the Alderman's request, we did do a community meeting, a Zoom meeting.

The applicant answered the questions presented at that meeting. There were some follow-up questions afterwards and he answered those questions all relayed to the Alderman and asked the Alderman for his support. And I believe on this one that you do also have a letter from the Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (3:59:45 - 3:59:50)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Cardenas.

[Speaker 36] (3:59:51 - 3:59:53)
So with that, I ask for your support.

[Speaker 1] (3:59:54 - 4:00:01)
And I see Alderman Cardenas is on the call. Alderman, would you like to say a few words before we get committee members?

[Speaker 58] (4:00:02 - 4:01:15)
You know what? I do want to make a comment on this particular project. I appreciate the developer and obviously Mark Lupia bringing this forward.

This was a property that had been dilapidated for many, many years. And I just will tell my colleagues the supposing kinds of down zoning. This area was down zoned when Pat Hills was the Alderman, used to be the 11th floor.

And the property owners could really not do anything with it since it was an RS3 and there was multiple units in that building. So now we're up zoning and the rehabbing the 10 units that are there right now. The community thought it was just a great thing that have happened this building again.

Has seen better days. And not only that, but there's going to be a retail at the bottom. Even so in the middle of a pandemic, there's hope that we put coffee shops, some retail at the bottom.

And McKinley Park is an up and coming neighborhood and it was voted by Willow, one of the surging communities in the city of Chicago. So I urge my colleagues to support this and help to bring many items like this in the future. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (4:01:15 - 4:01:23)
Thank you, Alderman. Questions for the Alderman? I see Alderman Raymond Lopez has his hand up.

[Speaker 37] (4:01:24 - 4:01:30)
Thank you, Chairman. Actually, this message is for either our colleague or Mark. Mark, good afternoon.

[Speaker 36] (4:01:31 - 4:01:31)
Good afternoon.

[Speaker 37] (4:01:32 - 4:01:35)
Building on the corner of Archer or the one right next to it?

[Speaker 36] (4:01:37 - 4:01:49)
Well, it's the building right on the corner of Archer and 35th street. And going from that tip there's a couple of two, three different commercial spaces in that building. So it's the entire building.

[Speaker 37] (4:01:50 - 4:02:06)
Got it. Okay. I think it's great and commend my colleague that corner has a lot of great vitality connected to it on 35th street.

So I think this would be a welcome addition for that area to put some light back into that corner. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (4:02:07 - 4:02:42)
Thank you. Other questions, comments? Can I get a motion?

Move to pass the roll call that was used to determine quorum. Move to pass. Who is that?

Cardenas. No, we're going to have Roboius do pass on that item. All those in favor of the motion by Alderman Roboius to approve based on the roll call to determine quorum.

[Speaker 61] (4:02:43 - 4:02:44)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (4:02:44 - 4:03:23)
Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed. All right.

Thank you, aldermens. Now we're on the bottom of page 8 in the 42nd ward, document number 20480. The ordinance was referred on September 9th of 2020.

This comment address is 601 through 611 West Randolph. Change request, DX7, downtown mixed-use district to a business plan development. We have Katrina McGuire on the line.

Hi, Katrina. Would you like to present on this item?

[Speaker 61] (4:03:28 - 4:03:30)
I think you're muted.

[Speaker 57] (4:03:31 - 4:03:55)
Apologies. I've had a nickel for every time. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. I am here today on behalf of the owner and applicant of the subject property at 601 through 611 West Randolph. This matter was heard by the Planning Commission on October 15th, 2020, and the commission recommended approval. Accordingly, we would request that the record of the proceedings before the Planning Commission be incorporated herein.

[Speaker 1] (4:03:58 - 4:04:11)
All right. So Alderman Ravois moves to incorporate the records from the Planning Commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that?

Omo. Hearing none, the records are now incorporated. Katrina, continue.

[Speaker 57] (4:04:12 - 4:05:01)
Thank you. Just very briefly, the project consists of a 15-story office building, which will replace the surface parking lot. The corner building, the 601 West Randolph building, is orange-rated and will remain intact and continue to operate as an office building.

The project intends to utilize the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund bonus and will pay a little over $1 million into that fund. The development team worked closely with Alderman Riley and DPD to modify and fine-tune the project, including reducing the height of the building, pulling the office tower back off of the 601 West Randolph structure, and eliminating parking, thereby eliminating curb cuts along Randolph Street. We are certainly appreciative of Alderman Riley's time on this project.

I understand he is present today, and the team is available for any questions that the committee might have. Alderman Brenda Riley.

[Speaker 12] (4:05:01 - 4:05:39)
Thank you, Chairman. Just wanted to confirm that this did go through a community process. I want to thank the department for their help in negotiating, I think, a good final product that respects the historic building that holds the corner.

And I know that generally the feedback we've received from the neighborhood has been favorable. And as was mentioned, this will eliminate curb cuts on Randolph Street, which is a pedestrian street. So there's a benefit to that as well.

So that said, I have no objections to the project, and I would encourage my colleagues to give it their capable consideration.

[Speaker 1] (4:05:41 - 4:06:03)
Thank you, Alderman. Questions for the Alderman or the applicant? My only comment, being a member of the Planning Commission, I believe, Katrina, that it was imperative that the corner building be retained in its original size and stature, correct?

[Speaker 57] (4:06:04 - 4:06:08)
Yes, and that is the intention, absolutely. And the plan development will ensure that.

[Speaker 1] (4:06:08 - 4:06:27)
Yeah. Very well. OK.

So can I get a motion to move? We've already incorporated the records from the Planning Commission. So I get a motion to move this item as revised by the same roll call that determined quorum.

[Speaker 23] (4:06:27 - 4:06:28)
So moved.

[Speaker 1] (4:06:29 - 4:07:25)
That is Alderman Roboius moves a do pass on the item as revised. Any objections to that? Hearing no objections, this item is passed as revised.

Thank you. Thank you. OK, now we're on the top of page 9, document number 20532-T1, 26th Ward.

The ordinance was referred on October 7th of 2020. This common address is 2815 through 2821 West Division Street. Change request, an RS3, residential single unit detached house district, to an RM6, residential multi-unit district.

We have Nick Fatikas, I believe, on the call as the attorney. Nick? Oh, no.

It looks like Daniel. I'm sorry.

[Speaker 43] (4:07:26 - 4:08:36)
Not a problem. Not a problem at all, Mr. Chairman. Good morning, and members of the committee.

For the record, my name is Daniel Box. I'm an attorney with the Law Offices of Sam Banks, located at 221 North LaSalle. I'm here today on behalf of the applicant, 2815 Division LLC.

The applicant is the owner of the subject property, located at 2815 through 21 West Division Street. The property is improved with a three-story, 26-unit, non-conforming residential building. The applicant is seeking to permit one additional dwelling unit within the existing building, for a total of 27 units at the subject property.

No changes are proposed to the height, setbacks, or footprints of the existing building. No on-site parking is or will be provided at the property. In order to permit the project and to bring the existing building into compliance with the current zoning ordinance, the applicant is seeking a zoning change from an RS3, residential single unit detached house district, to an RM6, residential multi-unit district.

We have worked with the local community and Alderman Maldonado on this project. A letter of support, I believe, should already be on file with your office. And with that, I'd be happy to answer any questions that you might have.

[Speaker 1] (4:08:38 - 4:09:04)
Daniel, we do have a letter of support from Alderman Maldonado. Questions from committee members? Daniel, I just want, for the record, it's just, it seems like it's a very big jump.

I know it's an existing building, but you're saying it's contextual with the surrounding area? What is it? Or is it more of a multi-unit area of West Division?

[Speaker 43] (4:09:04 - 4:09:21)
Yeah, it's certainly consistent with Division Street. There are several multi-unit buildings located on that stretch. And as I said, the building is currently 26 units as it stands.

It's currently non-conforming. So we're simply asking for the additional unit.

[Speaker 1] (4:09:21 - 4:09:37)
No, I get it. I just, I'm not that familiar with the context of it. And why it's an R3 is beyond discussion today, but it does fit in conformity with a lot of the other buildings over there.

[Speaker 43] (4:09:37 - 4:09:38)
Yes, absolutely.

[Speaker 1] (4:09:38 - 4:09:41)
Okay, other questions? Committee members?

[Speaker 37] (4:09:42 - 4:09:43)
Move to pass, Chairman. Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 1] (4:09:44 - 4:10:35)
As I said, we do have a letter of support from Alderman Maldonado. Alderman Raymond Lopez moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that motion?

Hearing none, the item is passed. Thank you. All right, now we're gonna stick with you, Daniel, I believe, on item number 20263-T1, 27th Ward.

The ordinance was referred on November 13th of 19. And it's been a while, okay. The common address is 862 through 868 North Orleans Street.

The change request is a C12 Neighborhood Commercial District to a DX7 Downtown Mixed Use District. Okay, let's talk on what's happening on Orleans or potentially. Oh, we have Nick.

[Speaker 49] (4:10:35 - 4:10:38)
Oh, yeah, substituting in, thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (4:10:38 - 4:10:40)
I didn't know you had a beard, and then you do have it, now you don't.

[Speaker 49] (4:10:41 - 4:11:44)
Okay, all right. For the record, again, Nick Fitikas from the Law Offices of Sam Banks. I'm here on behalf of the property owner, the Pryor Management Group, LLC.

The owner is proposing to develop the current surface parking lot with a nine-story, 66-key hotel. The ground floor will have a residential, I'm sorry, the ground floor will have a retail space, ideally set for a restaurant use, a lobby, and then the keys for the hotel will be on floors two through nine. We've initially proposed this as a type one zoning change in working with the planning department.

We amended that to pursue a plan development. So, and that application as a plan development was reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission back on October 15th of 2020. And I'd ask that the record from the proceeding be incorporated into today's proceeding as well.

[Speaker 1] (4:11:46 - 4:11:49)
So Nick, would first of all have to accept the substitute?

[Speaker 49] (4:11:50 - 4:11:59)
Yes, sir. So it started, it was introduced as a type one zoning change. Right.

And then it was subsequently amended to a plan development proposal.

[Speaker 1] (4:12:01 - 4:12:28)
So what are we doing? Oh, so accept the substitute. So Alderman Rabois moves to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections to that? So move. All right, hearing none, the substitute is accepted.

Now we have to incorporate the records, right? Okay. So Alderman Rabois moves to incorporate the records from the Planning Commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

[Speaker 47] (4:12:29 - 4:12:30)
So move, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (4:12:31 - 4:12:42)
Any objections to that? So now the records are incorporated. The substitute, everything is somewhat kosher.

So let's keep going.

[Speaker 49] (4:12:42 - 4:13:01)
Great, so again, we worked for over a year with Alderman Burnett's office, as well as the Near North Unity Program. Again, we believe we have their support today to proceed with the application. I would be happy to answer any questions you or the committee members have about the proposal.

[Speaker 1] (4:13:02 - 4:13:05)
Okay, Alderman Walter Burnett.

[Speaker 20] (4:13:05 - 4:14:19)
Walter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. As the councilor said, they did meet with the Near North Unity Program.

We had a community meeting almost a year ago, if I'm not mistaken, and the community approved it. Coincidentally, one of the owners of this establishment lives in the community, and they actually started out with a bed and breakfast at their home. And now they're taking a leap and trying to do something else.

And the community supported wholeheartedly. Matter of fact, the community supported their bed and breakfast. They always open their home up to everyone in the neighborhood.

The husband is an ex-police officer. This is a great development. We had a community meeting, everyone approved it.

Planning decided that it needed to be a planned development. So that's why it's taken so long to get back here. And with that, I ask that we move, that the committee support this project.

I support it, the community support it. We ask for the committee's support. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (4:14:19 - 4:14:22)
Thank you, Alderman. Questions for the applicant or the Alderman?

[Speaker 12] (4:14:23 - 4:14:32)
Chairman, Tony Alderman-Riley has a question. Alderman Riley. Thank you, Chairman.

What are the specific addresses for this site?

[Speaker 49] (4:14:33 - 4:14:48)
So the address range is 862 to 868 North Orleans on the west side of Orleans, just past River North.

[Speaker 12] (4:14:49 - 4:15:00)
Got it. And this question may be for Alderman Burnett, but was the River North Residence Associated a part of the community process for this project?

[Speaker 20] (4:15:02 - 4:15:24)
Generally, the River North Association attends the New North Unity Program meetings. So they've been engaged with all of the things that we have going on over there. And did they express any concerns about this project?

Not that I know of, did they, Nick?

[Speaker 49] (4:15:24 - 4:15:53)
No, at our open community meeting about a year ago, we were unanimously approved by approximately 60 voting members. And then we actually hosted a follow-up virtual meeting about three months ago. There was one dissenting vote from a local resident.

The remaining, I believe, 30 or 35 people that participated voted in support. So we believe we have strong community support to move forward.

[Speaker 12] (4:15:54 - 4:15:58)
Okay, thanks for answering my questions. Thank you, Chairman. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (4:15:59 - 4:16:41)
Any other questions from committee members? Well, I just want to comment. You'll have a very big bed and breakfast with 60 units.

It's a big leap. Especially since you've been working on this for a year and a half, the world's changed as far as the hotel business is concerned. So I wish you guys good luck.

And I'm gonna ask for the motion moved to pass by the roll call that was used to approve the determined quorum on this one. I get a motion. So moved by Alderman Austin.

Alderman Kerry Austin moves to pass. Any objections to that motion? Hearing none, the item is passed as amended and revised.

[Speaker 49] (4:16:42 - 4:16:43)
Very much.

[Speaker 1] (4:16:44 - 4:17:22)
All right, we're moving on with you, Nick. It looks like you're in document number 20504, 47th Ward. The ordinance was referred on September 9th of 2020.

The common address of this one is 1755 West Cornelia Avenue. The change request, an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RT4 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district. Nick?

Thanks, Daniel. Oh, you can't do this to me. All right, Daniel, sorry.

[Speaker 43] (4:17:22 - 4:18:28)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I appreciate your putting up with our musical chairs over here. Once again, for the record, my name is Daniel Box.

I'm an attorney with the Law Offices of Sam Banks. I'm here today on behalf of the applicant, Stafford and Lockwood LTD. The applicant is the owner of the subject property located at 1755 West Cornelia Avenue.

The property is improved with a two-story single family home with a detached garage at the rear of the lot. The applicant is seeking to permit a new three-story, three-unit residential building at the subject property. To do so, the applicant will raise the existing structures.

The proposed building will measure 38 feet in height and onsite surface parking for three cars will be provided at the lot's rear. In order to permit the project, the applicant is seeking a zoning change from an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RT4 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district. We have worked with the local community and with Alderman Martin on this project.

A letter of support should already be on file. And with that, I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have.

[Speaker 1] (4:18:31 - 4:18:49)
All right, we have questions for the applicant. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Martin on this one. Hearing no questions by committee members, can I get a motion moved to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 37] (4:18:49 - 4:18:51)
I move Chairman Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 1] (4:18:51 - 4:19:04)
Alderman Raymond Lopez moves to pass. Any objections to that motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

All right, I think we're done with both of you.

[Speaker 43] (4:19:05 - 4:19:06)
I think so.

[Speaker 1] (4:19:07 - 4:19:38)
You never know, you never know. All right, top of page 10, item number 20536, 24th Ward. The ordinance was referred on October 7th of 2020.

This common address is 1114 South Holman Avenue in the church request. It's a B32 Community Shopping District to a C12 Neighborhood Commercial District. And yeah, Graham Grady is the attorney.

Good afternoon, Graham.

[Speaker 26] (4:19:39 - 4:22:13)
Good afternoon, Chairman Toney and members of the committee. Graham Grady with the law firm of Taft, Stettinius, and Hollister, along with my co-counsel, Sylvia Micas. In addition, available for questions is Brenda Palms Barber, the Executive Director of the North Longdale Employment Network and the Executive Director of Sweet Beginnings Cafe.

And also Larry Kearns, who is a principal with the architectural firm of Wheeler Kearns Architects. First of all, Chairman, I'd like to thank extensively, profusely Alderman Scott for his assistance, as well as the staff of the Department of Planning and Development who've contributed to this application. This is a single lot, 3,041 square feet, which has been vacant for decades and unimproved for a long, long time.

The proposal here is to rezone the property in order to allow the establishment of an outdoor urban farm and accessory uses, which will consist of an apiary in which bees will naturally produce honey for use in the North Longdale Employment Network's Sweet Beginnings Cafe bee love projects. As you can see in this slide, there will be an attractive perimeter fence along with a seating area for workers, but also, and very importantly, the beehives or the apiary on site. There will also be a small utility building and a place to park vehicles.

Basically, they harvest honey here, as well as from other sites around the city. They take it across the street into a location that was rezoned in Plan Development 177 a few months ago, and they make wonderfully popular honey-based products. We have reached out to the surrounding property owners, and in fact, we have a very strong letter of support from Mr. John O'Meara and his wife who own the property immediately south, which is a two-flat, and they strongly support this project and the NLEN program. We have additional support from other community members, one of whom was unable to participate in the public commentary period. Mr. Chairman and members, we are unaware of any opposition, and we request the support of the committee to rezone this property, to put it to active use in the job training program for the Sweet Beginnings program with the North Lawndale Employment Network for their job creation and the creation of honey-based products. I'd be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (4:22:14 - 4:22:21)
Thank you, Graham. I think we have, is Alderman Michael Scott? I think this is Michael's ward, Michael.

[Speaker 58] (4:22:22 - 4:22:22)
He's here.

[Speaker 1] (4:22:23 - 4:22:28)
I know you're effusive about these projects, Michael, but we have a long agenda, so, you know.

[Speaker 16] (4:22:29 - 4:22:30)
Real quick.

[Speaker 21] (4:22:32 - 4:22:57)
Hopefully, this is the last time I come before the body for a zoning change or anything else. North Lawndale Employment Network, great in our community, done great things. And this zoning change will allow, you know, just what Graham said, them to be able to manufacture honey on site.

We've had several community meetings about the entire project, about the zoning, and everybody has been supportive, and I urge the body to be supportive as well. Thank you, Mr. Chair.

[Speaker 1] (4:22:58 - 4:23:02)
Thank you, Alderman Scott. We do have a question from Alderman Ray Lopez.

[Speaker 37] (4:23:04 - 4:23:16)
Thank you, Chairman. I want to commend and congratulate Alderman Scott on this, but I did have a question as to why you would have to change the zoning if it's basically just bees in a honeycomb.

[Speaker 26] (4:23:17 - 4:23:50)
Yeah, Alderman Lopez, I appreciate the question. The urban, the outdoor urban farm is only permitted in the commercial zoning districts. An urban outdoor farm is not allowed in the business zoning districts.

So we need to upgrade it from a B zone to a C zone. And so that's why we're changing the zoning. And it's because it's a processing use.

The urban outdoor farm is viewed as more of a commercial type use rather than a business use.

[Speaker 1] (4:23:52 - 4:23:53)
Got it, okay, thank you.

[Speaker 26] (4:23:54 - 4:23:55)
Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (4:23:55 - 4:24:00)
Any other questions from committee members for the Alderman or Mr. Graham?

[Speaker 26] (4:24:01 - 4:24:03)
Chairman Toney, thank you and members, thank you.

[Speaker 1] (4:24:04 - 4:24:10)
All right, well, let me get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

[Speaker 24] (4:24:10 - 4:24:12)
So moved, Alderwoman Hatton.

[Speaker 1] (4:24:12 - 4:24:34)
Alderwoman Hatton moves, makes that motion to move do pass on it. Any objections to the motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Congratulations both to the Alderman, I know to the Lawndale Employment Network. I've, you know, pretty exciting stuff in Alderman Scott's ward. So congratulations to all of you.

[Speaker 26] (4:24:35 - 4:24:38)
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, buddy. Thank you, Chairman Scott.

[Speaker 1] (4:24:38 - 4:24:48)
All right, now we're in the, let's see, we're in the middle of page 10. Who's making the move? Who's the deferred?

[Speaker 24] (4:24:48 - 4:24:48)
For the Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (4:24:49 - 4:25:22)
Okay, so there's a, and who is the Alderman? Scott. Okay, all right.

So item number 20463, 24th Ward. The ordinance was referred on July 22nd of 2020. This address is 2100 South Pulaski Road.

The change request B3-2 Community Shopping District to B2-3 Neighborhood Mixed Use District. At the request of Alderman Michael Scott, he would like to defer it. So I'm gonna need a motion to defer this previously read item.

[Speaker 58] (4:25:23 - 4:25:24)
So moved, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (4:25:24 - 4:26:22)
Is that Alderman Ray Lopez? Alderman Raymond Lopez makes the motion to defer the previously read item. All in favor?

Aye. Aye. Any opposed?

Hearing no objection, the item has been deferred. All right, we're now on the bottom of page 10. Item number 20522, 21st Ward.

Ordinance was referred on October 7th of 2020. And the common address of this application is 9040 through 9044 South Halstead Street. The change request M12 Limited Manufacturing Business Park District to an M21 Light Industry District.

I have Adam Kingsley as the attorney. Adam?

[Speaker 15] (4:26:23 - 4:27:01)
Good afternoon, Chairman. I apologize for my lighting. I appear to be a little bit in the dark here.

But anyway, you've got the address correctly. It's 9040 to 9044 South Halstead Street. I represent the owner, William Spencer.

This change from M11 to M21 is designed to allow the operation of a used car sales lot. The property is currently majority vacant and paved. There's a small building on there that's used for inspections.

So that will also be used for the used car lot. And I'm happy to answer any questions anybody may have.

[Speaker 1] (4:27:01 - 4:27:03)
All right, thank you.

[Speaker 15] (4:27:04 - 4:27:08)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Brookins, by the way.

[Speaker 1] (4:27:08 - 4:28:05)
Yeah, I thought the Alderman might have been on the call, but I think he left us. Okay, all right. Well, we do have a letter of support from Alderman Brookins on this application.

Any questions by committee members? Can I get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine? So moved by Alderman Austin.

Alderman Kerry Austin moves do pass. Any objections to that motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

All right, thank you very much. Thank you. And now we're gonna be on the middle of page 11, document number 20534, Second Ward.

Ordinance was referred on October 7th of 2020. This common address, 22 East Elm Street, and the change request, a DR7 Downtown Residential District to a DX7 Downtown Mixed Use District.

[Speaker 9] (4:28:07 - 4:28:09)
Sarah, have a seat.

[Speaker 1] (4:28:10 - 4:28:14)
Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Can you present this to the committee, please?

[Speaker 3] (4:28:15 - 4:29:39)
Absolutely, good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Sarah Barnes, and I'm an attorney with the lobsters of Sam Banks. I'm happy to be here this afternoon on behalf of the applicant, DITA LLC, which is owned by Bianca Timbota Bella and her husband, as a matter of procedural background, Mr. Chairman, before I continue with the details of the proposal, I would like to advise the committee that as a result of our ongoing work with the aldermen and the local community organizations, we recently amended the ordinance to reflect a less intense zoning designation, and also, and that's the designation from a DX, or sorry, a DR7 to a DX3, as opposed to a DX7.

As well, we recently converted the application to a voluntary type one amendment. Copies of the relevant documents evidencing these changes were tendered to the Department of Planning and Development prior to this hearing. As such, I respectfully request that the substitute ordinance and the corresponding type one zoning narrative and architectural plans, please be adopted into the record here today, and any votes taken herein be on those documents.

[Speaker 1] (4:29:42 - 4:29:50)
Alderman Roboius moves to amend this application to a type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

[Speaker 47] (4:29:50 - 4:29:51)
So moved, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (4:29:51 - 4:30:13)
Any objections to that motion? So now, hearing none, the item is amended to a type one application. Now we've got another motion here?

Yes. Okay. Substitute ordinance.

All right, Alderman Roboius then moves to accept the substitute, or asking him to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

[Speaker 47] (4:30:13 - 4:30:14)
So moved, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (4:30:15 - 4:30:28)
And thank you for that motion. Any objections to the motion by Alderman Roboius? Hearing none, the substitute is accepted.

So I think we're good to keep moving on this one. Sarah?

[Speaker 61] (4:30:28 - 4:30:29)
I think that's good procedurally.

[Speaker 3] (4:30:29 - 4:34:03)
Thank you so much. Towards that end, this case is a little unique, especially in that it's occurring in one of the downtown districts. The applicant is seeking the zoning map amendment in order to permit the reestablishment of a commercial use within the first floor and the basement of the existing two-story building at the subject site.

Coincidentally, in this particular case, the proposed commercial use is a salon and day spa that will be owned, managed, and operated by Ms. Timbota Bella and her husband. Coincidentally, the applicant already owns and operates a similar salon and day spa just down the street within the Gold Coast neighborhood that she's operating pursuant to a lease. Unfortunately, even during the times of COVID when this industry has been hit so disastrously with the impact of the shutdown, her landlord has increased her rent, making it impossible for her to maintain a residency at her current commercial space.

As such, the zoning map amendment will allow the applicant to reestablish, again, that salon, to get licensed that salon and day spa within the first floor and the basement of the existing two-story building at the site. And then it will also allow for the build-out of the second floor, which now is part of a single-family home, to into an apartment or a condominium where she's gonna reside with her husband and their young baby and continue to grow their family. So this will be essentially a live-work type of building where the salon will be located on the lower level and there will be a condo where the applicant will reside with her family.

Oddly enough, the building previously contained several different commercial uses over time, including a salon at one time, and then only recently was deconverted into a single-family residence that was never actually occupied. So we're kind of just taking it back to what it used to be. Towards that end, we have worked very diligently and closely with Alderman Hopkins, as well as several of the local impacted community organizations, including the Gold Coast Residence Association and the Neighboring Homeowners Association, as well the applicant herself, even in the cold weather, had tipped the streets quite literally and talked to different residents and business owners in the neighborhood about the proposal, and actually was able to obtain over 30 letters of support for the proposal. And then based on the other considerations that I described to the committee that were more procedural in nature, we do have the support of all of the community organizations, affected community organizations, as well as Alderman Hopkins, who has memorialized his support in a letter, which was tendered to the committee prior to this hearing. I'm not sure if Alderman Hopkins is still- Well, we have a letter.

[Speaker 1] (4:34:04 - 4:34:04)
We have a letter.

[Speaker 3] (4:34:05 - 4:34:21)
You know, that's a long narrative for the establishment of a pre-existing- It's just so odd because of the high intensity of the downtown zoning. And believe it or not, Alderman, this went through a lot of scrutiny.

[Speaker 1] (4:34:21 - 4:35:08)
Oh, no, I don't envy Alderman Hopkins on this one, but I want to hear from him, okay? Alderman Hopkins, are you on the call? Well, he's not, but we do have a letter of support that was tended to our committee.

So, with that, do we have questions from committee members on this application? If not, can I get a motion to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum, and we're asking to be passed that was substituted and amended to the type one. I'll move.

Motion on that one. Is that Alderman Ray Lopez on that one?

[Speaker 61] (4:35:08 - 4:35:08)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (4:35:09 - 4:35:14)
Okay, so Alderman Ray Lopez moves to pass on the item. Any objections to that motion?

[Speaker 47] (4:35:15 - 4:35:17)
Yeah, Ray Lopez from the 30th Ward.

[Speaker 1] (4:35:19 - 4:36:23)
Y'all look alike. It's been a long meeting so far, so I'm sorry I'm not as sharp as I should be. All right, so is Roboyas gonna do it?

Yes. All right, Roboyas moves to pass. Any objections, Raymond, or no?

I object. Hearing none, the item is passed as substituted and amended to a type one. All right, next we're gonna move to the bottom of page 11, item number 20441 in the 41st Ward.

The ordinance was referred on July 22nd of 2020. This common address, 5656 North Newcastle Avenue, and the change request, institutional plan development number 276 to an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district, then to institutional plan development number 276 as amended. Why do you have these?

[Speaker 3] (4:36:25 - 4:36:27)
Why do I have these crazy cases?

[Speaker 1] (4:36:28 - 4:36:38)
I love the fact we're helping the Danish community, which I'm partial to, but we've got so much narrative, and I know you're gonna explain it to us. So let's start, Sarah.

[Speaker 3] (4:36:38 - 4:36:40)
You want the full narrative or the quick?

[Speaker 1] (4:36:40 - 4:36:42)
Oh, I want abbreviated.

[Speaker 3] (4:36:42 - 4:37:45)
All right, I'll do my very best. This also has been a long time coming. I've been working on this, believe it or not, for over four years.

So with that, I am very happy to be here this afternoon on behalf of the applicant, the Society for the Danish Old People's Home, which is commonly known as the Danish Home, who is seeking to amend the existing plan development that governs the operation of its senior assisted living facility at the subject site. Similarly to my previous case, as a matter of procedural background, we appeared before the Chicago Plan Commission to present this proposal pursuant to the recommendations of the Department of Planning and Development at its public hearing on November 19th of this year as such, I would respectfully request at this time that the record of proceedings and all documents and exhibits submitted thereto from the hearing, please be adapted into the record here today.

[Speaker 1] (4:37:47 - 4:38:16)
Alderman Raymond Lopez moves to incorporate the plans from the Plan Commission. Do we need it to be amended? No, okay.

So just moved to incorporate the plans and the recommendations from the Plan Commission. Thank you. Is anyone opposed to that motion by Alderman Lopez to do?

Hearing none, the item is... The records are incorporated and continue on.

[Speaker 3] (4:38:16 - 4:38:30)
Thank you. And we had submitted a PowerPoint presentation to staff prior to the hearing, Alderman or Chairman, I'm not sure if that's available. If you want to look at any pretty pictures.

[Speaker 40] (4:38:33 - 4:38:35)
Here's an interesting site.

[Speaker 1] (4:38:35 - 4:38:36)
We don't have it loaded.

[Speaker 3] (4:38:36 - 4:38:37)
Oh, we don't have it.

[Speaker 1] (4:38:37 - 4:38:37)
We don't have it loaded.

[Speaker 3] (4:38:37 - 4:38:39)
Okay, you get to continue.

[Speaker 1] (4:38:39 - 4:38:49)
I'll use a point of personal privilege though. I was on the Plan Commission when this is, it is a very, very impressive, what is it, a hundred year old building?

[Speaker 3] (4:38:49 - 4:38:51)
Yeah, it's very old building.

[Speaker 1] (4:38:52 - 4:38:52)
It's beautiful.

[Speaker 3] (4:38:53 - 4:43:32)
And I guess the reason I bring it up is in addition to this very old, beautiful building, the original construction, which dates back to 1907, when the nuns, the Danish nuns first founded this organization, above and beyond that, over 50% of the site is actually fully landscaped, open space and gardens that are not only available to the residents of the retirement community, but also to residents of the neighborhood surrounding there.

So it is a quite impressive site. Sorry that you don't get to see it. You'll just have to be stuck with me.

So towards that end, as I alluded to, the Danish home established this retirement community, which consists of all assisted living rooms in 1907. It has gone through a couple of revisions and a modification since 1907, but for the most part, especially operationally, it has remained the same for over a hundred years. So right now, the Danish home is reevaluating things and in an effort to improve and enhance the quality of life for its existing residents, it is proposing to undertake construction of two new lateral additions to the building, one on each side of the building.

So if you can imagine on a typical building, there's gonna be two new wings on each side. The existing facility is three stories. The two proposed new wings will also be three stories in stature, so to remain consistent.

Despite the additions, there will still be over 40% of the site that will be completely permeable, landscaped green space, including again, all of those gardens, as well as part of the proposal, the Danish home is going to undertake the repaving of certain of the public ways around the bordering the sites to be permeable because that area of the city, as I'm sure many of you are aware in your own wards, is quite conducive to flooding. So they've taken, they've gone up, there it is.

They've gone above and beyond to incorporate some additional measures to not only avoid flooding on this site, but for the benefit of the entire neighborhood. And also despite the physical expansion of the building, the operations are not intended to change at all. Again, these are enhancements to the quality of life for the existing residents of the facility.

Some of the expansion will allow for instance, for a new dining room and other larger community gathering spaces, as well as to provide for a few more larger single occupancy units for the residents. Towards this end, the occupancy, the total occupancy both at the staff level and the residential level of the facility is going to remain the same as it has been for over a hundred years. So the same as it was with the original plan development.

So they are not seeking to increase occupancy or overall operations. As I indicated, we have been working on this project for quite some time now. We started with Alderman Napolitano and then progressed through the 41st Ward Zoning Advisory Committee.

During the last two years, we've had ongoing engagement with the residents of the neighborhood, especially in particular, the ones that border the subject property. And we have actually hosted in excess of four public open houses towards the programming for this proposal. After all of those efforts and several modifications, we are happy to have the support of the 47th, sorry, 41st Ward Zoning Advisory Committee, as well as Alderman Napolitano, who tendered again, a letter of support, memorializing his thoughts to the committee prior to this hearing.

So with all of that, I will rest and open it up for any questions.

[Speaker 1] (4:43:33 - 4:43:45)
All right, thank you. Sarah, do we have questions from committee members? For the benefit of the committee members, did the illustrations go to our committee members?

You see the, you saw the building, right? On your screen?

[Speaker 58] (4:43:46 - 4:43:47)
I did.

[Speaker 1] (4:43:49 - 4:44:38)
Okay. We tried it. We went back to the planning commission and pulled up some of the documents from the planning commission PowerPoint.

So anyways, gorgeous, gorgeous project, I think. Questions for the applicant, or we do have a letter of support from Alderman Napolitano. Move to pass as amended.

Yeah, all right. So I'm asking for the motion to move to pass as amended by the same roll call that was there to determine quorum. I heard Alderman Lopez to that effect.

Any objections to that motion? Hearing none, the item is passed as revised. Thank you.

[Speaker 4] (4:44:38 - 4:45:09)
Point of personal privilege. Yes, and who is this? Alderman Hopkins.

Oh, Alderman Bryan. I just want to apologize for my absence on council's previous matter that she called. I was on audio only and it was bad.

I lost cell service briefly. So I know the matter has been dispensed with, but I just wanted to go on the record with my support and also acknowledge Ms. Barnes outstanding work on this. This was a win for the community.

A lot of hard work went into this. And then I just wanted to express my appreciation. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (4:45:10 - 4:45:11)
Thank you, Bryan.

[Speaker 4] (4:45:11 - 4:45:12)
Duly noted.

[Speaker 1] (4:45:13 - 4:45:45)
All right. All right, now moving to page 12, top of page 12, item number 20444-T1, 27th Ward. Ordinance was referred on July 22nd of 2020.

Common address, 1423 through 1427 North Sedgwick Street. Change request, a B3-3 Community Shopping District to a B2-5 Neighborhood Mixed Use District. Sarah.

[Speaker 3] (4:45:46 - 4:48:47)
Thank you so much for one last time today, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Sarah Barnes and I'm an attorney with the Law Offices of Sam Banks. Happy to be here this afternoon on behalf of the applicant and property owner who is seeking a zoning map amendment that will allow for the rehabilitation of the existing improvements at the subject site, as well as the redevelopment of the vacant portion of that same property.

Toward that end, the subject property, which is located on a predominantly residential block of Sedgwick Avenue in the Old Town neighborhood, consists of three contiguous parcels. One of those parcels, generally described as 1427 North Sedgwick Street, is presently improved with a five-story mixed use building, which contains a commercial unit at grade level and five dwelling units above. Despite the applicant's best efforts and as further frustrated by the recent COVID pandemic, the commercial unit has remained vacant without any interest for a couple of years now.

The other two parcels, generally described as 1423 through 1425 North Sedgwick, are presently vacant and unimproved. The applicant is seeking the previously described zoning map amendment in order to permit the construction of a new six-story multi-unit residential building on the two vacant parcels and to permit the conversion of the grade level commercial unit within the existing five-story building into a residential unit. The proposed new six-story building will feature a total of 23 dwelling units on and between the first through sixth floors, five of which such units will be offered as affordable in cooperation with the Department of Housing and all of the strong efforts of the Affordable Requirements Ordinance as championed by Alderman Burnett.

Aside from the interior build-out of the basement and first floor of the existing five-story building to accommodate for the additional dwelling unit, no other physical alterations or additions are proposed for that building. The applicant has spent over a year working with the esteemed members of the Old Town Merchants and Residents Association toward the programming for this proposal. Over time and in consideration of certain modifications made to the proposal during the ongoing review, the association recently issued its written support for this application.

As well, that letter of support was tendered to the committee as well as to Alderman Burnett. I believe Alderman Burnett still are present in the hearing and may wish to offer his own thoughts on the project.

[Speaker 20] (4:48:48 - 4:48:54)
Yeah, I apologize for the burst out. Mr. Chairman, is it okay for me to speak?

[Speaker 1] (4:48:54 - 4:48:56)
Yes, it is.

[Speaker 20] (4:48:57 - 4:49:16)
All right, I don't want Sarah running your meetings. But anyway, Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. As the councilor said, she's been working on this for over a year with the Old Town Merchants and Residents Association.

The community is in support of this, so I ask for the committee's support, thank you.

[Speaker 1] (4:49:20 - 4:49:33)
All right, any questions for the alderman or the attorney? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 4] (4:49:35 - 4:49:36)
Moved by Alderman Hopkins.

[Speaker 1] (4:49:36 - 4:49:45)
Alderman Hopkins makes that motion. Any objections to the motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Thank you, Sarah.

[Speaker 3] (4:49:46 - 4:49:48)
Thank you, everyone, have a great day.

[Speaker 1] (4:49:49 - 4:50:27)
All right, now we're on middle of page 12, document number 20438 in the 11th ward. The ordinance was referred on July 22nd of 2020, and the common address is 2424 South Halstead Street. The change request, planned manufacturing district 11 and Waterway Heliport planned development number 1236, Waterway Industrial Plan Development.

We have either Rich Clowder or Liz Butler or both to make the presentation.

[Speaker 13] (4:50:27 - 4:51:34)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, it'll be me. I hope you can all hear me. Good afternoon, members of the committee.

As the alderman indicated, my name is Rich Clowder. I'm with the law firm of DLA Piper. My colleague, Liz Butler, and I represent the applicant in this matter, 2420 South Halstead LLC, which is an affiliate of Prologis, a global leader in industrial real estate development.

The applicant seeks in this matter to rezone the property from its current designation of PMD District 11 and Waterway Heliport Plan Development number 1236 to a combined industrial waterway plan development to facilitate the development of the subject property with a best-in-class industrial distribution center containing approximately 112,104 square feet of floor area. I should mention preliminarily that the proposed plan development was considered and recommended for approval by the Chicago Plan Commission on November 19th, 2020. And we request that you first entertain a motion to the effect that the transcript of those proceedings and resolution from the plan commission be incorporated into the record here today.

[Speaker 1] (4:51:39 - 4:52:01)
All right. All right. So first of all, we need to incorporate the records from the plan commission.

Can I get a motion by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? So moved. So moved by Alderman Roboyas.

Any objections to the motion? Hearing none, the records are incorporated. Continue, Rich.

[Speaker 13] (4:52:01 - 4:56:29)
Thank you. As you'll see from the images that appear on the screen, the subject property is located along the south branch of the Chicago River within PMD 11 and the Pilsen Industrial Corridor as well. Perlogis proposes to redevelop the subject property with, as I said, a best-in-class industrial distribution center containing 112,104 square feet of floor area, the primary use of which will be for a last mile logistics and distribution facility, which is a permitted use as of right in the PMD.

Due only to the property's proximity to the Chicago River, the developer is required to seek approval of a waterway plan development. I want to mention that no change to the underlying zoning in this case is required or requested. With respect to the treatment of the river walk and site landscaping, I want to just quickly note the following.

Extensive attention will be given to greening the site. The project will provide a 30-foot wide river setback with an access point at Halstead and a 10-foot wide fully ADA compliant route on the west side of the site from Hillock to the proposed river walk, providing for a welcoming river walk access for residents of the neighborhood to the south and west, as well as for project employees. In addition to extensive greening, sustainability is built into the project design and operations.

The proposed building will be designed to be a LEED certified building. The building will be 100% solar ready. Parking for fleet vehicles will be 100% EV ready.

The project will recycle or reuse more than 80% of the construction and demolition debris produced on site as part of the project's construction and demolition activities. I also want to mention that significant attention has been given to vehicular access and neighborhood impact. We have provided 137 standard vehicular parking spaces for employees.

We are also providing 300 plus branded fleet delivery vehicles and parking associated therewith. In keeping with the environmentally friendly theme of the project, 100% of the parking for fleet vehicles will provide electric vehicle ready infrastructure to facilitate a transition to zero emission delivery vehicles. Very close attention is also paid to managing vehicular access in a manner that will limit the impact on the neighborhood.

For example, the project will allow truck access from Halstead Street exclusively to the east. The developer will design, fund and install a new traffic signal at the Halstead driveway and will design and implement pavement markings that are protective of pedestrian and bicycle safety at the Halstead Street entrance. Employees will be allowed to access the site from Halstead or from Archer only via driveways located at Corbett and Seenor streets.

These access management requirements will address the current traffic management issue of large trucks and commercial vehicles navigating residential streets to the west of the site. Let me conclude by saying that the proposed development will redevelop and remediate a substantially underutilized and blighted brownfield site with a solar ready, electric vehicle ready, lead silver building containing an active job creating use that will strengthen the city's supply chain infrastructure as well as provide a river walk that will serve as a publicly accessible recreational amenity for the community and for employees. Largely as a result of input from the alderman, neighborhood residents and stakeholder organizations, as well as importantly from DPD and CDOT, the site plan that was developed is sensitive to the river and adjacent land uses and is protective of the public health and the environment and a considerably greener and superior development proposal is the result. Last but not least, the project will create up to 150 construction jobs and a minimum of 200 permanent warehouse jobs, the vast majority of which will be full-time jobs paying at least $15 an hour and providing generous benefits to employees.

In light of the foregoing, we respectfully request that you recommend city council approval of this application. We appreciate your time and consideration. Our team is available to answer any questions you may have.

And I believe you have on file a copy of a letter of support transmitted by Alderman Thompson. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (4:56:29 - 4:56:34)
Rich, we do have a letter from Alderman Thompson. I believe he might be on the call if he wants to say a few words.

[Speaker 16] (4:56:36 - 4:58:48)
Thank you, chairman, I am. And I appreciate it to Rich Clutter and the development team prologist for all of their work and working with the city departments in the community and being responsive to our concerns. I also wanna especially thank our team at the city from DPD to CDOT to all of those involved.

They did an excellent job. Most especially I'd like to thank my community for their engagement and involvement in this process. We had a community meeting.

It was back in June. It was our largest Zoom meeting under these difficult times to have a participation. And then subsequent correspondence, we had another community meeting, a quarterly community meeting town hall meeting where we again had more discussion on this.

Not everyone agrees on all of the parts of a development, but I do wanna thank the development team for being responsive to those concerns. I think this solves a big problem for our community that has truck traffic currently going through their residential portion of the neighborhood. And I think this development, the way it's gonna be designed and the way it's gonna be built will compliment the community there.

It's a great example of how two different types of uses can coexist. And this will be the fourth distribution facility in my ward within the last year and a half. As we continue to see that grow to our West, there's a large FedEx facility to the North down Halston Street.

We've got UPS. And as we all know, as the e-commerce continues to grow, we'll see this. So this is a great example of how we can work together.

I appreciate the work on the riverfront to provide benefits to the community and also other benefits that the developer is gonna be providing, helping our viaducts, which are in desperate need for beautification and improvement. So I fully support this project and I appreciate the committee's support for this project as well. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (4:58:49 - 4:58:58)
Alderman, questions for the Alderman or the team? I see Alderman Beal's hand up. Alderman Beal.

[Speaker 56] (4:59:00 - 4:59:33)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to congratulate Alderman Thompson on a wonderful project. When you look at exactly where the economy is going with logistics and deliveries and things like that, this is a great addition to what, you know, industries are trying to accomplish here in the city of Chicago.

And so this is a great project. It's gonna bring some more badly needed jobs to the Southside and I just wanted to congratulate the Alderman along with his community on a job well done. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (4:59:35 - 4:59:38)
Thank you, Alderman Beal. Alderman Walter Burnett.

[Speaker 20] (4:59:38 - 5:00:59)
Hold on one moment. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. I had the pleasure of seeing this proposal at the plan commission.

It brought up some interesting questions about doing things in communities on the river and things such as that. You know, I have areas like this in my ward. Unfortunately, you know, a lot of communities, these areas are getting so expensive.

We're losing a lot of manufacturers. It's important that we continue to keep jobs in these neighborhoods. This is a big win for that community.

I commend the Alderman on working with his neighborhood, getting guaranteed jobs for people in the community. I think this is fantastic. I also commend the organization for acknowledging some of the community's concerns or some of the activists' concerns as far as trying to get electric vehicles to address some of those concerns.

I think this is a win-win for the city. I look forward for more of these to be coming in the city. I'm hoping that another one come to my ward because my folks are looking for more jobs.

So congratulations to you all.

[Speaker 1] (5:01:00 - 5:01:30)
Thank you, Alderman. I don't see any other hands up. Can I get a motion by committee member, move do pass by the roll call that was used to determine- Move do pass, Alderman Cardona.

I'm gonna give Alderman Cardona, I'm giving Alderman Cardona the motion moved by him. Any objections to that motion? All rise.

All right, hearing no major objections, the item is passed as revised.

[Speaker 13] (5:01:30 - 5:01:30)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (5:01:31 - 5:03:08)
And I just wanted to congratulate the team. I was on the planning commission and I think I wanted to reiterate, I think the department of planning is working on a plan for the South Loop or the South portion of the Chicago River. And I know we as a city know that logistics and distribution has always been the strength of the city, but it's 2020, we need to up the plans as we move forward with Chicago, again, being the center of the transportation network in the city.

So as Alderman Thompson said, there's a lot of work here. And if he's talking about four distribution centers in his ward, we definitely need more master plans in regards to how we're going to accommodate these industries and the traffic associated with it and protecting the neighbors and the residential quality that may or may not abut it. So I know there's a lot more work to be done and I appreciate the work that you all put in this application.

Thank you very much. All right, next, bottom of page 12, document number 20404, second ward. The ordinance was referred on May 20th of 2020.

Common address, 1623 through 1631 North Halsted Street. Change request, B3-2 Community Shopping District to a B3-5 Community Shopping District, then to a residential business plan development. I think we have Katie Jenke and Paul Shadle.

Katie, there you are, okay.

[Speaker 38] (5:03:08 - 5:03:33)
Thank you, good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Katie Jenke Dale with the law firm of DLA Piper and along with my colleague, Paul Shadle, we represent the applicant, LV Halsted LLC in this matter. As a preliminary matter, this application was considered and recommended for approval at the October 15th, 2020 plan commission hearing and we would request that a transcript from that hearing be incorporated into the record today.

[Speaker 1] (5:03:35 - 5:03:52)
I have Alderman Raymond Lopez moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to the motion? Hearing none, the records are now incorporated.

Katie, will you continue?

[Speaker 38] (5:03:53 - 5:04:45)
Great, thank you. The parcel is approximately 14,300 square feet located on the east side of Halsted just north of the brown line tracks as you can see on the screen. It's currently zoned B3-2 and the applicant is requesting a rezoning to the B3-5 prior to establishing a residential business plan development to allow the construction of a seven story building containing up to 79 units.

In ground floor commercial. We've held a neighborhood meeting in June of 2019 and a community meeting in March of 2020 and have made changes to the project as a result of those community engagement as well as input from DPD. We've worked closely with Alderman Hopkins on this project and you should have a letter of support in the file from the Alderman.

We're available for any questions you may have but respectfully request a positive recommendation on this matter, thank you.

[Speaker 1] (5:04:45 - 5:04:53)
You do have the letter of support. All right, Katie, we do have a letter of support from Alderman Hopkins, I believe.

[Speaker 17] (5:04:54 - 5:04:54)
We do.

[Speaker 1] (5:04:56 - 5:04:57)
Brian, are you on the call?

[Speaker 4] (5:04:59 - 5:05:00)
Yes, I am, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (5:05:01 - 5:05:04)
Would you like to comment on the Halsted project, sir?

[Speaker 4] (5:05:05 - 5:07:23)
I would, let me, all right, can you, I was gonna use an external mic but is my audio okay, can you hear me? Yeah. Yeah, I'm in full support of this project and I wanna give a shout out to the Lincoln Central Association for their partnership and their leadership and their advocacy on behalf of the community.

This is not the first project I've worked with them on but they're consistent in their approach. They're absolutely fierce advocates for their neighborhood. Every project that they get involved in, they make it better at the end of the process and this is no exception.

They're tough, but they're fair, which is why they're in support of this project at the end of this process, as am I as the alderman for this community. This will bring some much needed rental housing to this area. It was considered at one point for a hotel type of use that has been rejected.

And if there's ever a change of heart, we'll start the process all over again and go back to the very beginning with Lincoln Central and with the neighbors. So that is not a concern at this point. This is for residents who will be living in this property.

My office has made it clear we're not going to be giving exception letters. This is a TOD property. We do not expect that the residents who live there will all own private automobiles.

It's next to the L, as you can see from the photographs there. And there's a subway station nearby. So we're very proud of the end result of this.

It was a lengthy process with numerous community meetings, but I think the end use here is a win-win for all. And I'd also like to thank the Department of Planning for some of the aesthetical improvements that they advocated for. Taste is in the eye of the beholder, of course, but I happen to think this is an attractive building and it really blends in with the area and it enhances the character of this very important corridor right across the street from Steppenwolf in a very thriving theater district as well, Royal George right there as well.

So I would urge my colleagues to support this project and let's get in the ground with this one, guys. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (5:07:24 - 5:07:37)
Questions for the Alderman or the attorney? Let me see. I'm sorry, Brian, just a quick question.

I know it's TOD, but how many parking spaces? Did I hear little or none?

[Speaker 4] (5:07:39 - 5:07:41)
Well, lots of bike parking spaces.

[Speaker 26] (5:07:41 - 5:07:41)
All right.

[Speaker 4] (5:07:41 - 5:07:55)
That's good, I think each unit has its own and there is a commercial element of it. You can see, you know, cars parked alongside of it. Yeah, okay.

As far as the residential parking, what was the final number, Katie? I don't think we did it.

[Speaker 38] (5:07:56 - 5:08:09)
There's no residential parking, but we do have, to your point, we're within 400 feet of the North and Clybourne Station and have, you know, right on the Halstead and North Avenue bus lines. All right.

[Speaker 1] (5:08:09 - 5:08:43)
So you're right across from Steppenwolf, right? And then they were building a parking garage, correct? It seemed to be, you know, stalled forever and ever.

So maybe they can park when there's no theater. If the theater comes back, but it just, I know how congested that intersection is and Halstead is not easy to navigate as the Alderman knows. So yeah, that was just my question.

I think it's a handsome building and I applaud the team and the Alderman on this one.

[Speaker 4] (5:08:43 - 5:10:01)
And Alderman, Chairman, since you mentioned the parking structure and the lengthy delays that that project has experienced, it's on the other side of a war border. Halstead is a dividing line here between my ward and the 43rd ward. But it's interesting that that parking structure itself and the construction project, the delays behind it have really become an exhibit for transit advocates in Chicago because when that parking garage was first advocated and planned for, the parking environment that we live in was dramatically different.

And thanks to all sorts of delays and all sorts of unforeseen things that happened by the time they were ready to try to finish the project, the demand for parking had significantly been reduced. And that's sort of a visual symbol of the direction we're going here. And it's often cited as a reason why we have to be very careful on insisting on large parking structures as if they're always going to be needed and they're always going to be present.

That isn't always the case. The wheel is very much in spin here and we're moving in a new direction. So thank you for giving me the opportunity to point that out.

And again, I think we're really ready to move on this. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (5:10:01 - 5:10:31)
Okay, any other questions for committee member, the Alderman? Hearing none, can I get a motion? Move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

So moved. So moved. Alderman Walter Burnett moves do pass.

Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed. Now we are going to the top of page 13.

Staying in the second ward.

[Speaker 22] (5:10:33 - 5:10:34)
Wait, what are we doing?

[Speaker 1] (5:10:38 - 5:11:15)
20517, the second ward. The ordinance was referred on October 7th, 2020. The common address is 46 through 74, West Oak Street, 1000 through 1006 North Dearborn and 1001 through 1007 North Clark Street.

Change request. C25 motor vehicle related district to a DX10 downtown mixed use district and then to a residential business plan development. Katie, are you on?

Yes, you are on this one. Okay.

[Speaker 48] (5:11:16 - 5:11:18)
Actually it's Paul on this one.

[Speaker 1] (5:11:19 - 5:11:20)
Okay, Paul Shadle.

[Speaker 48] (5:11:22 - 5:11:43)
Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon, Paul Shadle with the law firm of DLA Piper with my colleague, Katie Janky Dale representing the applicant in this matter, 40 West Oak owner LLC. The application was considered and recommended for approval during the November 19th, 2020 plan commission hearing and so I would request that the transcript from that hearing be incorporated into the record.

[Speaker 1] (5:11:46 - 5:11:59)
Alderman Ariel Rabois moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the records are incorporated.

[Speaker 48] (5:12:00 - 5:13:57)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The site has an area of approximately 29,600 square feet located at the Northwest corner of Clark and Dearborn streets. As you noted, we're requesting a zoning to a residential business plan development that would be comprised of two sub areas, sub area A on the West containing the existing Warren Bar medical rehabilitation center and sub area B that would contain the new residential building that's before you today.

This building would have 35 stories and contain approximate or a maximum of 70 condo units and 160 parking spaces, 50 of which parking spaces will serve the existing bar pavilion in the other sub area A. I wanna thank Alderman Hopkins and the department of planning and development for facilitating a design review process over the last 18 months. We held community meetings in October of 2019 and in February of 2020.

And as a result of those meetings and the city agency input made changes to the building that included a reduction in height from approximately 503 feet to the 466 feet that you see on the slide up now and a reduction in units from 90 units to 75, along with some other enhanced landscaping and improved vehicular access to completely eliminate a curb cut on Dearborn street. In addition to the building, public benefits would include a payment for an FAR bonus of approximately $1.38 million and compliance with the affordable requirements ordinance through a payment in lieu for eight units of approximately $1.9 million. We expect the project to generate about 450 construction jobs, 10 to 12 permanent jobs.

We're here to answer any questions that you may have, but I will then respectfully request the committee's positive recommendation.

[Speaker 1] (5:13:58 - 5:14:01)
Thank you, Paul. Alderman Hopkins.

[Speaker 4] (5:14:04 - 5:15:54)
Oh yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman. You have a letter of support from my office on this project as well. This was subject to a community review process, took a little bit over a year.

There was opposition at the start of the process, less so at the end of the process, but I should state for the record, we did not successfully resolve all the outstanding issues from the immediate neighbors. There's another residential building you can see in the rendering on the screen, literally across the street. And some of the residents there raised some valid objections.

We did our best to address them, but at the end, I think they're just uncomfortable with the close proximity of this building. Nevertheless, the revisions that did result were significant. You heard the unit count was reduced, the height is reduced, and the FAR on that sub parcel was also reduced.

There was also some very significant design revisions that were made in conjunction with staff from the Department of Planning and the Department of Transportation to greatly enhance the pedestrian experience and also traffic safety. We reconfigured the port to share and the way traffic will flow in and out of the building. This will also resolve some of the street blockage issues caused by the current use at the Warren Bar Pavilion, moving more of that off street, we think will be of a net benefit to the community.

So I'm very happy to be able to support this project. As I stated during my remarks at plan commission, I happen to think this is an attractive design. It's from the office of Lucien Lagrange, one of his top architects that works on his team did this work, I'm sure with his oversight as well.

It's a beautiful addition to the neighborhood. And I think it's going to be a very popular destination for new homeowners in the city of Chicago.

[Speaker 1] (5:15:54 - 5:15:55)
And I think- That's enough.

[Speaker 4] (5:15:55 - 5:15:56)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (5:15:57 - 5:16:06)
All right. Brian, questions for the applicants or the aldermen on this project?

[Speaker 47] (5:16:09 - 5:16:11)
So move on this beautiful projects.

[Speaker 1] (5:16:11 - 5:16:27)
Yeah. Hey, Brian, I just have one question. Obviously the Warren Bar is staying.

What is on this site currently? Yeah, it's owned by Warren. Is that the parking?

Was that the parking for Warren Bar?

[Speaker 4] (5:16:27 - 5:17:04)
It is. And we're addressing their parking needs by doing this as well, as I mentioned. So this was something that they had asked for going back several years, as a matter of fact.

Right, okay. It wasn't until they partnered with Lucien Lagrange that a proposal I thought the community could live with was brought forth. But as I said, the traffic and the drop-off and pickup issues for Warren Bar have been a problem in this area for a long time.

And we think this project, if not solving it, will certainly mitigate it. Thanks, Brian. All right, any other questions?

[Speaker 1] (5:17:06 - 5:17:23)
If not, can I get a motion to move do pass on this same roll call that was used to determine quorum? So move. And as my vice chair, Alderman Roboyes moves do pass.

Any objections? Hearing none, the item is pass as revised.

[Speaker 48] (5:17:23 - 5:17:26)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, appreciate it.

[Speaker 1] (5:17:26 - 5:17:58)
All righty, now we're middle of page 13. Document number 20483, 27th Ward. Ordinance was referred on September 9th of 2020.

This comment address is 1020 North Elston Avenue. Change request. PMD number two, planned manufacturing district to business plan development.

Katie Jenke-Dale. Katie.

[Speaker 38] (5:17:59 - 5:18:22)
Thank you, good afternoon. Again, for the record, my name is Katie Jenke-Dale from the law firm of DLA Piper. And I represent the applicant SkyFault Owner LLC for this matter.

As a preliminary matter, this application was reviewed and recommended for approval by the plan commission on October 15th, 2020. We would request that a transcript of that hearing be incorporated into the record today.

[Speaker 1] (5:18:25 - 5:18:39)
So Raymond Lopez moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to the motion? Hearing none, the records are now incorporated.

[Speaker 38] (5:18:40 - 5:19:34)
Thank you. This is an irregular shape parcel on the east side of Elston between Augusta and Cortez that the applicant acquired in 2018 and improved with a Lyft driver center. It's currently zoned PMD2 and the PD is being requested to allow for light equipment sales and rental as a permitted use in order to allow Lyft to lease vehicles at its existing facility.

No changes to the existing improvements are proposed, but the PMD2 district requires a plan development in order to authorize this use. This application has been reviewed by DPD, the neighbors of River West, the Racine Triangle Association, as well as North Branch Works, all of whom have issued letters of support. We're available for any questions that you or the committee may have, but respectfully request a favorable recommendation in this matter.

[Speaker 20] (5:19:34 - 5:19:35)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (5:19:36 - 5:19:43)
All right. This item being in the 27th ward, Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 20] (5:19:43 - 5:20:29)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. As the counselor said, she met with the community groups, one, which is the neighbors of River West, which is a group that I've been working with for my whole career. Folks been in neighborhood for a long time.

The new organization is the Racine Neighbors. They got all of their support. Actually, what the developer did with this property was cleaned it up.

It used to be old cab stand and a lot of cabs used to go there and get their cars fixed. Now it's a facility that Lyft uses and they've done a fantastic job is enhancing the community, enhancing the property values in the area. Everyone's in support of it and I ask for your support also.

[Speaker 9] (5:20:30 - 5:20:30)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (5:20:31 - 5:20:35)
Thank you, Alderman. Questions for the applicant and or the Alderman?

[Speaker 9] (5:20:38 - 5:20:39)
No questions.

[Speaker 1] (5:20:40 - 5:20:43)
Hearing none, can I get a motion by...

[Speaker 9] (5:20:43 - 5:20:44)
Alderman David Moore.

[Speaker 1] (5:20:44 - 5:21:03)
Alderman David Moore to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to David Moore's, Alderman Moore's request? Hearing none, the item is passed.

And not just the way it is.

[Speaker 38] (5:21:03 - 5:21:03)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (5:21:03 - 5:21:54)
Pass is revised. All right, thanks, Katie. And now we're on the bottom of page 13.

Document number 20429, 46th Ward. Ordinance was referred on June 17th of 2020. Common address 4400 through 4424 and also 4401 to 4415 North Clarendon Avenue.

The change request, business residential plan development number 138 to residential business plan development number 138 as amended. We have Mariah Degrino, I believe. Okay.

Thank you.

[Speaker 33] (5:21:54 - 5:22:31)
Good afternoon, Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Mariah Degrino with the law firm of DLA Piper at 444 West Lake Street in Chicago. I, along with my colleague, Paul Shadle, represent Montrose and Clarendon LLC, the applicant for the zoning map amendment for the property generally located at 4400 North Clarendon and 4401 North Clarendon.

The application is a technical amendment to residential business plan development number 138. The matter was heard by the plan commission and recommended for approval on October 15th. I would like to ask that the record of the plan commission's proceedings be incorporated into the record here.

[Speaker 1] (5:22:33 - 5:22:46)
Alderman Raboyas moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. So moved. Any objections to the motion?

Hearing none, the records are incorporated. Continue.

[Speaker 33] (5:22:47 - 5:23:46)
Thank you. The plan development was previously the site of the former Cuneo Hospital and then the Maryville Academy Children's Shelter operated by the Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart. The shelter closed in 2005 and the building sat vacant until the applicant worked to establish this PD in 2016.

The PD contemplates a phased development of three sub areas which are shown on the screen as sub areas A, B, and C. The applicant has completed construction of the first two sub areas, sub area A and sub area C. Sub area A has been developed with a 27 story mixed use building, including 381 dwelling units and approximately 30,000 square feet of commercial space at the ground floor.

Sub area C has been developed with a single story commercial building consisting of approximately 6,200 square feet of commercial space. And it will be occupied by two commercial tenants, a phone store and event clinic. Sub area B is a future phase of development and is planned for a multi-family residential building containing up to 250 dwelling units.

[Speaker 18] (5:23:46 - 5:23:48)
That should be in subscription, right?

[Speaker 33] (5:23:49 - 5:25:14)
Sub area B is not affected by this application. The purpose of today's amendment is to allow additional commercial and non-residential uses of the ground floor commercial space within sub area A and within sub area C, consistent with the uses that are allowed in the underlying B3-5 district. The impetus for the application is the need to include animal services as a permitted use to allow the vet clinic to occupy the sub area C building and to improve the marketability of the ground floor space in the sub area A building.

Alderman Kappelman is in support of the application and has provided a letter of support to the committee. As Nicole was flipping through the slides, you may have noticed there was a slide photo of the sub area C building and the one previous to this, which is a photo of the landscaping. There were questions raised at the plan commission hearing including by Chairman Tenney about the condition of the landscaping along the east side of the building.

So I wanted to provide better representative photos of that. The plantings are relatively new, so do have some growing to do, but there are, as you can see kind of in the foreground, two crabapple trees, and then working backwards from there, two more crabapple trees, and then behind those towards the upper left side of the photo here, you'll see two maple trees along the landscaping as well. If there are any questions, I would be happy to answer those, but otherwise, thank you for consideration.

[Speaker 1] (5:25:14 - 5:25:17)
Thank you, Mariah. Alderman Kappelman.

[Speaker 17] (5:25:18 - 5:25:56)
Sure, thank you. The owner pulled permits to put it in the veterinary clinic and were granted the permits. And after they were granted permits, they realized there was a mistake between DPD's communication and the building's department about what was permitted to be there.

So because of this error, that's not the fault of the building owner, I thought it'd be the most ethical thing to do is to go ahead and grant them this change. So I ask support from my colleagues on this.

[Speaker 1] (5:25:57 - 5:26:54)
Thank you, Alderman. Questions for the Alderman and the applicant? And before I ask for a motion, I'm sorry, I was as equally concerned about the one-story building and the cladding of it.

It's such a handsome building on the residential side. I remember that the community really didn't want anything built on this site, but I hope with the new tenants that, and again, it's only a picture, but it's such a valuable corner right on the park. And I know the vet use will be appropriate, especially with the number of dog owners in our North side.

So that was more of a criticism on the one-story than it was the landscaping. All right, Raymond Lopez. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 37] (5:26:54 - 5:27:13)
Actually, my question was for Department of Zoning. I know Alderman Smith has an ordinance allowing for veterinary use. I think it's in this kind of zoning district.

Would that have saved Alderman Kappelman from changing the zoning if that was in place?

[Speaker 6] (5:27:16 - 5:27:39)
Alderman, this is Patrick Murphy. This particular use was very specifically excluded from this plan development, independent of anything that Alderman Smith is proposing. So we had to make this text change in order for them to move ahead from a licensing standpoint.

Got it, okay.

[Speaker 1] (5:27:39 - 5:27:46)
Thank you, Chairman. Thank you, Patrick. Other questions?

Can I get a motion?

[Speaker 22] (5:27:48 - 5:27:49)
Motion moved, Cardona.

[Speaker 1] (5:27:50 - 5:28:00)
Okay, so Alderman Cardona makes a motion to pass this item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that motion?

[Speaker 47] (5:28:01 - 5:28:01)
So moved.

[Speaker 1] (5:28:03 - 5:28:42)
Is it answered? Yes, sir. Okay, I'm hearing no objection.

Item is passed as revised. Thank you. All right, now we're moving into the first ward.

Document number 20535T1. First ward ordinance was referred on October 7th of 2020. This address is 2120 North Mozart Street.

Change request, RT4, residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district to a B23 neighborhood shopping district. Stephen Friedland. Hi, Stephen.

[Speaker 14] (5:28:42 - 5:31:13)
Yes, hello there. Can you hear me? We can, loud and clear.

Thank you. For the record, my name is Steve Friedland. I'm an attorney with Applegate and Thornton Thompson.

Here representing Lucha. Lucha is a not-for-profit developer of affordable housing. And this is a project where Lucha is partnering with the Humboldt Park United Methodist Church to develop 22 units of affordable housing at this location.

The site's currently improved with an existing building that contains 12 dwelling units and the church, the church which is occupied by Humboldt Park United Methodist Church. What Lucha and the church are requesting is a rezoning from RT4 to B2-3 to permit the conversion of the church sanctuary and the church portion of the building to residential use. And also to utilize the transit serve location benefits of the zoning ordinance to allow the parking to remain at zero.

There's currently no parking at the property. Lucha will convert the sanctuary portion of the building into 10 residential units. So that will get us the 22 units, 12 existing which will be rehabilitated and 22 new units.

There will be no significant changes to the exterior of the building. It's a really quite beautiful existing brick structure and it will just remain. This work will be done on the interior.

This is a type one rezoning and we submitted our narrative and plans. We have not made any changes to the narrative or plans since our filing. So there's no amendment that we're asking for just the approval of the existing, of the.

As I noted, there is no parking currently at this property. So part of the request and as a type one rezoning in the TSL is that parking would be reduced to zero in this location. I would note that there was a community meeting that we participated in that was sponsored by Alderman LaSpada that was on September 14th.

It was a very good meeting. We got, we think a very positive result from the community. I know the Alderman has submitted a letter in support to the committee, but I heard him earlier on the meeting, so he may be available.

All right.

[Speaker 1] (5:31:15 - 5:31:21)
So we have Alderman LaSpada, I believe on the call. Yes. Daniel, would you like to talk about this one on Mozart?

[Speaker 5] (5:31:22 - 5:32:27)
I certainly would chairman. I'm actually honored to. I have to say that Humboldt Park United Methodist and Lucha have been outstanding community development organizations in our ward.

Both the church and the CDC have been real forces for equity and justice in our community. And while there's a certain sadness to see HPUMC leaving this building, the purpose that we are putting it to through the work of Lucha through this zoning change really honors their legacy. Certainly we have a lot of work to continue to do to promote affordability within the first ward, but this is an excellent step in the right direction.

And I do need to thank Lucha for really being a collaborative responsive partner in our community zoning process, answering a lot of the concerns brought forward by neighbors in a really substantial way. But we have had really broad support for this project. So I'm very excited to see it move forward.

And I certainly hope my colleagues will give it a favorable consideration.

[Speaker 1] (5:32:30 - 5:32:36)
Thank you, Alderman. Questions for the Alderman or the applicants?

[Speaker 47] (5:32:36 - 5:32:41)
So moved, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (5:32:42 - 5:32:59)
Is that my vice chair again? Si. All right.

Hearing no questions by committee members, I'm entertaining the motion by Alderman Ravois to pass this item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that motion?

[Speaker 9] (5:33:01 - 5:33:01)
Nope.

[Speaker 1] (5:33:02 - 5:33:51)
The item is passed. All right. Thank you.

We're on the middle of page 14. Document number 20470, 25th Ward. Ordinance was referred on September 9th of 2020.

Oh, by the way, before that, I'm gonna go back to La Spada. For the record, we did get nine letters of community support on that item on Mozart. So forgot to mention that for the record.

But now we're back to the 20470, 25th Ward. The ordinance was referred on September 9th, 2020. This common address is 2008 through 2012, South Ashland Avenue.

And the change request is from a C12 Neighborhood Commercial District to a B23 Neighborhood Mixed Use District.

[Speaker 14] (5:33:52 - 5:36:00)
Steven Friedland. Yes, thanks again for the record. Steve Friedland with the law firm of Applegate and Thornton Thompson.

For this project, I'm here representing the Resurrection Project. Many of you know the Resurrection Project's a longstanding not-for-profit organization in Pilsen. It's developed many, many hundreds of units of affordable housing over the years.

And this is a project where TRP is requesting rezoning of this site from C1-2 to B2-3 to permit the redevelopment of an existing abandoned commercial parcel into 16 new units in a beautiful new residential building. All of these units will be affordable tax credit units. I do wanna note that when we filed the application originally, we were only proposing 14 units.

But during our community meeting process that was organized by Alderman Ciccio-Lopez, there really was a desire to see that grow. The site can accommodate it and the B2-3 can accommodate it. So the site now proposes 16 units.

The parcel is located on Ashland Avenue, which is a transit serve location. So it automatically qualifies for an as of right 50% parking reduction. This isn't a type one request.

This is simply a request to go to B2-3. And we will have six parking spaces, which is 50% of our required 12 parking spaces. It's really a beautiful building.

And all I can say is Ashland Avenue in this location has a lot of mixed uses. The existing site is an abandoned commercial property that TRP acquired about a year ago when it became available. And fortunately thought up this project and worked together with the Alderman on it.

I know the Alderman has provided a letter of support, but I know he was here earlier as well, if you would speak to this.

[Speaker 18] (5:36:02 - 5:36:03)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (5:36:04 - 5:36:32)
I wanna make sure Alderman Siccio-Lopez. Okay, we do have a letter of support from Alderman Siccio-Lopez. And for the record also, this has over 100, it looks like 110 letters of support from community members.

So it looks like it's a win-win, I hope. All right, so that being said, any questions from committee members? Raymond Lopez.

[Speaker 14] (5:36:33 - 5:37:09)
Thank you, Chairman. Who are the members of the LLC? The LLC is owned 100% by the Resurrection Project.

It's just a LLC that was created solely to own this parcel. So could they have done this without an LLC? They could have, but as you may know, most of the organizations certainly that we work with will create a separate LLC for each of the individual projects.

It's helpful with financing because lenders don't, lenders like to have separate entities that are their borrowers.

[Speaker 37] (5:37:11 - 5:37:18)
So 100%, this is the not-for-profit is the sole state owner of the LLC? That's correct.

[Speaker 1] (5:37:19 - 5:38:34)
Thank you, Chairman. Thank you, Alderman. Any other questions?

Hearing no questions, can I get a motion moved to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? So moved, Alderman Austin. Alderman Austin moves to pass.

Any objections to that motion? Hearing none, the item is passed. All right.

Now we are- Thank you very much. All right, top of page 15, document number 20485, 28th Ward, ordinance was referred on September 9th of 2020. The common address is 1257 through 1411 South Washtenaw Avenue, 1256 through 1368 South Tolman Avenue, 1355, 1365 South Tolman Avenue, and 2604 through 2664 West Ogden Avenue.

The change request, residential business plan development number 1430 to residential business plan development number 1430 as amended. We have Scott Bornstein.

[Speaker 52] (5:38:35 - 5:39:38)
Yes, Mr. Chairman. Scott Bornstein from the law offices, Neal and Leroy. Thank you, and thank you to the committee.

Here on behalf of Wintrust Financial Corporation, who is seeking to amend this plan development to really simply allow a drive-through ATM use within this much larger site. The specific ATM use was not permitted, so that required us to amend the whole PD, but that is all we are doing. We are only affecting one sub area of the site.

And again, we are only adding an ATM use, no other changes to the property, or no other use changes are proposed as a result of this. As a procedural matter, we did appear before the plan commission at its November hearing. And so I would request that all the records and findings and recommendations of the plan commission be incorporated into today's record.

[Speaker 1] (5:39:39 - 5:39:53)
All right, I'll come in. Kerry Austin moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, the records are incorporated.

[Speaker 52] (5:39:54 - 5:40:03)
Continue, Scott. Thank you. And so I think we've got plans here and I've got our project architect, Jeff Leitz.

[Speaker 2] (5:40:03 - 5:40:04)
How are you?

[Speaker 52] (5:40:07 - 5:40:35)
Great, so I have our project architect, Jeff Leitz is here. We have Laura Slivka from Wintrust Financial, and we also have Jeff Head from the Habitat Company, which is the overall developer of the site. We're happy to go through the plans if you'd like, but as I say, this really just includes the installation of an ATM off of 13th Place, but we're happy to run through those plans.

And then of course, take any questions.

[Speaker 1] (5:40:37 - 5:41:00)
Scott, knowing the fact that I think this is an existing approved plan development change of use for the bank, that being Wintrust, specifically for the drive-thru and the ATM, I don't think we need to go in through a long explanation unless any of my committee members would like to see a more detailed presentation. If not, I'm gonna ask you to continue.

[Speaker 52] (5:41:02 - 5:41:14)
That's great. That's all we have, then we would open it up to questions. Oh, well, one other thing, of course, we did get a recommendation and support letter from Alderman Irvin, and you should have a copy of that in your records.

[Speaker 1] (5:41:15 - 5:41:28)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Jason Irvin on file, thank you. Questions from committee members? Hearing none.

[Speaker 9] (5:41:29 - 5:41:31)
No questions, so moved by Alderman David Moore.

[Speaker 1] (5:41:32 - 5:41:40)
So Alderman David Moore makes a motion to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. All those, any objections to that motion?

[Speaker 58] (5:41:41 - 5:41:41)
No.

[Speaker 1] (5:41:42 - 5:41:47)
Hearing none, the item is passed as revised. Okay.

[Speaker 58] (5:41:47 - 5:41:48)
Thank you so much.

[Speaker 1] (5:41:48 - 5:42:06)
That gets us through the regular, okay. So I am going to ask, leave it to the body, I need a five minute break, okay? So let's recess for five minutes, and then we'll go back to the Aldermanics, okay.

[Speaker 20] (5:42:10 - 5:42:11)
So we're done with this.

[Speaker 1] (5:47:21 - 5:48:04)
Okay, take a deep breath. Here we go. We're going to go to page three.

This is Aldermanic number 8605 in the first ward. The ordinance was referred on September 9th of 2020. Common address is 2948 through 54 West Armitage, 2001 through 2011 North Humboldt Boulevard.

And the change request was a C13 neighborhood commercial district to C12 neighborhood commercial district. Alderman Daniel Espada.

[Speaker 5] (5:48:07 - 5:48:24)
So Alderman Tunney, chairman, I will say out of respect for the administration, they have asked me to not request a vote on this today, but I would like to, with your permission, discuss the matter with the committee and take their questions. Is that all right with you? I'm sorry.

[Speaker 1] (5:48:24 - 5:48:29)
So you're asking to not take a vote, but to hear the argument.

[Speaker 5] (5:48:30 - 5:48:35)
If I may, I know you guys have been going long. It will not take more than five minutes of your total time.

[Speaker 1] (5:48:36 - 5:48:47)
Okay, then we'll give you the five minutes. I'm going to put the clock on you, Daniel, okay? Because I know if the request is to defer, we're going to hear another five minutes at a subsequent meeting.

[Speaker 5] (5:48:48 - 5:51:16)
Hopefully we'll avoid it then. But I wanted to share with you, so this is related to a development at the corner of Humboldt Park and Armitage Avenue. Years before it took office, a restaurant was moving in there called Parsons.

Parsons was endeavoring to have a restaurant in this corner with a large outdoor seating capacity. The zoning as it was would not permit for this. It would have required so much substantial parking that it would have made the restaurant concept unfeasible.

The corporation at the time asked for zoning change up to C1-3 that would have permitted them to establish the restaurant and the outdoor seating and be excused from the parking requirement. At the time, the previous alderman and this council granted that zoning change with the understanding that has been communicated to me both verbally and through numerous emails, a long written record, that after the restaurant was established and had gotten going, that it would be down-zoned back to the original zoning from C1-2 to C1-3 and back down again. That did not happen for many years.

The group that had been working on this proposal, Logan Square Preservation, in communication with the owners of Parsons, communicated this request to us, which is why you see it brought forward. C1-3, I will add, is something of a spot zoning. Most of Armitage Avenue is C1-1, mostly dash one zoning.

The reason we are not bringing this to you today is one of the previous owners within the corporation, outside of all the evidence we've received, has voiced his objection, to which we are trying to work past that and come to an amicable resolution. But I wanted to put forward that what we are bringing before this committee, either now or at December 15th, is a rational and factual zoning change request grounded in the interest of the community, the written record that we have, and also a real rational reading of zoning and land use in the community. But I do wanna take this moment to see if there are any questions that I can answer from the committee.

[Speaker 1] (5:51:17 - 5:52:09)
No, you know what, Daniel, I don't think we're gonna take questions at this, because we appreciate you working with the administration and on the future debate, which we will have on this. So I thank you for bringing the perspective your office has received through emails, and obviously it was a different administration. But for the record, we do have a formal notice of concern about this.

And I appreciate you, as I said earlier, working with the administration and see how we can come up with a collective solution. So I'm going to, hold on a second, hold on a second. So Alderman LaSpada makes a motion to defer the previous red item.

All in favor? Aye. Aye, any opposed?

Opinion of the chair, the ayes have it, and this item will be deferred.

[Speaker 5] (5:52:10 - 5:52:11)
Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (5:52:14 - 5:53:17)
Okay, just for the record, I'm sorry. Alderman LaSpada is not a member of the committee. So I heard Alderman Ray Lopez.

So I'm gonna renew that. Alderman Ray Lopez makes a motion to defer the previous red item. All those in favor, aye.

Aye. Any opposed? Hearing no objections, the item has been deferred.

Okay. Sorry for that technicality. Now, page one of the revised agenda is item aldermanic 8606, 17th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on September 9th of 2020. The common address of this aldermanic is 1820 through 1830 West 69th Street. And the change request, an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to a B3-1 community shopping district.

Alderman David Moore.

[Speaker 9] (5:53:18 - 5:54:50)
David. Let me get, thank you so much. This is the item at 1820 to 1830 West 69th Street.

And the reason why we're coming back here, the person had the business there for way before I became alderman, past 13 or so years. And the matter, we had to down zone it because there was a lot of properties, just being businesses coming in that the community didn't want. Also, we have a lot of city land there that we can do development with that's contiguous along that stretch.

And so in trying to preserve that, we had that down zone, which he would have been grandfathered in, if you will, because we couldn't down zone an existing business. The problem is that he did not have, had not gotten his signage permit over those many years. And then it came up.

And when it came up, he got caught up in it. And so that's the purpose of doing this zoning change because the business was already there. He just never appropriately applied for signage for his business.

[Speaker 1] (5:54:51 - 5:55:05)
So, David, just another point of clarification, just for the record, was this address part of a larger down zoning designation?

[Speaker 9] (5:55:05 - 5:55:07)
Yes, from 1600.

[Speaker 1] (5:55:08 - 5:55:12)
May have been an error in regards to the existing business. Can you state that for the record?

[Speaker 9] (5:55:13 - 5:55:27)
Yes, and so it was an error as a part of a larger down zone that went from approximately 1700 West 69th Street all the way up to 200 West 69th Street.

[Speaker 1] (5:55:27 - 5:55:31)
All right. All right, sir. Do we have questions?

[Speaker 37] (5:55:34 - 5:55:36)
We do pass Chairman Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 1] (5:55:50 - 5:56:55)
Alderman Ray Lopez makes a motion to pass on this item by the same roll call that was used to determine roll call. Any opposed to the motion? Hearing none, this item is passed.

Thank you, David. Now we're staying with you though. Let me see.

Second item on page one. Item Aldermanic 8610, 17th Ward Ordinance was referred on September 9th of 2020. Common address of this item is 2437 through 51 West Lithuanian Plaza Court, 6900 through 6908 South Artesian Avenue, 6905 South Campbell Avenue.

And the change request is a B12 Neighborhood Shopping District and C11 Neighborhood Commercial District to a B22 Neighborhood Mixed Use District.

[Speaker 9] (5:56:56 - 5:57:44)
Alderman David Moore. Yes, thank you. And what's interesting about this, along that strip, there are several within that area identical properties with this B2-2 designation.

The situation here is that these properties have been vacant for so long and we have a developer that's coming in to want to rehab and bring them back online and do some great work in an area that is much needed. So, and you have residential units, we need some more affordable housing over there. So this would be very helpful if the committee gave the approval on this.

So thank you.

[Speaker 1] (5:57:46 - 5:59:37)
All right, questions for the Alderman? Move. No further questions.

Can I get a motion? Did I hear that? Move to pass.

Alderman Dowell makes the motion to move to pass on the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to the motion? So moved.

No objections? Hearing no orders, the ordinance is passed. All right, now we are going- Thank you all.

Thank you, David. Alderman Dowell. Now we're going to Alderman Dowell.

Her document number is A8609, Third Ward. Ordinance was referred on September 9th of 2020. The common address of this is 63 through 79, East 36th Place, 3632 through 3674, South Michigan Avenue, 3641 through 3675, South Michigan Avenue, 3650 through 3658, South Indiana Avenue, 3664 through 3674, South Indiana Avenue, 3631 through 3649, South Indiana Avenue, 3655 through 3657, South Indiana, and 64 through 210, East 37th Street.

The change request, an RT3.5 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district, B33 community shopping district, and C13 neighborhood commercial district, all to an RM5 residential multi-unit district. Alderman Pato.

[Speaker 18] (5:59:37 - 6:00:17)
Thank you, Chairman Toney. As you can see from what the chairman read, this is a hodgepodge of zoning classifications and what is basically a residential area in the Third Ward. This is the area just east of the police headquarters leading down Michigan, Indiana, 36th Street.

I'm asking for your favorable consideration to make the area consistent in its zoning for planning purposes.

[Speaker 1] (6:00:20 - 6:00:22)
Questions for the Alderman?

[Speaker 9] (6:00:23 - 6:00:26)
No questions, so moved by Alderman David Moore.

[Speaker 1] (6:00:26 - 6:00:37)
Hearing no questions by committee members, Alderman David Moore, moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that motion?

[Speaker 18] (6:00:39 - 6:00:39)
Nope.

[Speaker 1] (6:00:40 - 6:00:42)
Hearing none, the item is passed.

[Speaker 18] (6:00:42 - 6:00:45)
Thank you very much to the committee and thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (6:00:46 - 6:05:11)
Thank you. All right, now the following, I'm going to read them all, our aldermanic ordinances in the 35th Ward. I will read all of them and then we will take them all in one full swoop, I should say.

So that being said, I'm going to start with document on page one, document aldermanic 8493, 35th Ward. Ordinance was referred on July 24th of 19. Common address of this aldermanic is 2854 North Milwaukee Avenue.

The change requests a B2-2 neighborhood mixed use district to B2-1 neighborhood mixed use district. Second aldermanic application is A8494, 35th Ward. The ordinance was referred on July 24th of 19.

Common address 2875 North Milwaukee Avenue and the change request is B2-2 neighborhood mixed use district to B2-1 neighborhood mixed use district. Next item, number A is an aldermanic application 8495. Ward ordinance was referred on July 24th of 19.

This common address is 2832 to 2834 North Milwaukee Avenue. The change request on this one is a B2-2 neighborhood mixed use district to B2-1 neighborhood mixed use district. Next item, aldermanic number 8496, 35th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on July 24th of 19. Common address on this application is 2816 North Milwaukee Avenue and 3424 West Diversity Avenue. Change request, a B2-2 neighborhood mixed use district to B2-1 neighborhood mixed use district.

The next aldermanic application number in the 35th Ward is 8495, 35th Ward. The ordinance was referred on July 24th of 19. Common address of this one is 2643 through 2651 North Milwaukee Avenue.

And the change request is a B3-3 community shopping district to a B3-1 community shopping district. Next is application A is an alderman 8498, 35th Ward. The ordinance was referred on July 24th of 2019.

This common address 2620 through 2634 North Milwaukee Avenue. The change request, B3-3 community shopping district to B3-1 community shopping district. The next item is aldermanic application 8499, 35th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on July 24th of 2019. The common address 3334 to 3350 West Diversity Avenue. The change request is B1-3 neighborhood shopping district and B3-2 community shopping district to a B3-1 neighborhood shopping district.

These are all Alderman Ramirez-Rosa. For the benefit, as I said earlier, we had received numerous, not numerous, but at least five or six letters really questioning this. And of course, those of us that were on the public comment period, we heard a couple of people that were in strong opposition to this, and we heard people that were in support of it.

So for the record there. All right, Alderman Ramirez-Rosa.

[Speaker 8] (6:05:12 - 6:10:07)
Thank you so much, Chairman and committee members. I know it's been a very long day. Last term, Logan Square Community Organizations that participate in our 35th Ward community-driven zoning and development process requested that Milwaukee Avenue from Kedzie to Central Park be rezoned to preserve the existing built environment and reflect the land use and zoning policy supported by local residents.

In response to this request and in line with our 35th Ward community-driven zoning process, I held a public meeting to solicit community input on the community's rezoning proposal. Over 150 people participated in the meeting and an overwhelming majority, 80%, supported the rezoning. While the majority of the community feedback we received last term was in support of the rezoning, I also heard from residents and local businesses who felt the rezoning was too expansive.

Listening to the community's input, I introduced a scaled back and more precise rezoning of Milwaukee Avenue at the July 2019 Chicago City Council meeting. Rather than proceeding with a blanket rezone of Milwaukee Avenue from Kedzie to Central Park, a rezone that would have impacted 99 parcels, my community seeks to rezone just 14 parcels on Milwaukee Avenue between Kedzie and Central Park. The rezoning of these 14 parcels is to align the zoning of Milwaukee Avenue with our community's land use and zoning policy that seeks to spur economic development, curb demolition of existing buildings, and preserve the existing built environment and main street feel along Milwaukee Avenue business corridor.

These rezonings will help bring the parcel zoning in line with their existing density and use and or the density and use of neighboring buildings. And in so doing, help preserve Milwaukee Avenue's built environment. The classification and allowable uses will remain the same, business.

The rezoning will only change the allowable density. B2-2 becomes a B2-1. This will limit any future development on the parcels to 38 feet or maximum of three stories, which my community has consistently said they feel is the appropriate as of right development for the stretch.

And research shows will help us preserve this corridor's main street feel. This change from B2-2 to B2-1 will also bring these parcels into conformity with neighboring and adjacent parcels along this corridor, which are also zoned dash one. Implementing this land use and zoning policy along the Milwaukee Avenue corridor becomes more important during this economic downturn.

By aligning a parcel zoning with its existing density and use, we hope to spur economic development and investment in these properties by signaling to the market that what you see is what you get. In so doing, we hope to limit speculation and disinvestment in these properties. We are seeing effective land banking at work in the corridor with property owners and developers sitting on empty properties that could otherwise be used productively.

The rezoning of these parcels promotes the rehabbing and immediate use of existing properties so we can see a walkable and bustling commercial corridor within the stretch's existing envelope. I've spoken several times with the law department over the last several days. Based upon those conversations, I've agreed to continue to review one item where the property owner has threatened to sue and there are lingering questions.

Although I am confident that a review of these lingering questions will find that any threat of suit is without basis. I would like to hold item A-8497 until the December 15th zoning committee meeting to allow additional time for this review. But I ask for and appreciate the committee support and advancing the six other 35th ward rezoning items on the agenda today.

8493, 8494, 8495, 8496, 8498 and 8499. Thank you to the community groups, individuals and businesses who participated in our community driven process to discuss our community's land use and zoning policy along Milwaukee Avenue. And thank you to all of my colleagues that I have spoken to.

An overwhelming majority of this committee that are supporting my community enacting our land use and zoning policy today. Your support is so greatly appreciated by not just me, but by my ward and community that have been working to enact our land use and zoning policy since 2017 along this stretch. You have received letters of support from Logan Square Preservation and Logan Square Neighborhood Association, the largest neighborhood based organizations in the impacted stretch.

Their volunteers have diligently worked on and researched this measure for years. And they are so thankful to see their hard work moving forward today. We were elected to represent our communities.

These rezonings represent my community's land use and zoning policy, which my community seeks to enact. I ask the committee to hold A8497 and vote do pass on the six other 35th ward Alderman items before the committee today. Thank you.

[Speaker 14] (6:10:14 - 6:10:18)
Chairman Alderman Sawyer, if there are no questions, I move do pass on the remaining items.

[Speaker 2] (6:10:19 - 6:10:19)
Second.

[Speaker 14] (6:10:20 - 6:10:24)
Second. Second. All right.

[Speaker 1] (6:10:24 - 6:10:35)
Alderman Riley's hand up first and I'm calling on Alderman Riley first and then we'll get to your motion Alderman Sawyer. Alderman Riley.

[Speaker 12] (6:10:40 - 6:10:41)
Sorry, can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (6:10:41 - 6:10:42)
Yes, we can.

[Speaker 12] (6:10:43 - 6:12:02)
Thank you, Chairman. So during our colleagues presentation of the multiple down zones proposed, the potential for litigation was mentioned. And I understand one of the parcel owners may be threatening to litigate.

And that is why our colleague has chosen to exclude that item. But it's my understanding we heard from other opponents earlier this morning during public comment period about other parcels within this area. And as such, perhaps it'd be good for, it doesn't sound like there's an imminent threat to these properties this month, at least as far as I have heard so far.

Would it not be prudent to hold this item for another month to make sure there's consensus and to ensure the city will not be sued because that does place other zoning activity by this committee at risk if other items are challenged in court and for some reason are found to be spot zoning or unconstitutional. So as such, I would ask this committee to consider deferring these items one month and would move to do so.

[Speaker 1] (6:12:03 - 6:12:12)
So Alderman Riley, you're making a motion to defer these items for one month. Is that correct?

[Speaker 12] (6:12:13 - 6:12:13)
That is correct.

[Speaker 1] (6:12:14 - 6:12:18)
All right. Hearing the motion, roll call.

[Speaker 24] (6:12:18 - 6:12:21)
I thought it was a motion already on the table. Say aye.

[Speaker 1] (6:12:22 - 6:12:23)
I motion to lay that on the table.

[Speaker 24] (6:12:23 - 6:12:24)
It's already a motion on the floor.

[Speaker 56] (6:12:24 - 6:12:29)
It's already a motion on the floor and it was seconded. You can lay that motion, I motion to lay that on the floor.

[Speaker 24] (6:12:30 - 6:12:33)
Lay that on the table. All right.

[Speaker 1] (6:12:35 - 6:12:43)
Brendan, is the will, we're gonna lay it on, there was a request to lay it on the table. We need a roll call vote on that? I think we need a procedure.

[Speaker 12] (6:12:43 - 6:12:48)
We need a roll call. Is it my motion?

[Speaker 1] (6:12:49 - 6:13:05)
Hold on a second. Hold on. We have Law on the call.

Can we get someone from Law? I don't know if Jeff is on or Lisa or someone. Hello?

[Speaker 40] (6:13:07 - 6:13:16)
Hey, Lisa's on the phone, or is available, but I think this is a procedural issue and I see Vicki Kraft is on the call.

[Speaker 27] (6:13:17 - 6:13:19)
Yes, Alderman, I'm on the call.

[Speaker 1] (6:13:23 - 6:13:47)
Alderman Riley made a motion to defer these items for the month. Prior to that, Alderman, well, Alderman Sawyer Yeah. Made a motion move to pass on the items.

So I'm asking- You move on that motion.

[Speaker 37] (6:13:48 - 6:13:51)
Well- Alderman Sawyer's motion.

[Speaker 1] (6:13:51 - 6:13:54)
Let me hear from Vicki, please. Okay.

[Speaker 27] (6:13:56 - 6:14:26)
Well, Alderman, so again, just to make sure that I have this correct, there was a motion to- Do pass. To do pass. That was on the table.

And then following that motion, there was a motion to defer. So the motion to do pass, if I understand is a motion to move on the previous question. Is that correct?

[Speaker 1] (6:14:26 - 6:14:52)
Well, the issue was that I said for the record that I did not recognize Alderman Sawyer. I recognized, as I said on the record, that Alderman Riley had his hand up. We listened to the testimony.

Yes, Alderman Sawyer, who was not recognized by me as the chair, made a motion move to pass technically without getting recognized.

[Speaker 27] (6:14:52 - 6:14:56)
Right, in that case, in that case- Well, I guess that's the truth.

[Speaker 24] (6:14:56 - 6:15:03)
Come on, Tom, come on, Tom, don't do that. Yeah, he had already made the motion and it was two other people to second it.

[Speaker 27] (6:15:03 - 6:15:33)
But anyways, Vicki, based on what I just said, whether or not my colleagues disagree with it, what is your- My opinion would be under those circumstances, the rules provide that you have to recognize the person who is speaking in order for any motion that they make to go forward. And so to my way of thinking, that would mean that the motion to defer is the motion that's currently on the table. Alderman Riley's motion.

[Speaker 56] (6:15:33 - 6:15:37)
So there's a motion to lay his motion on the table. Lay that on the table.

[Speaker 1] (6:15:39 - 6:15:54)
Hey, a motion to lay a question- We're gonna get through this, okay? So hold on, Alderman Beal brings up the fact that that motion of Alderman Riley was moved to move- Lay it on the table. Lay it on the table, lay it on the table.

[Speaker 27] (6:15:55 - 6:16:22)
Okay, so according to rule 25, a motion to lay a question on the table shall not be debatable. A motion to lay on the table, it says, but a motion to take the question from the table may be proposed at the same meeting at which the question was laid upon the table, provided that two thirds of the aldermen vote therefore. So those would appear to be the rules.

[Speaker 1] (6:16:24 - 6:16:33)
Let's translate that for us to the members. So we do a roll call on the motion to lay on the table or the motion to defer.

[Speaker 27] (6:16:33 - 6:16:53)
I believe you have to do the roll call on the motion to lay on the table because according to rule 21, the motions shall take precedence over each other in a certain order and laying on the table takes precedence over the motion to defer. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (6:16:54 - 6:17:06)
All right, so then the roll call will be on the laying on the table of Alderman Riley's motion and it would need two thirds of the committee to do that.

[Speaker 27] (6:17:07 - 6:17:34)
No, it looks like the motion to lay on the table, right, it's the motion to take the question from the table, which requires a two thirds vote. The simple majority. The rules don't specifically state, I'm assuming it's a majority if they don't specifically state otherwise.

[Speaker 56] (6:17:34 - 6:17:37)
Simple majority rules on a motion to lay on the table.

[Speaker 37] (6:17:37 - 6:17:42)
I believe rule 25 said motion to lay on the table required two thirds vote.

[Speaker 27] (6:17:42 - 6:18:11)
Well, rule 25 says no emotion. I can read it to you. It says a motion to lay a question on the table shall not be debatable.

A motion to take a question from the table shall not be debatable. This next sentence doesn't seem to apply. It says a motion to take any question from the table may be proposed at the same meeting at which such question was laid upon the table provided two thirds of the Alderman vote therefore.

[Speaker 34] (6:18:12 - 6:18:15)
So- Motion to lay on the table is majority.

[Speaker 27] (6:18:16 - 6:18:27)
Yes, I believe the motion to lay on the table is majority, but then at the end of all of this, it seems to me that with a two thirds vote, Alderman Riley could motion to remove it from the table.

[Speaker 12] (6:18:30 - 6:18:32)
Correct. Chairman Tony, I agree.

[Speaker 34] (6:18:32 - 6:18:37)
This is Alderman Riley. I agree. Okay, well, hold on.

There's been no such motion. We still have to do with the motion that's in.

[Speaker 1] (6:18:37 - 6:18:56)
That's why our attorney is on the call. I told my process to the attorney, she's responding. And now I understand that we're gonna take a roll call, but Alderman Riley, what is your question?

[Speaker 12] (6:18:56 - 6:19:27)
Chairman, I just wanted to acknowledge what our attorney has just said. And that is that I believe we need just a simple majority vote on the motion to lay on the table. If there's a motion to remove from the table, which is a separate motion altogether, that would require two thirds.

But that's not what is before us now. I believe their simple majority is necessary to lay a motion on the table. And Vicki Kraft, you're comfortable with that?

[Speaker 27] (6:19:27 - 6:19:30)
Yes, that seems to be in accord with the rule.

[Speaker 1] (6:19:31 - 6:20:06)
All right, then let's take the roll call. All right, so this is on Alderman Beal's lay on the table motion. So if you are voting, correct me if I'm wrong, if you're voting yes on this, you support laying it on the table.

And obviously vote no if you don't. All right, okay. Alderman Hopkins?

No. And Alderman Dowell?

[Speaker 18] (6:20:09 - 6:20:14)
Chairman, yes vote means laying, you agree to lay it on the table, right?

[Speaker 1] (6:20:15 - 6:20:29)
Correct. Yes. Okay.

Alderman Sawyer? Aye. Alderman Beal?

Yep. Alderman Ray Lopez?

[Speaker 37] (6:20:30 - 6:20:31)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (6:20:33 - 6:20:34)
Alderman David Moore?

[Speaker 59] (6:20:35 - 6:20:35)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (6:20:37 - 6:20:43)
Alderman Mike Rodriguez? Aye. Alderman Sicho Lopez?

[Speaker 61] (6:20:44 - 6:20:44)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (6:20:46 - 6:20:59)
Alderman Burnett? Yes. Alderman Roboyes?

Aye. Alderman Cardona?

[Speaker 61] (6:21:01 - 6:21:03)
Yes, aye.

[Speaker 1] (6:21:04 - 6:21:10)
Alderman Wagesbeck? Yeah. Aye.

Alderman Kerry Austin?

[Speaker 10] (6:21:11 - 6:21:11)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (6:21:13 - 6:21:19)
Alderman Villegas? Aye. Alderman Riley?

[Speaker 61] (6:21:20 - 6:21:20)
No.

[Speaker 1] (6:21:23 - 6:21:34)
Alderman Capelman? Aye. Alderman Osterman?

And Alderman Hatton?

[Speaker 54] (6:21:35 - 6:21:35)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (6:21:36 - 6:21:51)
Okay. And Chairman Toney votes no. But our total is, say it again.

I've got 15 to three votes. Well, 15 on the yays.

[Speaker 7] (6:21:52 - 6:21:54)
15. 15 yays, three nays.

[Speaker 1] (6:21:54 - 6:22:04)
And three nays. So the item is, the motion was laid on the table. Mr. Chairman. And that is Alderman Hopkins.

[Speaker 4] (6:22:05 - 6:22:19)
I move to defer item 497. So what's the total on item number? 8497.

I'm sorry, ordinance 8497.

[Speaker 9] (6:22:20 - 6:22:21)
Alderman saw you ahead of motion already.

[Speaker 1] (6:22:23 - 6:22:32)
Well, wait, we first of all heard from the Alderman Ramirez Rosa, I believe that he was, that was one that he wanted to defer.

[Speaker 61] (6:22:33 - 6:22:34)
Yeah.

[Speaker 1] (6:22:34 - 6:22:39)
That was 8497. Is that correct, Alderman Ramirez Rosa?

[Speaker 8] (6:22:40 - 6:22:41)
Yes, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (6:22:41 - 6:23:14)
Okay. So I think that takes precedence over, first of all. So I'm going to, Alderman Hopkins, who's a member of the committee, makes a motion to defer item number A8497.

To defer that previously read item. And all those in favor of that. Point of information, Chairman.

And that is.

[Speaker 21] (6:23:14 - 6:23:23)
Alderman Rodriguez. Okay, Mike. Yeah.

Just a question for Alderman Ramirez Rosa. Is he in concurrence with this motion? I just want to be clear.

[Speaker 8] (6:23:24 - 6:23:41)
Yes. Thank you. Thank you so much, Alderman Rodriguez for asking.

As I noted in my statement, I am comfortable with holding A8497 and holding that until December 15th. But the other six items, I would appreciate if they pass today. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (6:23:42 - 6:24:38)
Thank you. So since, wait, wait, wait. Let me just get, let me get back to reiterate that there was a motion to defer this item from Alderman Brian Hopkins, a committee member.

So I'm going to ask all those that are committee members they to vote in favor. I'm asking, are they voting in favor of deferring item A8497? All those in favor of deferring.

Aye. Those that are opposed. So in the opinion of the chair, item number A is Apple 8497, commonly address 2643 through 2651 North Milwaukee Avenue is deferred.

All right.

[Speaker 18] (6:24:38 - 6:24:39)
Excuse me, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (6:24:40 - 6:24:45)
Hold on now. This is a point of information, Alderman Dowell.

[Speaker 18] (6:24:45 - 6:24:58)
Yes. Can I just have the sponsor, Alderman Ramirez Rosa, just state, I know we voted on it. I want to follow this.

So I want to understand why he's asking for a deferral of this item.

[Speaker 1] (6:24:58 - 6:25:05)
The one part, this one particular set of addresses. Alderman Carlos Ramirez Rosa.

[Speaker 8] (6:25:06 - 6:26:04)
Thank you. So this particular property owner is very litigious. He previously sued to stop my community's land use and zoning policy when we sought to build the 100 unit affordable housing development, just a few feet away from here.

So we know that he is willing to sue. He's done it in the past. We're going from a B3-3 to a B3-1 on this particular parcel, which is a little different from the B2-2s to B2-1s.

So on this one, I feel like, you know, I would like to engage in more review with the law department. I'm pretty confident that everything is in line here. This is part of a cohesive community plan.

We've done our research. It's pretty clear what's going on here. But on this one, just because, you know, he has sued in the past, I think that it's important that, you know, we cross our T's and dot our I's and just really make sure that he has no case here whatsoever.

But based upon the preliminary... Thank you.

[Speaker 18] (6:26:04 - 6:26:04)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (6:26:05 - 6:27:10)
All right. Now we have, I think we're gonna have testimony on the remaining six. If the sponsor would like to say more, we have a couple of hands up, but I just wanted to give my colleague, who's the sponsor of these aldermanic applications, the remaining six, an opportunity, if he would like to...

You talked about the other ones that are B2-2 to B2-1, but my... Why are you dragging yourself? Well, it's, you know, process takes a while, but Carlos, just for the record, the next application, it was 8498, also does a B3-3 to a B3-1.

Just... And would you wanna comment on that? Why that one would be different than the one you deferred?

Because they...

[Speaker 8] (6:27:10 - 6:27:12)
No one has started to sue on that parcel.

[Speaker 1] (6:27:13 - 6:27:34)
No, no. I think we sent you confirmation that that one was also. The one at the 2620 through 2634.

Where there's a dash three going down to a dash one? Well, the request is B3-3 to B3-1. Hold on.

I don't have any record of that.

[Speaker 61] (6:27:34 - 6:27:36)
Hold on a second.

[Speaker 9] (6:27:44 - 6:27:44)
Hi, Nicole.

[Speaker 1] (6:28:05 - 6:28:41)
Yesterday, there were four, I believe, that were potential litigation. I know we do have, and I think if the committee members have it there, I'm sure we have the one on that one. But point being that that is a similar change of zoning from B3-3 to B3-1.

Yeah. And it's from Felix. I think it's from Felix.

Cardona. Cardona. Not the Felix Cardona.

He's a junior now that I see it.

[Speaker 58] (6:28:42 - 6:28:42)
Not me, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (6:28:44 - 6:29:03)
All right. All right. That's what we think.

So, be that as it may, I just want to make sure that I think we had that one being objected to formally to the committee. All right.

[Speaker 37] (6:29:04 - 6:29:05)
Point of information, Chairman. Alderman- Yes.

[Speaker 1] (6:29:06 - 6:29:07)
Alderman Ray Lopez.

[Speaker 37] (6:29:07 - 6:29:28)
Hello, Jessica. Thank you, Chairman. I just want to- Yes, I can hear you.

I just want to be clear about something. So, are we, is it going to be our practice moving forward that anytime someone submits a letter threatening to sue the city, that we're going to start moving on the decision?

[Speaker 1] (6:29:28 - 6:29:31)
No, that's not setting precedent.

[Speaker 37] (6:29:32 - 6:29:33)
All right.

[Speaker 24] (6:29:33 - 6:29:34)
Yes, that is.

[Speaker 37] (6:29:35 - 6:29:36)
I'm sorry, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (6:29:36 - 6:29:45)
Anything that's in the public record that's submitted to our committee, we certainly educate our- Mr. Chairman, point of information. Yes.

[Speaker 18] (6:29:45 - 6:29:51)
You are challenging the alderman that is asking for all of the rest of his items to be passed.

[Speaker 1] (6:29:51 - 6:29:54)
No, I'm not challenging him anything.

[Speaker 24] (6:29:54 - 6:29:57)
I know- Yes, you are, because you keep telling him what somebody else has said.

[Speaker 1] (6:29:57 - 6:30:40)
No, I was asking if we had record on a different application, same change of zonings, that I wanted to make sure that since he postponed one of them with the same classification, we had letters of potential lawsuit on the other one. And I just wanted to make sure that he had received that and he questioned that he hadn't received it. And that's why I followed up with it.

So, I'm not, I'm going to leave that as it may. I appreciate your constructive criticism. I'm going to ask Carlos, would you like to speak on the remaining?

I think it's six.

[Speaker 8] (6:30:40 - 6:30:48)
You know, my colleagues have had a very long day today out of respect for them. I believe a number of them have their hands up and they are committee members.

[Speaker 1] (6:30:49 - 6:30:58)
So, okay. So now we'll ask on the motion or not the motion. Well, the motion for the other six, we have Maria Hadden.

[Speaker 24] (6:31:00 - 6:31:07)
Thank you, Chair. So are you recognizing the motion from Alderman Sawyer or are you entertaining another motion?

[Speaker 1] (6:31:10 - 6:31:22)
Well, since it was, since Alderman, since Riley's motion was laid on the table, we are entertaining a motion by Sawyer.

[Speaker 24] (6:31:23 - 6:31:33)
Okay, then I will not make that motion because that's why my hand was raised. So I don't know procedurally what's next, but can we vote on the motion if you're entertaining that from Alderman Sawyer?

[Speaker 1] (6:31:34 - 6:31:37)
I got just two of our colleagues, I hope.

[Speaker 24] (6:31:37 - 6:31:37)
Thanks, Chair.

[Speaker 1] (6:31:38 - 6:31:44)
And then we'll get a roll call. All right. Anthony Beal, Alderman Beal.

[Speaker 56] (6:31:45 - 6:31:53)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just had a quick question. All of these automatic zoning changes are basically for future land plan usage.

Am I correct?

[Speaker 1] (6:31:54 - 6:31:58)
Well, I'm gonna defer to the sponsor on that one.

[Speaker 56] (6:31:59 - 6:32:12)
Yes. Okay, Alderman Beal. Is to continue just to give the community further dialogue on what happens in the community and to be able to have input on what happens in the future, correct?

[Speaker 8] (6:32:14 - 6:32:38)
We're seeking to align our land use and zoning policy along Milwaukee Avenue with the existing built environment. For many of these, we're simply bringing the parcels underlying zoning in alignment with what's currently there. But anytime that anyone has a zoning change or proposal that requires zoning relief, we run that through our community process and ensure that there's a community input aspect where the community decides what moves forward.

[Speaker 56] (6:32:38 - 6:32:47)
Okay, great. And that's pretty much in line with what we do historically in this body. You know, whenever there's an automatic zone change for future land plan usage.

So thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (6:32:47 - 6:32:52)
All right. And before we take a vote, I have one hand up and it's Alderman Riley.

[Speaker 12] (6:32:54 - 6:33:58)
Thank you, Chairman. I wanted to acknowledge just for the record because my colleague, Alderman Ramirez-Rosa is engaging in land use planning. My concern was purely regarding the litigation aspect.

I do not question our ability as aldermen to drive community dialogue about good land use planning in neighborhoods. So I don't want that to be misconstrued or confused by my colleagues. It was purely that I had been informed through the committee and others that there was threats of litigation on multiple down zones and sailing into those waters can be tricky.

So I just wanted to consider giving that 30 days to breathe, but obviously that's not the will of the body, but I certainly do not question any one of my colleagues seeking to do down zoning to encourage better community planning. That said, I moved the previous question and would request a roll call vote.

[Speaker 27] (6:33:59 - 6:34:05)
So now we're taking a roll call on the motion to defer. Correct? No.

No.

[Speaker 12] (6:34:05 - 6:34:06)
Wait, wait, wait.

[Speaker 24] (6:34:06 - 6:34:10)
So Alderman Riley, you're asking- This is on the motion to pass.

[Speaker 12] (6:34:10 - 6:34:19)
This is on moving the previous question on Alderman Sawyer's motion to defer. So, all right. All right, I don't want to necessarily revisit the link on the table.

[Speaker 1] (6:34:20 - 6:34:53)
All right, this motion will be on roll call voting yes means to recommend to the full city council the six applications in Alderman Rosa's ward. And obviously if you vote no, you don't support. All right, so let's start on the motion.

Alderman Hopkins, Alderman Dowell.

[Speaker 18] (6:34:53 - 6:34:54)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (6:34:56 - 6:35:44)
Alderman Sawyer. Aye. Aye.

Alderman Beall. Yep. Alderman Ray Lopez.

Aye. Alderman David Moore. Aye.

Alderman Mike Rodriguez. Alderman Rodriguez. Alderman Sitio Lopez.

Aye. Rodriguez is an aye, sorry. Mike Rodriguez is an aye.

Alderman Burnett. Aye. Alderman Ravoyos.

Aye. Alderman Cardona.

[Speaker 36] (6:35:45 - 6:35:45)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (6:35:46 - 6:35:47)
Logs back.

[Speaker 36] (6:35:48 - 6:35:48)
Yeah.

[Speaker 47] (6:35:50 - 6:35:51)
Pardon me.

[Speaker 1] (6:35:51 - 6:36:05)
And Austin. Chairman. Aye.

Aye. Was there someone is, no, okay. All right, Alderman Villegas.

Yes. Alderman Riley.

[Speaker 12] (6:36:06 - 6:36:06)
Aye. Aye.

[Speaker 1] (6:36:08 - 6:36:18)
Alderman Kappelman. Aye. Osterman.

And Alderman Hadden.

[Speaker 24] (6:36:18 - 6:36:19)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (6:36:20 - 6:36:24)
And Chairman Tony is an aye. Alderman Hopkins votes aye.

[Speaker 40] (6:36:25 - 6:36:26)
19.

[Speaker 1] (6:36:26 - 6:37:11)
Okay, on the motion, we have 19 yeas and zero nays. So the ordinance is passed and will be recommended out to the council. On December 16th.

On the 16th. Now, just, you know, Nicole, I just wanted to bring her into the picture because we're not gonna re-argue the question, but on the question about when a lawsuit is potentially threatened, members of this committee know that it has been done at least two or three times. We had an issue about the double door, which we deferred in the zoning committee to get further study.

And we also did it, I believe with more recently with Nick Sposato on the Copernicus Center, if I'm not mistaken, or which one?

[Speaker 30] (6:37:12 - 6:37:13)
It was around, it was Lawrence and Austin.

[Speaker 1] (6:37:14 - 6:37:50)
Lawrence and Austin. So while answering Raymond Lopez's question, every application is gonna be studied on its own merit and it'll be the wish of the body as to how they react to it. So with that said, I believe our agenda is complete.

Can I get a motion to adjourn? So moved, Chairman Alderman Lopez, without a loss. Alderman Ray Lopez moves to adjourn and everyone have a good evening and thanks for your patience.

Sometimes it was awkward on my half, but certainly out of no malintent to anybody. Okay.

[Speaker 7] (6:37:50 - 6:37:51)
Thanks, Chair. Evening.
