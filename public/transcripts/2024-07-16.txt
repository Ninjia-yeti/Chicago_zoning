[Speaker 24] (25:32 - 25:34)
is not in the room we'll come back danny via lobos

[Speaker 17] (25:35 - 28:25)
will be followed by aileen garaspe good morning my name is danny via lobos and i'm a resident of vidim park on the southwest side of the city even though adus have been taken off the agenda today i still want to speak on this issue because it is a crucial and essential type of housing that should not be delayed any further i'm from the bungalow belt so take my word when i say i support the development and expansion of accessory dwelling units in our community i believe that adus are a solution tailor-made for communities like mine working class single family residencies multi-generational immigrant multi-racial and underserved considering the city doesn't have the budget capacity to invest heavily in our communities at the very least let our people invest in themselves by allowing homeowners to add these units to their properties we could skyrocket the supply of homes without costly subsidies and get household incomes rising by letting homeowners themselves become landlords this fresh supply would help stabilize housing prices and make our neighborhoods more affordable and inclusive for a diverse range of residents including young professionals retirees and working families i've seen the uptick in homelessness in vidim park people priced out of our neighborhood and larger multi-generational families squeezed into single bungalow households for too long unimaginative planning and neglected development along the bungalow belt has eroded the economic strength of our city's very own backyard meanwhile the coastal front of our city continues to brim with wealth and opportunity i want that same investment in upward mobility for the bungalow belt adus should be by right citywide especially within single family zones without any red tape barriers or further delays we need to think bigger act faster and make strides in making chicago the most pro-development progressive city in the country and it should start with a truly revenue generating bungalow belt that increases spending in our local economy in conclusion i hope to provide you with a firsthand positive residential perspective adus would reinvigorate the bungalow belt breathe new life into our community and get incomes moving and so adus are not in spite of the bungalow belt but for the bungalow belt speaking to our values of social justice economic prosperity and environmental beauty please take this critical step in the strengthening of the bungalow thank

[Speaker 1] (28:25 - 28:32)
you for your time thank you sir uh next is eileen garaspe followed by jessica jackson

[Speaker 14] (28:33 - 31:48)
is brett pollock here good morning my name is eileen garaspe i'm a resident of 111 south morgan street directly adjacent to the mary bottle may park and also directly adjacent to the proposed 112 south sangamon development proposal that's on the agenda today i was present at one of the committee meetings of one of the community organizations in which the developers presented their proposal to us i have significant concerns and significant opposition to this proposal that i wanted to discuss here today when asked developers could set forth no tangible benefits to the community they vaguely mentioned more tax dollars to the city but not specify exactly what amount that entailed or whether such tax dollars would exceed any potential tax breaks which developers plan to utilize because of such development they also argued more residential units means more safety which is highly disingenuous here given that the pre-existing safety of the area reasonably stems from the existence of the directly adjacent mary bottle may park when pressed further developers were unable to come up with any other potential benefits to the community this is the biggest issue that i and so many others have about this development proposal and why so many adamantly oppose it for context the previous 112 south sangamon proposal which was approved in 2017 consisted of one large residential unit intended for the building owner's own part-time occasional use the current amended proposal consists of three units instead of one unit however developers at the meeting were unable to disclose whether any of these units would nonetheless be used for the building owner's own part-time occasional use as initially intended this supports the notion that not only are there no tangible benefits to the community itself but all of this is evidently intended solely to benefit the building owners and their own part-time occasional convenience this proposed add-on conflicts with numerous provisions in the west loop design guidelines and notably these guidelines were not adopted until after the process of approval of the previous 2017 proposal this ruined aesthetic with the uneven street wall and inconsistent block street block base that the proposal would entail is especially significant given that mary bartelmay park which is directly across the street attracts thousands of residents from west loop and all over chicago throughout the year as a west loop resident myself and a two to three times daily mary bartelmay park visitor this park is our neighborhood jewel green city farms market is held directly on that street below not to mention movies at the park and other community events held at mary bartelmay park we love our neighborhood we love our park and we cannot allow outside developments to wreak havoc on our enjoyment of the park for no legitimate reason and or community benefit whatsoever lastly i have concerns about the 2017 zoning amendment approval process for this property one of the building owners scott mazel was president of the west loop community organization in 2017 when that same organization on information and belief held the city mandated community hearing prior to the official zoning approval given this apparent conflict of interest as well as the lack of any actual community input as described by myself and others i believe that this zoning approval

[Speaker 1] (31:48 - 31:54)
was questionable at best thank you miss garrospe uh next is jessica jackson will be followed by

[Speaker 15] (31:54 - 35:03)
lachan bryant um good morning and that young lady that just finished speaking um i want to thank you for coming before me and give an opportunity for me to see that it's not just us that they ignore they ignore everybody they're rude to everybody and so i want to thank you for letting me see that this morning because for a while it looked like that um type of actions was taken just against us because we're coming here talking about our concerns talking about the community talking about how the black community is not getting any resources talking about how they're coming in here stealing our property while they build up on the north side but they steal from the south side and they have gone through so many things to keep us from coming in here including things like locking everybody out outside and making us all stand out there because it means just that much to them that they give us a hard time and that they discriminate against us so thank you for showing me this morning and giving me some peace of mind that it's not just us it's the behavior of our public officials and i hope that everybody sitting here looks at this look at who you voted into office look how much they do not care about your well-being look how they're coming in here today to do some more stealing they got corporations in here that's getting ready to come up and they're going to come up on the backs of the less fortunate they're going to come up on the backs of what they call their marginalized the vulnerable communities every last one of them getting ready to leave out of here with a promise of a bad every last one of them they don't care that our communities are being infiltrated by a bunch of illegal immigrants that we don't know who they are where they're from they're not vetted we don't know what diseases they're bringing over here we don't put them in our schools around our innocent children they could care less what they want is some money is greed it's the American way to be greedy and to come back come up on the backs of the less fortunate so here they are they're irritated they're agitated they're moving in their seats they're mad about it but they're gonna keep getting mad because this is America and we got the freedom of speech and we're gonna keep on utilizing our freedom of speech just like you all got the freedom to enterprise and to engage in capitalism we got our freedoms too and we're gonna deal with our freedoms so keep on making your little rules

[Speaker 1] (35:03 - 35:17)
we'll be back thank you Miss Jackson I want to remind members in the gallery to please take a seat unless you are speaking thank you uh let's next up is LaShawn Bryant followed by Andy Lawrence

[Speaker 36] (35:35 - 36:35)
good morning I'm here to speak on landmarks of High Park Union Church that sits on 5600 and Woodlawn and I'm a member of that church and I'm also the space sharing manager there and I wanted to share with you about what our building is doing our building is used for not just beautiful stained glass windows not just a service on Sunday we're using our building for a food pantry we're using our building to outreach the community we're using our building to foster the university students and other students abroad Chicago so today when you think about us think about the building itself as not being a relic because that's not what we are we're very active in the community we are very active in Chicago and our pastors are definitely for social justice and yeah that's what I wanted to share with the council today just look at our building beyond just a brick and mortar that it does house what Chicago stands for which is the city that works

[Speaker 1] (36:35 - 36:42)
and we're working in our building thank you thank you very much Miss Bryant uh next up is Andy

[Speaker 19] (36:42 - 39:06)
Lawrence followed by Amy Zander hello hello my name is Obby Lawrence um yeah no don't worry about it okay um so my name is Obby Lawrence and I'm actually speaking into the mic a little bit more there we go um I grew up in Rogers Park and I currently live in Uptown right now and I'm coming here to speak on the ADU issue which is one of many housing things I'm passionate about because as we know um housing is skyrocketing in many parts of the city becoming much more affordable so um yeah like to speak on that so um I find it disappointing that the ADU issue is not being voted on today um it of course is not a silver bullet to our housing issues but they should absolutely be allowed to be developed by right homeowners should be allowed to use their land as they see fit to increase the supply of housing in this city without subsidies Chicago is becoming increasingly more unaffordable to live in and yet we continue to allow red tape to prevent housing construction I hope that the alderman here will move quickly to approve the ADU ordinance citywide I also hope that the alderman here will move to cut other red tape and allow more housing by right um yeah that's all I wrote but um thank you guys I appreciate your work um I really just hope that we can do more to allow housing of all types um I know it's kind of a hot button issue right now but um in my community and and you know especially in Uptown Rogers Park where I'm from um it's really concerning the upward trend of rent and we're not doing anything to allow housing to match that demand um I know a lot of us here are passionate about allowing more affordable housing below market housing I want all of that you know I want housing of all types and I just wish that um we can allow people to want to move to the city allow you know to live here and be able to afford without the burdens of housing costs so that's all I have thank you thank you Mr. Lawrence

[Speaker 34] (39:06 - 40:16)

[Speaker 18] (40:23 - 43:02)
Blakemore good morning my name is Stephen Vance uh normally I would have been here for like the third month in a row to talk about ADUs but I'm gonna leave that comment for the next meeting I want to talk about Western Avenue upzoning today actually uh so I'm also a member of the Urban Environmentalists Illinois a membership-based advocacy group so there are two ordinances on the zoning committee's table today for uh the start of a new wave of land use policy to increase development where it's needed along Western Avenue after the completion of the Western Avenue corridor study two years ago Alderpersons Haddon Martin and Vasquez are taking the necessary next step by codifying some of those that study's recommendations into zoning map updates so the study recommended that higher density mixed-use developments be allowed and encouraged along Western Avenue to fill in the many vacant properties as well as to allow the corridor to develop from one that primarily serves people using cars and car-oriented businesses to one serving people who arrive on all kinds of transportation modes and in the future it can provide the density that is supportive and takes advantage of a bus rapid transit network the zoning map changes mean that nearly all of Western Avenue from Addison Street to Howard Street will have b3-3 zoning allowing mixed use and residential buildings up to four and five stories tall with 20 to 40 homes each as of right which means that is a way that property owners and developers won't need to get individual approval for each one developments will still have to comply with the affordable requirements ordinance or the aro when all alders task themselves with approving each and every proposed development new housing is often delayed raising the cost of development and denying people access to new affordable and accessible housing and as the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development found segregation in the city is perpetuated the proactive Western Avenue upzoning is a form of housing abundance and can speed up development of new housing in neighborhoods where it's most in demand and where there's existing transit infrastructure and amenities a secondary benefit of proactive upzoning is how it attracts new development in Chicago because of the ease of development new development is one of the city's best strategies to deal with funding pensions because new development means there are new and more taxpayers new development eases property tax pressure on existing taxpayers please pass the two Western Avenue upzoning ordinances today I also look forward to seeing and supporting more proactive upzoning ordinances in the 40th 47th and 49th ward as well as two that have been proposed recently in the 35th ward

[Speaker 1] (43:02 - 43:10)

the record my name is Butler Adams I don't have much to add but the first speaker Danny talked about ADUs I just want to say I know that's off the agenda right now but I am in favor of that I do think there should be something that citywide it's something that will help not only affordability but also maybe to help increase density so that's something that I am for and I hope that it gets worked out in committee so that it can come before this committee again and be voted on in terms of passage um there was also also new ones on here about upzoning uh uh Western Avenue I'm for that as well but I don't have much to add so I'm just saying that I'm pro upzoning of both of those and I hope that it happens thank you and I do hope hope also that other aldermen look at uh streets and their wards to possibly upzone to not only allow more density but also to increase the population instead of nickel and diming the city as a whole let's add more people to increase uh the population of the city as a whole thanks

[Speaker 10] (53:38 - 53:55)
matters well this would be this would be a matter of first impression for me as this is my first um foray into public service um but it would be a critical it would the alderman's voice is a critical um stakeholder in in these types of decisions so it would be a very important um

[Speaker 25] (53:55 - 54:12)
very important consideration and for what you've seen um and you have to know about zba in some form of fashion what are some value-added uh things you want to um bring to zba absolutely I

I'm all about efficiency and making sure that we're we're streamlining um processes I know that the cut the tape initiative has been very well received and um and I look forward to implementing those those real changes um if they are passed um I believe that I have a fair and balanced view of interpretation of laws and regulations and I think I can really add um the community perspective as well because the work that I do day in and day out is in community across all of Chicago

[Speaker 21] (54:55 - 57:02)
all right uh alderman kutson swathy I might not have a question because we talked yesterday which was wonderful I wanted to just say that um I highly recommend you I think you're so qualified for this with your community work and also as an attorney a former obama obama leader uh in the obama leadership program which is incredible um and just to say that I'm happy that although two years later my my vacancy is uh being filled with such an amazing applicant I think that two years shows that um we've got to kind of keep up the work on our end to make uh make these things happen faster and make this board function better um this board as many people in this room know it only works when it's filled um uh and I think there's there's several ways to improve it um uh you know we're talking to the we talked to the deputy mayor's team um about the awesome work that she's doing on the cut the tape initiative and maybe some items in there that can go into zba such as the burden that sometimes zba puts on small business owners first time business owners in paying um consulting fees in order to just appear it's a cover charge in a way it's coming into chicago business I think that there is a way for zba to lead on equity for for people who want to just do good business in the city or do a project to their home wherever you are in the city um so I want to say thank you um I want to quick just plug an ordinance I'm introducing tomorrow to make sure that alternates on the zba which there are two of can fill in for vacancies right now they can only fill in for regular members which has created um a little bit of gridlock on the zoning board so um uh you know thanks steve vance and daniel spotter for the help on that and um i'm excited about filling zba in and um uh selfishly excited that uh you're filling my vacancy

[Speaker 1] (57:02 - 57:56)
so thank you thank you alderman thank you alderman any other questions comments by committee members seeing none alderman moore moves do pass all in favor say aye any opposed nay in the chair the ayes have it and will be reported out tomorrow congratulations thank you uh next is the direct introduction of the appointment of helen schiller as a member of the zoning board of appeals for a term effective immediately and expiring july 1st 2029 to succeed zurich esposito whose term has expired at this time i would like to ask for a motion to accept the direct introduction alder knutson makes that motion all in favor say aye they oppose nay in the chair the ayes have it appointment is before us committee members received a copy of alderman schiller's resume electronically as well as in the packet before them and we have the alderman here to introduce herself morning morning thank you uh i think i

[Speaker 23] (57:56 - 59:57)
know most of you and um and i know that you know that i was an alderman for many years um i interacted with the zba during those 24 years and had both positive and negative experiences uh in in much in the vein that men that have already been mentioned in terms of the time it takes to get stuff on the agenda in terms of the cost especially for some of the special uses that we created in the council and um didn't meet the intent of which was really to ensure that there was a community voice but one of the consequences has been that we've made it very unaffordable more less and less affordable for many small businesses to be able to get the approval they need for various different things when that wasn't the intent the intent was really to create uh the best uh best outcome for any given community as well as the businesses so i'm really looking forward to this opportunity um i think that it's really important that the alderman be respected um in in any process here not just because well one primarily because they really know their awards but not just in order to be able to get their input about what they think or what you think is the best process or the best outcome but also to get an understanding of the context because you're the best people uh to be able to inform us of the things that we don't necessarily know but you know when taking into consideration something that's going on and that's really important i think in the context also of hearing the voice of the community members as well so we can understand what we're really hearing and are able to really use some critical thinking to respond but we have to know and have to be able to interact with the alderman on every in every single instance i'm really looking forward to this it wasn't something i was really had been on my agenda i'm kind of surprised myself but i really do welcome your support if i um and i hope that uh you will provide it and so that i'm able to actually serve on this board i'm looking forward

[Speaker 1] (59:57 - 1:00:02)

[Speaker 5] (1:03:44 - 1:08:25)
to answer questions mr clayton you may proceed hi good morning for the record my name is lewis clayton with the department of planning and development i'm here today to give a brief overview of the proposed designation of milwaukee avenue as a special character overlay district otherwise known as an scod and the design guidelines for existing buildings and new construction the proposed scod covers properties along a two-mile stretch of milwaukee avenue from western avenue in the south in the first ward to ridgeway avenue in the north in the 35th ward the scod excludes landmark buildings landmark districts and existing plan developments this project was initiated to study and address the rapid development in the corridor and concerns about the loss of neighborhood character within the corridor over a thousand new residential units have been added since 2000 including these 16 developments that were completed since 2007 an scod is a type of overlay district which applies in addition to base zoning requirements an scod aims to reduce conflicts between new construction and existing development encourage city beautification and conserve this character of the city's most unique neighborhoods there are several existing scods located throughout the city however this would be the first that includes detailed design guidelines the purpose of the design design guidelines is to maintain and enhance the unique character and sense of place along milwaukee avenue providing a level of certainty to property owners investors developers and the community at large over the past year and a half we've received broad community input through an online survey interviews with key stakeholders and working group sessions involving city representatives aldermanic staff special interest groups and community advocates we've also hosted five community meetings with over 300 attendees for both the third and fifth community meetings we mailed over 1,800 notices to property owners within 250 feet of the scod boundaries three guiding principles emerged from the community engagement process forming the basis for the design guideline the first is to maintain character defining features that contribute to the scod sense of place and built environment the second is provide flexibility and applying in applying the design guidelines supporting complementary new construction repairs and improvements and the third is to maintain and improve the streetscapes unique character by ensuring it remains compact mixed use walkable and pedestrian oriented the design guidelines will only apply to new construction or existing building modifications requiring a building permit application or zoning map amendment internal review for compliance with the design guidelines will occur within the regular application review period the design guidelines are organized into two categories existing buildings and new construction each set of guidelines is organized by individual design components like materials heights windows and storefronts each section includes guideline categories context and background about each category guideline subcategories specific numbered guidelines and photos and illustrations of acceptable and unacceptable examples with cross references to specific guidelines the design guidelines for existing buildings address materials first floor facades exterior facade repair or replacement entrances and doors to upper floors upper floor facades windows and roofs and additions the design guidelines for new construction address parking and service areas buildings set back in orientation height and scale massing and building width materials ground floor entries and storefronts and articulation at upper floors in addition to the proposed design guidelines the scod introduces a new demolition notification requirement for character buildings which were constructed between 1870 and 1960 and helped to find the study areas physical attributes within the scod 125 character buildings have been identified which is 55 percent of all buildings while the scod cannot prohibit demolitions or alter the existing citywide demolition delay ordinance we propose a new requirement for notifying the local alderman at least 30 days before submitting a demolition permit application for a character building this will give aldermanic offices early notice to contact property owners and explore potential preservation options that concludes my presentation and i'm happy to answer

[Speaker 1] (1:08:25 - 1:08:59)
any questions you may have at this time great thank you uh wanted to add all those ramirez rosa and hopkins both for the roll call as committee members um and then turn it over to do we have to go 49 all right one real quick uh alderman mosley has requested attendance to invite remote meetings of provisions of rule 59 although the spot it makes the motion to approve alderman mosley's request all in favor say aye opposed say nay and pending chair the ayes have it welcome alderman mosley um i will turn it over now to who would like to start alderman lespada thank you so much

[Speaker 6] (1:08:59 - 1:10:54)
chair thank you colleagues um uh thanks to lewis clinton for the great presentation just a couple quick thank yous to folks who are not in the room uh one to carmen martinez our regional planner from dpd who has been such a stalwart partner through this entire process i remember being on the zoom where i feel like she first came to us with a vision of utilizing this process this ordinance as a way to guide development along this corridor and it's been a really remarkable journey um i also want to thank among many people the two individuals who submitted letters of support today andrew schneider from logan square preservation milda esparza the executive director of our logan square chamber of commerce the input from them from their membership um has been essential in what we've been able to bring forward because what you're not what you're seeing here is not dpd and alderman ramirez rosa and alderman lespada going down the corridor and say we like this building we don't like this building we like these bricks we don't like these bricks it was driven by our community through our community through just the most detailed and genuinely participatory process been a pleasure and the last thing that i'll say because people talk about bureaucracy and tape a lot as a developer i would imagine that what i want is predictability and as lewis said consistency i don't want to spend the first six months guessing what what does the older person and their community want to see from this lot in terms of design density height we we've laid out design guidelines and requirements that i would estimate are going to cut months and months off of the development process along milwaukee avenue and i'm really excited to have been a part

[Speaker 13] (1:10:54 - 1:14:09)
of it thank you alderman ramirez rosa thank you so much um i'm really excited that we are voting on this matter here today to institute the land use and zoning policies that our community has been looking towards for a very long time logan square preservation for many years has worked to expand landmark districts in and around uh the square a number of buildings along milwaukee avenue have been landmarked but not every building rises to the level required for landmarking and so it was in february of 2020 uh when then commissioner cox was doing a tour of wards i don't know if you all remember that he was out visiting all the wards across the city that we sat down at the conference table in my office with representatives from logan square preservation by lincoln logan square neighborhood association and we talked about what makes milwaukee avenue special we talked about the historic character of that stretch the main street feel we talked about the diversity both in the businesses and in the people so importantly and we talked about what tools were available to us to build upon our community strengths and he said have you all thought about a special character overlay district um it's a form of uh zoning uh it's a tool that you can use to protect those character buildings and to help promote um rehabilitation of existing buildings and to help promote development and investment that is in line with the historic main street feel of the community and uh we started looking at that tool we approached alderman laspada we approached then alderman wagaspak who at that point had a stretch of milwaukee avenue in logan square and we wrote a letter to dpd saying hey we want to move forward with this process and we're very happy that we were able to allocate tip dollars to bring on a design consultant who did an amazing job i really want to thank them and meticulously went through and engaged the community but also looked at what milwaukee avenue looks like what are the character buildings uh and provided us with clear design design guidelines which as my colleague alderman laspada said these design guidelines will provide investors and developers with predictability you no longer need to be guessing what does the community want to see now you know if you build to these design guidelines you will be able to build as of right and get your building built um so this is really exciting um you know the passage of this today also opens up other tools to us for example we're now looking at proactively up zoning a number of parcels along milwaukee avenue because we know that thanks to the aro past last term those buildings would have 20 affordability um and we also know that now thanks to this special character overlay district they will be uh built uh and uh designed in such a way that complements the historic character of that stretch so i really want to thank everyone involved and again do just want to bring to attention the two letters of support in your packets from the logan square chamber of commerce and logan square preservation uh it was uh the community coming together to push this forward that got us here today and so with that i would ask our colleagues support in implementing this policy for our wards thank you thank you all there's uh all the women down yes i have one

[Speaker 7] (1:14:09 - 1:14:30)
question i might have missed this i understand that the demolition uh notification if a building is going to be demolished the notification goes to the alderman of that district what happens to permits that who's reviewing the design guidelines to make sure that they're being followed yeah so

[Speaker 5] (1:14:30 - 1:14:42)
thank you for the question uh the review of compliance with the design guideline will happen within dpd uh within our uh planning group uh assigned to the northwest region all right so

[Speaker 7] (1:14:42 - 1:14:55)
does the design review committee still exist in tpd yes it does but it's going to be done within the dish if in the neighborhood planning division correct okay thank you right because typically

[Speaker 1] (1:14:55 - 1:15:11)
design review wouldn't happen on a project this size yes for uh by right projects those do not go through design review under most circumstances even i know zoning changes this size we've asked for it we would like for more impact from dpd which they're generally very happy to to provide

[Speaker 5] (1:15:11 - 1:15:17)
yeah so so this review will happen at a staff level right right great thank you other questions

[Speaker 1] (1:15:17 - 1:15:40)
by committee members um i actually had one i think you uh answered it though about upzoning because my office is working with the north region team on something very similar um and doing those assessments but this is is this a p street the pedestrian street so it's it's sort of p street plus then right you've got the design there's nothing exempted from the p street guidelines

[Speaker 5] (1:15:40 - 1:15:46)
right yes uh well this would be in addition to the right that was my question great that's it

[Speaker 1] (1:15:46 - 1:16:38)
anything else all the women down moves do pass all in favor say aye all opposed say nay then the chair the ayes have it the item is passed as amended thank you uh mr clinton uh next we have an ordinance introduced by alderman tell your farrow document number oh 2023-0005724 an amendment of the municipal code title 17 by modifying various sections and adding new section 17-9-0130 regarding indoor event venues this item has a substitute committee members will find a copy of the substitute ordinance as well as the summary in your packets at this time all the ramirez rosa moves to accept the substitute all in favor say aye all opposed say nay then the chair the ayes have it item is substituted we have alderman tell farrow uh here with us remotely to present

[Speaker 3] (1:16:40 - 1:20:29)
how's everyone doing and thank you so much chairman for um and members of the committee for calling this item uh this this substitute that's before you today um is is an attempt to bring some type of regulation around the operation of event spaces um that currently operate um as a matter of right um regardless of proximity to others um other event spaces it operates and they operate as a matter of right um chicago media headlines um are i should say are not lacking uh with stories about violence and mass shootings at event spaces um that is to some degree are unregulated in fact um over the last holiday weekend and then even the months prior to that i'm in the month of june there were several mass shootings um at unregulated event spaces um one in my ward that was a chat room um that um turned into an event space um i've been approached by numerous um somewhat aspiring entrepreneurs to say you know i like to operate i'm an event space with the with the good intent really um to have bridal showers that hold bridal showers and baby showers and gender reveal parties but um at some point they always seem to turn into late night um operations that that host private events and oftentimes you know that leads to uh businesses that become a nuisance for the community rather than being a community asset um and so i'm hoping with this ordinance that we can some time some kind of way regulate um a lot of the businesses that operate will propose to operate as event space by proposing a a special use procedure that they must go through where you know whereby dpd would review it and um um there's a public hearing notice that are given to the residents as well as there's considerable consideration regarding operational impact in communities that they affect um i think this adds a a procedure where we can somehow control um how many event spaces and where they pop up in fact uh just as an example on madison on the 5900 block and and this was a good friend of mine that uh decided decided to open an event space and in fact it was operation without operating without issue um and and had some good clientele that came in uh one of the young ladies that utilized that particular facility loved it and thought it was a a great idea and opened up another event space next door to it and unfortunately on the 5900 block of madison there was a party at both places one night and um there was a shootout that occurred and an innocent bystander was shot and killed that story is not just one that appeared in the 29th ward but it happens all over and so that we've been working with this ordinance so i've had an opportunity to work for this ordinance with bacp and the law to try to have minimal impact on businesses that are currently operating in the city of chicago with great intended purposes but to give regulation behind some of the um the ability of a business to operate unregulated um for purposes of destroying private parties um so chairman again thank you so much for allowing me to bring this before your committee and the members of your committee and i i would hope your favorable consideration

[Speaker 1] (1:20:30 - 1:20:37)
on this matter thank you uh alderman talia farrell do i have questions by committee members

[Speaker 7] (1:20:42 - 1:21:00)
saying none sure uh alderman yes thank you i just want to hear how the zoning division reviewed this and opined on this murphy with the department of planning development so we worked

[Speaker 26] (1:21:00 - 1:21:21)
with the acp and the law department uh and the alderman to go through the ordinance talk about the new special use standards that are included in this and also the impacts that it could have to bcp's uh liquor and and ppa uh enforcement so we did work with the alderman on the ultimate drafting of this language and the regulations that are in there regarding the new requirements

[Speaker 7] (1:21:21 - 1:21:41)
for a special use and am i reading this right that anyone that currently has a p or if you don't want this does not apply to those that want a ppa i would want to make sure with bacp about

[Speaker 26] (1:21:41 - 1:21:51)
how they're going to discern between those two groups uh so i don't want to answer for them as far as the ppa applicability unless alderman you might have information from discussions with

[Speaker 3] (1:21:51 - 1:22:26)
chesap i have not but the ppa would be a separate and distinct process than requiring a requiring a business here to go through the special use process um i think they would i don't think there would be any um and and again i would i would rather um um shannon trotter or or someone with liquor commission or bcp opine on it um but as i believe it it would not affect um those well i think there's a separate process um chairman uh the ppa process and the special use

[Speaker 26] (1:22:26 - 1:22:38)
process yeah yes those are still too many there's those are still maintained as two separate processes but okay that that is true that is correct but wait i think my understanding was that

[Speaker 1] (1:22:38 - 1:22:47)
this would apply to those businesses that did not have a ppa yes right and would not be seeking a ppa

[Speaker 26] (1:22:48 - 1:22:57)
may not be um i i don't want to go too far into how this may impact some of their ppa regulation

[Speaker 1] (1:22:58 - 1:23:16)
i'm sorry no fair enough uh bcp is not here i don't believe i don't know if law wants to how well versed uh we are on this let's get this issue or do you have something else on us

[Speaker 42] (1:23:17 - 1:23:49)
uh hi lindsey sunnenthal law department um i don't i also bcp is not here i don't i can't answer for their exact process but the way the substitute has been written it is i believe anyone who is um who has a ppa license or would need a ppa license so it might not be everyone who seeks a ppa license if they didn't need one yeah and chairwoman chairwoman dolly

[Speaker 3] (1:23:49 - 1:26:01)
you know within a language of also um the substitute um it gives an example of um uh somewhat entities that that this does not apply to um i know um for entertainment purposes we may have hotels that apply for ppas um this does not affect them or a lodge or private clubs um religious assembly so there is a list of um establishments that are in the substitute um that it applies um does not apply to rather and many of those apply um for ppa licenses um as a matter of their operational sustaining a viable operation um what it does also state that it gives an example um you know of a list not it's not inclusive but it does give a list of businesses that it is applicable to and they are your more smaller type be like wedding receptions uh banquets um your more smaller events um as i said earlier we have a host of businesses in my ward that want to open um for the purpose of doing baby showers or wedding wedding showers gender reveals bachelor parties uh bridal events um but ultimately i always ask the same question is okay when you know 10 o'clock p.m hits um and and the baby gender reveal party is over what happens and oftentimes many of them stay open to one two o'clock in the morning they pass the keys on to their cousin and the place stays open as a party so it it's specifically designed um and it it gives that limited purpose um to those smaller type events rather than the larger events that will seek um a ppa license so it does somewhat distinguish um in the language itself the types but although both lists are not inclusive and i mean by the list that would typically apply for ppa in which it does not apply to in the list that um um this ordinance would affect the smaller type um banquet halls or indoor event spaces

[Speaker 7] (1:26:01 - 1:26:13)
i hope that answers a little not really but um i would have to speak to bacp thank you

[Speaker 6] (1:26:13 - 1:26:40)
thank you so much chair audwin tell me a fair as you talk about i i think i see what you're driving at because it's what i might colloquially call a private place of amusement that that is to say i lease out a 1500 square foot making commercial space i put up some paint and now it's an event space does this sound like what you're talking about because i've seen quite a

[Speaker 3] (1:26:40 - 1:28:07)
bit of this and in the first ward as well it does and you know and another problem that we're having alderman as well we have although it's regulated under a different mechanism we have dance studios that operate by day as a dance studio and then at night it turns into an event space we have barber shops that operate by day as a barber shop but at night it turns into an event space party lease equipment by day at night it's an event space that's a different mechanism that um you know needs to be regulated by bca bacp enforcement but we do have those that are open perhaps like what you're referring to as well that open with the sole purpose of i want to operate strictly as an event space from you know whatever hours we can operate and they can do so as a matter of right there is no special use process or there is no process that will give an alderman to say well you're opening up next door to another event space uh that's not such a good idea but they do so anyway and so i think if we can somewhat regulate um the number in the record regulate the the location and the proximity to another then we may be able to help reduce violence and that occurs at a lot of these um event spaces i do understand what you're driving

[Speaker 6] (1:28:07 - 1:28:25)
at here because i it's something that i feel like you you you have to perhaps seen it and felt it and those kinds of spaces in your ward to understand the need for that kind of uh regulation but i i do very much understand what you're driving at and i i support the ordinance you're

[Speaker 1] (1:28:25 - 1:28:50)
putting forward thank you alderman any other questions by committee members um i am not entirely comfortable uh passing this without having the acp here to answer some questions um but would take the temperature certainly of my colleagues obviously uh alderman tally farrell has worked on this um so at this point i would entertain a motion of some kind

[Speaker 7] (1:28:53 - 1:29:12)
yeah i'm uh if uh if this is okay with the alderman to hold it for the until the next zoning committee meeting i'm fine with that to seek out the answers that i have from bacp but if not he wants to pass it i'm willing to go talk to bacp on my own i would also be willing to

[Speaker 1] (1:29:12 - 1:29:17)
hold it till later in the meeting if the acp could join us uh if all the entire affair if that

[Speaker 3] (1:29:17 - 1:29:32)
works for you no i i have no objection to that um and you know that's fine with me i i do have a couple things going on but i will um alderman down would you um need me to be present no i don't need

[Speaker 33] (1:30:06 - 1:31:22)
of planning development here to present this matter hello as you just said candalyn hon department of planning and development um before you is a proposed landmark designation for the hyde park union church at 5600 south woodlawn this was approved by the commission on chicago landmarks earlier this year the commission voted that this church meets three criteria for landmark designation first for heritage due to its connections with the university of chicago and the wider community of hyde park for its architecture richardsonian romanesque structure that was designed by architect james gamble rogers so that meets the third criterion for the significance of the architect he constructed this building in 1906 and later an education wing was added in 1926 this landmark designation proposal came about because the church requested it they've been great stewards of the church and as i believe you heard earlier also have many programs that benefit the wider community we do have the support of alderman desmond yancy um and request your support to make this a chicago landmark thank you

[Speaker 9] (1:38:51 - 1:41:28)
it over to alder vazquez thank you very much chairman um uh and colleagues uh members of the zoning committee uh i am extremely proud and happy to be here today um to start uh the first baby steps of the legislative changes to rezone western avenue um this was um a large endeavor that took a number of years we want to thank um commissioner boltright uh as well as catherine hurd uh daniel crider and tom bolino from the department of planning and development who put forth the western avenue corridor study which really looked to reimagine what is the current western avenue uh section uh those of you everyone who lives in the city knows that western avenue typically is a auto vehicle uh business kind of uh stretch uh not the most walkable uh not the variety of businesses one might want to see in a in a section but a really great opportunity to actually increase density bring affordability and really look at the future what the city can be so the western or western avenue corridor study in looking at what could be done really thought about creating neighborhood centers and redefining what we can see as far as the businesses that would be at the ground level so by uh changing it to b32 and in some places b33 it envisions creating the density that's necessary to really support local small independent businesses that could be setting up and really moving it from being an auto car centric sort of stretch to what it can be as we have conversations about bus rapid transit about making sure we think about pedestrian safety and really increasing the affordability that we know is necessary in the city in the city this kind of hits all those marks it checks all the boxes my largest concern when we first were moving in this direction was the loss of affordability if people were then creating by right once the zoning change occurred but after uh conversation um with pat murphy and other folks in the department uh it remains that the aro um requirements are part of this zoning change so as such knowing that we can increase affordability knowing that we can reimagine re-envision and reinvigorate western avenue i'm extremely supportive of this endeavor uh we'll have more coming as we know the 47th ward the 49th ward are also going through the long stretch and invite the rest of our colleagues who have western going through their wards to join us uh and the opportunity to really create the kind of chicago we all want to see so i ask all the members of the committee for their

[Speaker 1] (1:41:28 - 1:41:33)
favorable support thank you very much chairman thank you alder uh do i have questions by committee

[Speaker 6] (1:41:33 - 1:42:37)
members almost vada thank you so much chair um yes alderman vasquez it's a really brilliant piece of legislation here i remember the day i said to my staff i feel like alderman vasquez is reading the aro ordinance wrong and they're like actually sir you're reading the ordinance wrong and the the way that it's written now to encourage and actually mandate affordability entitlements through the zoning change uh on the automatic introduction side i find fascinating i find your use of both the zoning code and the revised aro fascinating in this case particularly along western which you know sir that i also have a particularly long stretch of i i will my only question is because when people submit a letter i feel like it's worth hearing them out on the letter can you speak to the concerns voiced by uh mr levitt from wheels of chicago yeah absolutely

[Speaker 9] (1:42:37 - 1:43:32)
so uh and i i appreciate you bringing the point up uh also we when we read uh the legislation we had to double check that as well right obviously those of us that want to see affordability want to make sure that that's not lost in the equation but as it relates to to the um the public comment um what this does to the existing businesses is in effect nothing right they remain their grandfathered in they're able to continue their business model but what it does is it signals to future businesses coming in that if they are of certain designation they're just going to have to get a zoning change to be able to do so at which point it goes back to the zoning process we haven't afforded yet so if someone's got an auto business uh an auto body shop which isn't allowed in b33 but it's existing there uh they don't get kicked out or anything they continue their business so it doesn't affect them uh because we're thinking more you know 15 20 50 years into the future as to what we want western to look like that's very helpful thank you so much

[Speaker 1] (1:43:32 - 1:44:01)
sir thank you terry thank you any other questions by committee members um seeing none i uh just wanted to add the piece about affordability um because i'm also working with these great three planners from the north side district so we need to get them off of western and onto clarkham broadway um so let's wrap western quickly but right that we're able to proactively rezone to build a community plan and keep the affordable requirement is something that's really key for a lot of us when we're looking at that so i really appreciate you bringing that up yeah chairman also

[Speaker 9] (1:44:01 - 1:44:32)
also to that point i think we know um when we're trying to get development happening in places that aren't downtown river north right or the hot spots um people are really concerned about the zoning process and say well i don't know if we can build the density necessary i think doing these proactive zoning and really reimagining allows you to signal that to development to say look we're open to going higher and figuring out what this looks like and so i um i guess that's a quick shout out for those who want to look at western avenue as an opportunity it ain't just downtown of chicago anymore so thank

[Speaker 1] (1:44:32 - 1:45:26)
you chairman got it all right um seeing no other hands uh alderman citro lopez moves do pass on item number a eight eight nine two and a eight eight nine five all in favor say aye any opposed say nay in the chair the ayes have it um all right i'm going to move back there's all the faro still with us no all right um back to item number oh 2023-0005724 from the 29th ward amendment municipal code title 17 modifying various sections adding new section 179013 regarding indoor event venues we have been joined by distinguished representatives from the department of business affairs consumer protection um commissioner trotter uh go ahead and introduce yourself and and who is with you max and chris

[Speaker 12] (1:45:26 - 1:45:38)
um sure good morning uh shannon trotter local liquor control commissioner here on behalf of the acp and with with me is deputy commissioner max budovich great thank you both so much all the

[Speaker 7] (1:45:38 - 1:45:58)
woman down yes good morning shannon um if i'm reading this ordinance right all this ordinance does is um prevent uh or say what the distance should be between venues is that accurate no

[Speaker 12] (1:45:59 - 1:47:33)
what this ordinance does is that it's meant to um catch those who probably are doing ppa activity but evading the ppa requirements which are much more rigorous so it's yours as the alderman um spoke when he described the ordinance the an exception to the ppa license is that if you are under 100 and you are not charging for an event meaning you're hosting a private baby shower birthday party you would not be in the ppa lane and um alderman tolly faro explained that this is where he is seeing the violence in his community at these types of venues so what it does is make those that do not require ppa licenses but our event venues um go through a more rigorous process and that they will have to give a parking plan a security plan a um there are four requirements just one second yeah there were four i saw a traffic study and proof of adequate off-street parking okay so you're basically catching those businesses that wouldn't have the more rigorous checks and balances go through the special use process where um some ppas would still require special use but not all do but with the ppa license you do have aldermanic community input oftentimes law enforcement input so that is a more rigorous process that those licensees that are those that are seeking that license where are already going

[Speaker 7] (1:47:34 - 1:48:02)
so these um venues are just put through a more rigorous process there is a distance limitation that i saw of 660 feet um but we still have to go through the process of catching them when they do decide that they're going to use promoters or have after parties that doesn't change

[Speaker 12] (1:48:03 - 1:48:31)
well there's there's an enforcement component regardless of licensure or lack thereof entirely we will always have enforcement for entirely unlicensed venues that aren't going to be forthright but for those that come to bacp and tell us that they legitimately want to be an event venue and don't have the more rigorous ppa application this provides community safeguards those that those that are liars are doing illegal activity we will have to address

[Speaker 7] (1:48:31 - 1:48:45)
through enforcement okay and these are all still subject to plans of operation if the alderman so desires to see one done anyone with a ppa can be subject to a operation ppa these uh

[Speaker 12] (1:48:45 - 1:48:58)
indoor event venue people so what it requires is is a plan of operation but that will be part of the special use it would not be enforced by bacp it would be enforced by um dpd and patrick's team

[Speaker 7] (1:48:58 - 1:49:15)
because it would be part of the special use right i have that part my question is can plan of operations be done for these type of businesses no no it would be all of the

[Speaker 12] (1:49:15 - 1:49:32)
requirements those four elements that they're required to prove to establish the special use will be made part of the special use and that special use is subject to enforcement the same as the plan of operation would be for a public place of amusement license

[Speaker 7] (1:49:34 - 1:49:49)
see that's that's my concern is some of these businesses you still need to watch them because they operate outside of their license so a plan of operation gives the alderman i think an ability

[Speaker 12] (1:49:49 - 1:50:21)
to hold them more accountable i i don't want to speak for alderman taliaferro i i did raise i'm not speaking for him i'm speaking for me yeah i i did raise this point with him um and i i think what what his thoughts were was that there is an enforcement mechanism just as there is for a plan of operation that the alderman would have input in given that the special use involves the alderman and the four requirements that are laid out in his ordinance okay thank you mr chair i

[Speaker 1] (1:50:21 - 1:50:51)
know what i have to do thank you all the women dow um any other questions from committee members on this almost bada let me hear the motion okay i actually have some okay thanks um i mean all right i have a few questions actually um do we have any license uh of 100 or under that we require a traffic plan for currently i mean your head maybe that that could be a zoning question

[Speaker 26] (1:50:51 - 1:51:19)
yeah i would defer to patrick on that well we have certain industrial uses uh particularly those that trigger the air quality ordinance that will require traffic plans uh there would be other parking requirements that are triggered outside of zoning regulations like for health clubs for instance but not anything crafted particularly like this for a relatively speaking not as intensive use as some of the other industrial uses that i was referencing

[Speaker 1] (1:51:20 - 1:51:30)
right because there's no short answer is no right so this this is covering venues of 100 or less right anyone over 100 has to get a ppa for this type of use if they're if they're hosting

[Speaker 12] (1:51:30 - 1:51:35)
events that are open to the public they would require a ppa but even if they were over 100

[Speaker 1] (1:51:35 - 1:51:41)
and the events were all still a private space if they have a retail food license and are

[Speaker 12] (1:51:41 - 1:51:50)
operating as a banquet hall that would be an additional exception to the ppa code okay

[Speaker 1] (1:51:53 - 1:52:48)
all right uh all of them espada you wanted to make a motion motion all right all of them espada moves do pass all in favor say aye any opposed say nay uh pity the chair the ayes have it uh we'll report it out thank you all for coming down appreciate it all right back to the map amendments we are ronnie mosley are you on the zoom we gotta get a hold of him let's see what we can do okay all right middle of page three all right we'll keep rolling mr chair i'm here ah right alderman mosley all right we're on the top of page two document number a 8888 in the 21st ward ordinance referred 5 22 24 common address is 113 50 south paulstead street change request plan development number 131 to b31 community shopping

[Speaker 1] (1:53:42 - 1:54:16)
questions by committee members seeing none alderman conway moves do pass all in favor say aye any opposed say nay the chair the ayes have it the item is passed thank you alderman mosley thank you um middle of page three document number 22488 in the 27th ward ordinance referred 6 12 24 common address is 2100 or 2110 west warren boulevard change requests an rt4 residential two flat townhouse multi-unit district to rm5 residential multi-unit district

[Speaker 8] (1:54:16 - 1:56:39)
um we have attorney steve friedland uh yes thank you mr chairman good morning again my name is steve friedland with the law firm of applegate and thorn thompson here on behalf of saint leonard ministries i have with me zach trance who's the executive director and ivory snow who's the chief administrative officer i think the easiest way to explain this rezoning request is from looking at the campus picture that you have on the screen saint leonard ministries has a sort of a mini campus at warren and hoying in the city and the property in question is the one that is at the corner of hoying and warren boulevard it's listed there as a saint leonard's house 2110 to 21 and 2100 west warren these are buildings that have been used as transitional residences for ex-offenders since 1981 when saint leonard's obtained a special use for that use and what saint leonard's is planning on doing as you can see they've really developed a number of buildings in the campus area here they want to rehabilitate and and refurbish those two transitional residences and one of the things that they want to do is add an elevator to the rear of the 2100 that's the white roof building that you see at the corner the rear of that building there would be a small addition that would house an elevator the issue is that in the rt4 they exceed the height for that that new elevator addition and the purpose of this rezoning is to allow in the rm5 district for the elevator to be deemed a conforming structure so that that that's the request but saint leonard's as you can see has really developed this area and this rezoning will allow them to continue that rehabilitation redevelopment project be happy to take any questions you can see on this drawing in the area in the black uh behind that building on the corner is where the elevator

[Speaker 1] (1:56:39 - 1:56:47)
uh addition would go great thank you uh before we go to i think alderman brunette is on zoom alderman

[Speaker 31] (1:56:47 - 1:57:23)
conway thank you mr chairman uh i am recusing myself on this matter under rule 14 uh the rule indicates that i have to um publicly disclose in detail the reason for this uh the reason is that my father is a significant donor to to saint leonard's or or soon will be uh and and helping ex-offenders get back on their feet i am of course proud of him for it but after speaking with mr berlin he he told me that i should have refused myself out of an abundance of caution under rule 14 and i have already notified stacey haskins and the clerk's office of this in writing thank you

[Speaker 16] (2:00:37 - 2:01:17)
once again we have nick fatigas thank you again chairman for the record nick fatigas i'm here on behalf of the applicant and property owner uh regarding 5 10 south california avenue um the subject lot is a vacant uh parcel that actually is a budding property that our client also owns at 5 20 south california avenue so the zoning change request is to establish a uniform zoning district for the two lots um the improved lot operates with a gas station and car wash the uh proposed uh 3300 square foot lot would be used for additional accessory parking um we did work with alderman burnett and participated in a community meeting uh and i believe we have

[Speaker 1] (2:01:17 - 2:01:25)
the alderman support to proceed uh today great uh thank you mr fatigas um we do have uh again

[Speaker 32] (2:01:25 - 2:01:49)
vice mayor burnett on the call yeah thank you mr chairman mr chairman i would be remiss if i did not mention uh with the last project that uh saint leonard's did meet with the local community organization that got their support on their project just for the record uh also on this one we did have a community meeting um it was unanimous a no-brainer that people supported this project so

[Speaker 1] (2:01:49 - 2:01:55)
support it also thank you great thank you vice mayor any questions by committee members

[Speaker 6] (2:01:57 - 2:02:08)
yes i'm just curious can they not do accessory parking by right with b3-3 they have to see

[Speaker 16] (2:02:08 - 2:02:45)
someone reduce right and it's actually um the property was originally up zoned back in the uh mid like 2005 2006 for a multi-unit residential development that never went forward um our client owned the first i believe it's five lots and got special use and zoning approvals for the gas station and car wash the neighboring lot came up on the market it's zoned separately so for consistency of zoning we just decided to go to the c1-1 and incorporated all as a single zoning lot also to avoid a split district between the improved property and the neighboring property

[Speaker 1] (2:08:06 - 2:08:18)
see there's an administrative adjustment as part of the application it may have started as a variation which it would have been a denial and go to the zba yes mr murphy uh yeah patrick

[Speaker 26] (2:08:18 - 2:08:38)
murphy from the department of planning it right when it started they could have been it would have been before the ordinance that allows for these types of relief to be rolled into a type one they could have been issued an administrative adjustment or variation which is what the denial reference alludes to and then they are possibly now refiling to absorb that in to avoid that
