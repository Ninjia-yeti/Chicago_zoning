[Speaker 8] (26:42 - 27:20)
A quick question before we get started because I was really hoping that we'd had a rules meeting today. All these new rules and regulations that are being put in place, it's the law department here that can answer some questions pertaining to, you know, we haven't voted on any of these rule changes, we haven't talked about any of these rule changes, and I'm just afraid that we're making unilateral moves that's going to put us in jeopardy of, number one, the Open Meetings Act and how this body proceeds.

So I'm very concerned about that and I was just wondering if anybody from law is here that can talk about these new rules that are being put in place.

[Speaker 1] (27:20 - 27:36)
Sure. So the rules I read have been read at all the previous committee meetings as well. The seating rules are not, the new rules that came out that were published are not in effect for the committee meetings.

So as far as the rules that I just read from law, you wanted to?

[Speaker 8] (27:36 - 27:51)
Well, yeah, I mean, even though the ones you just read, I know that, you know, everybody's been reading the same script, but I was just wondering if we're deviating from anything that we have not voted on and approved, you know. We'll ask law to address that.

[Speaker 1] (27:51 - 27:51)
Lizzie, go ahead.

[Speaker 17] (27:52 - 29:00)
Yeah. Hi, Lindsay Sonnenthal, Law Department. Basically, right now for any committee meeting, the chair has the discretion to add in certain rules that would basically allow people to only speak at, you know, at times that are appropriate for speaking, such as during the public comment period, and also in a way that is not disrupting, disruptive or is not distasteful and is harmful or harassing.

So right now these rules are not, right now these rules, regardless of whether they are approved and are said to be for every meeting based on the rules committee, which will have to happen if that will be a requirement, Vice Chair Lawson is allowed at this point to adopt them just for his own, as at his own discretion as the chair of this.

[Speaker 8] (29:00 - 30:10)
Well, I totally understand that the chair does have discretion, but the chair doesn't have discretion to shut the public out and change the rules. And I'm not talking about this chairman, I'm just talking about in general. So I just want to say, this is a general statement and observation that I have seen that we are changing rules in order to shut people out, to silence the public and basically to prevent the public from having access to their government.

And so I do understand that we do need order. However, order has been kind of thrown out the window as of late, and we do need to have order in this body. But I'm just really concerned that we are setting a dangerous precedence.

We've already been sued twice under the last two administrations. And I can bet you, if we continue down this road, we're going to be sued again with these new policies that we're putting in place that's keeping the public from speaking and having access to their government. So I just want to go on record as saying such.

[Speaker 1] (30:10 - 30:18)
No, I appreciate that. We're certainly not doing that today. We've only got the four, so they're all getting in.

And since he's at the mic, let's go ahead and start with George Blakemore.

[Speaker 13] (30:21 - 31:22)
Mr. George Blakemore, through Michelle Harris, being used by all the administrations, and now she's on the rule committee. What Altman was asking you, when did the public have an input in making these rules? When?

So the Sergeant of Arms is not an elected official. The Sergeant of Arms has no power. I was outraged when I read yesterday, I was over in Miss Felicity's office, Michelle Harris did not have that rule committee.

And how did she do that? It never went to the rules committee. The way it happened, the first group of officers that were sworn in.

[Speaker 1] (31:28 - 31:33)
If you're not on the mic, you're not going to be recorded for the stream.

[Speaker 13] (31:33 - 32:07)
To be heard, and I'm colorful enough to be seen. She used this illegally. It was supposed to go to the rules committee.

But she made this body the body of a whole, and it doesn't work like this. When you're getting ready to make a law, they got various committees. And each one of these committees have to meet.

And when they meet, they have to have the input of the citizens. So what you're doing is totally illegal.

[Speaker 4] (32:08 - 33:26)
The Sergeant of Arms has no power to make no rules. All of these officers make the rules in a rules committee, not in a youth and community. I went home, and I said, how did you do that?

So this is all being resourced. And we try to protect the services that all of us go home to. Before, I think nobody, but somebody, never seen somebody who did do that.

But all of you, and that's why Chicago is known to be the most corrupt city in the world, because so many of the elected officials have been invited. And then he tried to move on the railings now, but he's been treated, and he's been being molded. Thank you, Mr. Blakemore.

[Speaker 1] (33:26 - 33:39)
Your time has expired. Next up is Janita Tucker. We also have Alderman Reilly for purposes of quorum in the chamber.

[Speaker 10] (33:44 - 33:45)
Good morning.

[Speaker 1] (33:45 - 33:45)
Good morning.

[Speaker 10] (33:46 - 35:36)
My name is Janita Tucker. I'm the Executive Director of the Peterson-Pulaski Business and Industrial Council. We are a local industrial retention initiative under contract with the City of Chicago's Department of Planning.

I want to thank the Chairman Ramirez-Rosa and the distinguished committee to allow me to speak. Thank you, too, for taking up this ordinance that will allow all the tap rooms in Chicago to offer seating outdoors on a patio or rooftop, whether their property is zone manufacturing or not. Bottom line, patios and rooftops draw customers.

It is an opportunity for an option that is especially popular with Chicagoans wishing to make the most of fair weather. At a time when the craft brewing industry has yet to fully recover from COVID-related losses, it is good that the city is working to remove unnecessary hurdles in the way of their success. We don't want to lose them.

They are an important part of their communities. Their communities have fully embraced the whole taproom concept. In the six years since my local Alarmist Brewing opened their taproom, it has become an official gathering place for the neighborhood, a place where families and pets are welcome, where it is natural to strike up conversations, compare beers, and make friends.

In this age of social media and online interaction, it is important for the city to do what it can to keep these face-to-face gathering places. That is why I implore you to amend the zoning code to permit taprooms in manufacturing districts to have outdoor seating. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (35:37 - 35:50)
Thank you, Ms. Tucker. Next up, we have Ray Stout, Mr. Stout with the Illinois Craft Brewers Guild.

[Speaker 15] (35:51 - 35:51)
Hello, everybody.

[Speaker 1] (35:51 - 35:52)
Very appropriate. Thank you.

[Speaker 15] (35:52 - 37:15)
Thank you. Thank you for affording me this opportunity to speak with you today in favor of this important issue. My name is Ray Stout.

I am the Executive Director of the Illinois Craft Brewers Guild. We represent the 300 breweries across the state and the 70 here in Chicago. Our industry would not be where it is today if it was not for the great work that happened in this room.

Thank you, everybody. I would be remiss if I did not mention that Chicago was just named the best craft beer city in the United States by Craft Beer and Brewing, a leading national publication. But we are coming to you with an ask to please support the proposed ordinance to allow outdoor dining to continue for breweries operating in manufacturing zones.

Outdoor dining was a beacon of hope for these breweries throughout the pandemic, and it worked. We would not have 70 breweries in the city of Chicago today if it was not for those steps taken in this room, so thank you. But what it did do is change consumers' expectations when they're walking into a brewery.

And so you know what people quickly realize is that they like eating and drinking outside in Chicago. And so we're asking you not to let outdoor dining sunset for dozens of craft breweries currently operating in manufacturing zones and dozens more looking to make Chicago their home. So please support this proposal.

It is so vital to continued success of this industry. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (37:16 - 37:21)
Thank you, Mr. Stout. Our final speaker is Gary Gulley.

[Speaker 7] (37:33 - 40:35)
Hi, I'm Gary Gulley with Alarmist Brewing. We are in the 39th ward in the Sauginage neighborhood. Thank you everyone for letting me speak.

My wife wanted to be here, but she gets to hear me speak all the time, so she's happy she doesn't have to listen to me today. First, I want to thank this whole issue that we're talking about, this zoning thing. I brought this up at an alderman meeting with Samantha Nugent, had a meeting with BACP, State of the Union, or excuse me, State of the Ward meeting a few months ago.

And I stood up and I said, hey, does everyone know that we cannot have a patio license in a manufacturing zone? And guess what? A lot of breweries are in manufacturing zones.

And this is a very old part of the city ordinance, which makes a lot of sense. Why would you need outdoor dining in a manufacturing zone if you're making, you know, screws and sprockets? But then breweries started popping up.

So now we have a new situation and that's where I'm hoping this ordinance will kind of correct that. I don't know if anyone's read cranes in the last few weeks. I guess it was last week, but we've seen there's a lot of breweries have been closing in Illinois and here in Chicago and a variety of reasons.

And obviously COVID is one of the biggest, biggest parts of that. And when we were going through the COVID, the extended outdoor dining really helped us out a lot. Like it saved us.

It brought in thousands and thousands of dollars in revenue to the tap room that we simply wouldn't have. And just so everybody understands, when you have a brewery, you basically have two businesses. You have your tap room business, which is the most important part.

And then you have the other side of the business was distribution. The beer we send out to distributors to sell in stores and restaurants. But without a tap room, we all go out of business.

That's just the reality of the situation now. With this outdoor dining, I have customers now who cannot wait for our beer garden to reopen. So I'm hoping that this ordinance can pass so that we can continue doing that.

We, as in Alarmist, have invested thousands of dollars in what we call the courtyard. It's surrounded on three sides by a U-shaped building. And then the fourth side is a fence for the People's Gas Northside Operations Center.

We have put in landscaping. We have put in pavers. We have put in tarps and literally thousands of dollars and custom made picnic tables that were made here locally by a local carpenter.

So we've invested a lot of money in this and we would like to continue to do that. And the last thing I will say before I run out of time is that this has become a community space, this outdoor area we have. I call it a little urban oasis.

People love to come out there. Their kids can run around and play. We're not a crazy bar.

We don't have people running around drunk outside or anything. We're just a tap room. We sell beer and we do have a few cocktails and wine.

But it's a community gathering space and I hope we can continue to do that and thank you for your time.

[Speaker 1] (40:36 - 41:31)
Thank you, Mr. Gulley. Thank you for your investment in our city as well. With that, we're going to move on to the agenda starting at the top of page two with Mayoral Introduction Document Number 02023-0005763, co-sponsored by Alder People Nugent, Martin, Burnett, Ramirez, Rosa, and Lawson.

Amendment to the Municipal Code Section 17-5-0200 and 17-5-0207 regarding standards for rooftop and grade outdoor dining. All committee members should have received a copy electronically and will find the ordinance as well as a brief summary in their packet. We have with us the Zoning Administrator Patrick Murphy to walk us through the ordinance as well as Liquor Commissioner Shannon Trotter and the Assistant Director of Business Affairs Chris Jessop here to answer any questions.

Mr. Murphy.

[Speaker 6] (41:31 - 42:26)
Thank you, Vice Chairman. Patrick Murphy with the Department of Planning and Development. This ordinance is light necessarily on text.

Some of the things we brought here before are usually rather text heavy. This is a rather straightforward change to the use matrix in manufacturing zoning districts. It will allow, if it can be shown on screen it might be easier, but it will allow through either permitted or special use designation the establishment of at grade or rooftop outdoor areas, patio areas, not just for brewery uses but for any eating and drinking establishment in manufacturing districts.

As the Vice Chairman said, representatives from BACP are here. We can answer any questions you may have regarding the specific application of this ordinance change or any questions you may have about specific operations or licensing impacts. It's a rather straightforward text modification that applies in manufacturing districts to allow the outdoor activities.

[Speaker 1] (42:27 - 42:36)
Great. Thank you, Administrator Murphy. We have Alderman Rubens Rosa for purposes of quorum.

Any questions by committee members? I see Alderman Conway.

[Speaker 26] (42:37 - 42:52)
Yes. Thank you very much for the ordinance. Does the user have to have successfully participated in the dining program already or can they apply new now based on this?

[Speaker 6] (42:54 - 43:03)
Again, Patrick Murphy with the Department of Planning. I'll turn it to licensing, but this is open to any facility even if they are newly established the day after this ordinance were to pass. Great.

[Speaker 26] (43:03 - 43:04)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (43:06 - 43:07)
Shannon, do you want to answer that?

[Speaker 25] (43:12 - 43:32)
Shannon Trotter, Local Liquor Control Commissioner. Yes, Alderman Conway. So this would allow for any new applicants to apply for an outdoor patio license.

In the licensing process, zoning checks go first, so this would allow them to pass through zoning to make application for the outdoor patio license just as any other liquor license application proceeds.

[Speaker 16] (43:35 - 44:48)
Great. Thank you. Alderman Martin.

Thank you, Vice Chair. I want to start briefly by thanking DPD, CDOT, and the Mayor's Office for taking the lead on bringing this important ordinance to us as well as Alders, Burnett, Rosa, Lawson, and Nugent for championing this. I think one of the best ordinances that we've passed in this term was making permanent expanded outdoor dining.

One of the very few bright spots of the pandemic was the ability of restaurants and breweries and taverns to expand their footprint to provide safe and enjoyable spaces for people to eat, to drink, and just enjoy comfortably the company of their friends and loved ones. When we passed expanded outdoor dining and made that permanent, we weren't able to address the issue that's before the committee today. So I'm glad that we are turning to this before the end of the year.

It's going to provide sorely needed relief to many locally owned and operated businesses across Chicago, and I hope that we're able to get this done both today and tomorrow. Thank you. Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (44:48 - 44:48)
Alderwoman Nugent.

[Speaker 14] (44:52 - 46:18)
I want to thank Commissioner Meyer and his staff, in particular Chris Jessop and Shannon Trotter, as well as Alderman Matt Martin and the Mayor's Office for their work on this important amendment to the Zoning Code. When the COVID pandemic hit, we all worked to do the best we could and navigate that unknown together. And from that, some wonderful new ideas were born and programs were born, like expanded outdoor dining for our restaurants and breweries.

As things settled and we adjusted to a new normal, some of our programs were retired, and with that we had some unintended consequences. One of those unintended consequences was boxing out breweries and manufacturing districts from having outdoor patios. Many Chicago breweries are prime examples of creative and adaptive reuse of warehouses and buildings and manufacturing districts into things like tack brooms and microbreweries.

Today's ordinance will help correct the unintended consequence of excluding these breweries from outdoor dining. I'd especially like to thank Gary Gulley of Alarmist Brewing, who testified earlier today in the 39th Ward for his advocacy, support, and championship of this issue. Additionally, I'd also like to thank Janita Tucker from the Peterson-Pulaski Business and Industrial Corridor, who also testified today for sharing her strong support for this ordinance from the businesses and manufacturing community in the 39th Ward.

Again, thank you, Chairman, members of the committee, the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection, and the Mayor's Office and Alderman Martin for their efforts on this ordinance. I ask you all for your favorable consideration today. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (46:19 - 46:22)
Thank you, Alderman Nugent. Alderman Ramirez-Rosa.

[Speaker 9] (46:23 - 46:59)
Thank you so much. I, too, want to speak highly of this ordinance. I'm so happy to co-sponsor this alongside so many of our wonderful colleagues and the Mayor.

I also want to thank Sam Toy of the Restaurant Association and have that be reflected on the record because he has been advocating for quite some time as well to ensure that we are expanding outdoor dining and that we are helping our small businesses cut through red tape and thrive. So I'm so excited, and I look forward to the breweries in the 35th Ward taking advantage of this opportunity to provide more outdoor seating and more fun and safe revelry during the warmer months. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (47:00 - 47:11)
Great. Any other questions by committee members? If there are none, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Alderman Hopkins.

[Speaker 19] (47:12 - 48:05)
Yeah, thank you, Chairman. Not a question, just to point out a little history here. Since brew pubs seem to be driving the need for this change, of course, any restaurant could take advantage of it.

But, you know, the idea that enjoying a craft beer should take place in an industrial setting actually started 35 years ago in what is now the 2nd Ward when Goose Island brew pub was first formed. So the craft brewing industry in industrial and manufacturing districts in Chicago have kind of grown up together over these many years. And it's just gratifying to see that it's still very much a part of our history.

You know, it's something that we should all be proud of in Chicago, and I'm pleased to support this amendment. It's necessary. The industry continues to thrive, but they do need our help post-COVID, and this is a good means to provide them with assistance for continued growth.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Alderman Hopkins. I'm sorry.

Anyone else?

[Speaker 1] (48:06 - 48:56)
Remember to go to both sides of the room. All right. Hearing none, do I have a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

All the person Fuentes moves do pass. Any objections? Hearing none, this ordinance is passed.

Congratulations. Next up mayoral introduction document number 2023-0005759, co-sponsored by Alders, La Spada, Ramirez-Rosa, and Lawson. Amendment to municipal code by adding section 17-13-0303-D, optional administrative adjustment and variation to applications.

All committee members should have received a copy electronically and will find the ordinance as well as a brief summary in the packet before them. Once again, we have the zoning administrator, Patrick Murphy, here to give us a presentation on the ordinance. Mr. Murphy.

[Speaker 6] (48:57 - 49:59)
Thank you, Vice Chairman. Patrick Murphy with the Department of Planning. This text amendment seeks to add in an optional scenario whereby type one zoning map amendments can include, subject to council approval, variations and administrative adjustments, which currently require applicants to proceed either through an internal process for an administrative adjustment through the Department of Planning or through a hearing through the Zoning Board of Appeals for variations. The goal of this text amendment would be to provide a faster means for applicants to get from zoning approval to the ability to seek a permit, but it would be optional at the discretion of council on individual cases. So if city council so chose to pass this legislation, but not reference a variation or administrative adjustment in a future ordinance, then applicants presuming their zoning map amendment is approved would still proceed through the process they have today, which is to seek an administrative adjustment or a variation depending on the relief requested.

That's all. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (50:00 - 50:03)
Thank you. Questions by committee members? Alderman LaSpada.

[Speaker 11] (50:04 - 51:15)
Perhaps more of a comment if you'll allow. So I really love what we're bringing forward today and I'll give credit a couple different places. Number one to collaborator, frequent collaborator from across the aisle, Liz Butler, who came to us originally only around transit-served locations.

And so isn't it an odd thing that 75% of what you want to get done with the development can happen here at the Zoning Committee, but then you go all the way over to a parallel process with the Zoning Board of Appeals for things such as the parking elimination. Came forward with a draft and then to borrow a meme that feels topical for the day, Zoning Administrator Patrick Murphy said, hold my beer. And he came up with a concept that was even more elegant and comprehensive than originally proposed.

It's fantastic. This is really what it looks like when a city that works, works smarter rather than just harder, that proves out that equitable development can be efficient development at the same time. And I'm really glad for so many hands that are bringing this forward for the city today.

Thank you, sir.

[Speaker 1] (51:16 - 51:20)
Thank you, Alderman LaSpada. Any other members? Alderman Ramirez-Rosa.

[Speaker 9] (51:21 - 51:52)
As we know too often, time is money. And oftentimes it takes too long for developers to get the clearances that they need to begin investing and building in our neighborhoods. So I'm really thankful to Patrick Murphy, to the mayor's office for bringing this forward.

I'm that this is something that will streamline processes that I hope that we can continue to work in this vein to pass similar ordinances. So kudos to our Zoning Administrator and to Alderman LaSpada and to the mayor and to you, Alderman Lawson.

[Speaker 1] (51:53 - 52:33)
Thank you, Alderman Ramirez-Rosa. Anyone else on this item? I will just echo that I think this is really smart and something that we should continue to do to cut red tape for development and small businesses.

And I applaud my co-sponsors, the mayor's office and the team from DPD and Patrick for their work on this. And I look forward to doing more in 2024. A rhyme almost as bad as your pun, Alderman LaSpada.

It's the end of the year. We're going to be nice, right? All right.

No more questions by committee members. Motion do pass by the same roll call. I have a question.

Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about that.

I can't see you.

[Speaker 12] (52:34 - 53:17)
And this is for Patrick. Patrick, what impact does this have on our ability to really look at the design that would be presented by a developer? When we're talking about setback eliminations and height, the administrative adjustments related to parking setbacks, height.

My question is clear. I just want to make sure we're not losing oversight over some design concerns that we have.

[Speaker 6] (53:19 - 54:18)
Thank you, Alderman. Patrick Murphy, again with the department of planning. This changes nothing about these applications or the detail that's provided or the extent that they're reviewed in your committees, in the communities or here in city council.

All of the information that is related to any administrative adjustment or variation that is considered prior to this text change would have to have been disclosed to city council as a part of their application anyway. The only thing that's changing is the means by which it gets approved. If this legislation is approved and if council chooses to act on an administrative adjustment or variation that is part of a future application, then it can be all approved here in committee on zoning.

The only thing it will do is save time for an applicant if the committee chooses to take on those additional elements. It doesn't change anything about the design reviews, parking evaluations, the merits of the project itself in your communities. None of that is affected by this.

[Speaker 12] (54:19 - 54:23)
Thank you for that. Thank you, Mr. Chair.

[Speaker 1] (54:24 - 55:03)
Thank you Alderman Dowd. I apologize. Anyone else on line with questions?

I don't see any hands or in the chamber. All right, seeing none, all the minutes bottom moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, the ordinance is passed. Moving on, we have document number 02023-0005896, the historical landmark designation of 2678 West Washington Boulevard located in the 27th Ward. We have Candalyn Hahn of the Historic Preservation Division of the Department of Planning and Development here to present.

Candalyn?

[Speaker 3] (55:04 - 1:02:21)
Thank you, Chairman Lawson. Again, Candalyn Hahn, Department of Planning and Development. So on October 5th, the Commission on Chicago Landmarks found that 2678 West Washington Boulevard meets three landmark criteria and voted to recommend its designation as a Chicago landmark to the City Council.

Originally built circa 1880 as a frame, single-family residence for merchant John Howard, subsequent remodelings by Howard and its next owner, tire magnate Fred W. Morgan, transformed it into the fine example of a large masonry Queen Anne-style residence we see today. The site's located in the East Garfield Park community area in the 27th Ward.

It sits mid-block between California and Talmon and extends from Washington to the next street, North Maypool. On the site map at right, the home is shown in yellow. A dormitory attached to the home is shown in purple.

Inspired by period styles which dominated domestic architecture between the two World Wars, the dormitory was designed and built by the noted Chicago architecture firm of Holabird and Roche in 1923. William Holabird and Martin Roche are recognized for their innovative contributions to the Chicago School of Architecture and their partnership was one of the most successful and prolific in Chicago both before and after the turn of the 20th century. Around the time the dormitory was built, the firm was responsible for five to ten percent of the construction in the city and over a dozen of the Holabird and Roche's buildings are designated as individual Chicago landmarks including the building we're sitting in right now.

Both the home and dormitory are also rich in the history of institutions that cared for Chicago's women and children in need. The Chicago Home for Convalescent Women and Children purchased the property in 1923 with plans to build the dormitory with wards specifically for children as the demand for its services had outgrown their existing facilities on Adams Street. This charitable organization began in 1902 and was called a among the city's charitable institutions.

Indeed it was the only institution of its kind in Chicago when it was founded by city missionary Annie Hibbert to provide refuge for underprivileged women discharged from hospitals but too ill to return home and to try to find unemployment for them before leaving. It welcomed the diverse population of Chicago and their facilities were open to anyone irrespective of religion or nationality. Within a decade the organization expanded its mission to care for children and by 1919 it had to work with the Chicago Public Schools to set up an academic program at the home.

These education services continued at 2678 West Washington as shown in the image at right. Women were at the heart and head of the organization from its beginning. It was founded, run, and supported by women.

They staffed the home. Others paid a subscription to support the charity's work and volunteered their time. Fundraising events for the charity were covered in the Women's Society pages of Chicago newspapers.

By 1946, after helping what some estimated as much as 15,000 of Chicago's women and children, the charity was forced to close its doors due to shortage of hospital staff and the property was donated to the Chicago Community Trust. The trust determined that an organization called the Florence Crittenton Anchorage had the mission most similar to that of the convalescent home and offered use of the home to the organization in 1949. The Florence Crittenton Anchorage had been founded in 1886 when it opened a mission, also known as an Anchorage, for sex workers and those at risk for becoming one, such as unmarried pregnant women and widowed or abandoned women with children.

In 1893, the local charity became associated with the National Florence Crittenton Mission Network of Women's Shelters when it provided funding to the struggling Anchorage in Chicago. The national organization, named in honor of the original funder's late daughter, Florence Crittenton, had been founded in 1883 to provide a home and education to girls and women being exploited for sex, escaping violent relationships, or trying to survive alone or as single mothers. Centered mainly in large cities, these shelters evolved over time to become maternity homes for unwed mothers.

Chicago's Anchorage was a beacon for women across the city, one of the few charitable health care facilities that served any woman in need, regardless of nationality, race, or religion. Also unusual for the time, there was no segregation and all residents lived together. Services offered by the Florence Crittenton Anchorage of Chicago evolved over the years.

In its early years, the home sheltered not only homeless and destitute women, but also the young children, including those born to unmarried pregnant residents. One of the Anchorage's goals was to help mothers establish and maintain close ties with their children, and in the face of social censure of unmarried mothers, the Anchorage advocated the practice of unwed mothers maintaining custody of their children. The Anchorage's move to 2678 West Washington allowed the home to reopen in 1949.

The main house was used for living rooms, a dining room, kitchen, offices, staff quarters, and the dormitory was set up with 11 sleeping rooms, which accommodated 30 residents and two nurseries. The Anchorage strove to meet the social, physical, and emotional needs of its residents during their stay by providing enclosed yards for residents to go outdoors, appropriate nutrition, 24-hour nursing services, and connections to outside social service agencies if they did not already have one. Throughout its existence, women volunteers were the backbone of the Anchorage as well, from organization and setup to fundraising.

They also staffed the facilities, nurses, directors, and social workers. As the Anchorage's clients became younger and more middle class, the Anchorage's emphasis shifted to providing a temporary refuge. For the last months of a schoolgirl's or single young working woman's pregnancy, programs evolved to target their needs and volunteers might teach sewing or hairstyling to aid in future employment opportunities.

Meanwhile, the home was remodeled for new uses, such as the recreation room with TV shown at center. In the 1960s, the Anchorage began restricting admittance to women 18 years or older because of strict state license requirements. The restriction contributed to declining enrollment and subsequent financial problems, and the home closed in 1973.

The property was next acquired by Volunteers of America, a national nonprofit social service organization that used the property to house the Living Center for Girls, a program for abused and neglected teenage women and girls between 1977 and 1988. The residential facility at 2678 West Washington provided social work, psychological, and child care services, and the top floor of the main house was used for the Volunteers of America's chapter offices. The property's last institutional tenant was Intervoice, Inc., a not-for-profit entity formed in 1984 as a soup kitchen on the west side of Chicago. Between 1998 and 2015, Intervoice operated a family shelter at 2678 West Washington Boulevard. To honor that work, a donated sculpture entitled Passage was installed at 2678 West Washington in 2011. Images of Martin Luther King Jr.'s Civil Rights March on the west side reference Chicago's open housing movement, and the piece was meant to honor the work done in Chicago to end homelessness. After returning to private ownership, the home was recently sold, and the new owners support the landmark designation. Alderman Walter Burnett has been briefed on the proposed designation and has suggested he support it. He's here today to speak if he should care to do that.

Please let know if you have any questions, and thank you very much for your time.

[Speaker 1] (1:02:23 - 1:02:31)
Thank you, Ms. Hahn. Alderman Burnett had to run to a ribbon-cutting, but I know we spoke and he indicated his support. Do we have any questions or comments from committee members?

[Speaker 12] (1:02:33 - 1:02:34)
Mr. Chairman, I have a comment.

[Speaker 1] (1:02:35 - 1:02:35)
Thank you.

[Speaker 12] (1:02:36 - 1:03:28)
You know, I used to work in this building when Volunteers of America, I was a staffer of the Volunteers of America, and I went to this building every day. I just want to commend Alderman Burnett for landmarking this gorgeous building, the interior. I haven't been in in years, but I can remember the wood, the charm that's there, the sliding doors.

This is a wonderful landmark, and I want to thank the Landmarks Commission for not overlooking this building. It sits by itself on Washington alone, and I'm glad to see that we're moving forward with this landmarks. Congratulations to Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 1] (1:03:30 - 1:03:58)
Right. Thank you, Alderman Dowell. Maybe if you can produce a photo of your time there, Ms. Hahn can arrange a tour and put it into the record, right?

That's what we all want to see. Great. Any other questions by committee members?

All right. Hearing none, Alderman Beal moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to the determined quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, this designation is passed.

[Speaker 3] (1:03:58 - 1:03:59)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:00 - 1:04:36)
We will now move on to the map amendments. In an effort to ensure the committee meeting runs as smoothly as possible, items are grouped together according to witness and will be heard in that order rather than word order. Oh, great.

First up, item number A8851 in the 35th Ward. Ordinance referred 9-14-23. Common address is 3863-3909 North Drake Avenue.

Change request, B22, Neighborhood Mixed Use District to RS3, Residential Single Unit Detached House District. We have Alderman Ramirez-Rosa.

[Speaker 9] (1:04:37 - 1:05:38)
Thank you so much. This is a routine rezoning as required per our city code. Our city code states that when a type 1 zoning map amendment is not acted upon within two years, that we will revert back to the original zoning.

So in this case, this parcel is in Irving Park. We had a community-driven zoning process with a developer who proposed a multi-unit townhouse development with some affordability. It was well received by the community.

I supported it. It went through this committee more than two years ago. The developer had all of the authorization that he needed to move forward, but he never built permits.

And more than two years have gone by, and he has informed our office that he's not going to move forward with this development. Therefore, per our city code, we are reverting this parcel back to its zoning prior to the type 1 zoning map amendment. And of course, we worked with our zoning administrator to prepare this ordinance.

[Speaker 1] (1:05:39 - 1:06:19)
Great. Thank you, Alderman. Any questions by committee members?

Hearing none, Alderwoman Ramirez makes a motion to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Top of page three, item number 22301, 13th Ward, referred 11-15-23. Common address is 5710-5718 South Central Avenue. Change request, B3-1 Community Shopping District and RS-2 Residential Single Unit Detached House District to B3-1 Community Shopping District.

We have Attorney Tyler Manick.

[Speaker 18] (1:06:20 - 1:07:17)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Tyler Manick, Ashame Banks, Kenyon-Schwartz. I'm here on behalf of the applicant for Flow Transportation, Inc., which owns a subject property of 5710-5718 South Central. The northern half of this property is improved with a single-story, 4,500-square-foot office building in zone B3-1, whereas the southern half is vacant and unimproved, but also zoned RS-2. The applicant seeks to rezone the unimproved portion of this lot to B3-1, eliminate the split zoning, in order to add accessory parking to serve the office space. The applicant has worked closely with Alderman Quinn, who has given this committee a letter of no objection.

As such, I respectfully request this committee's favorable support to rezone 5710-5718 South Central to a uniformed B3-1 zoning district, and I'd be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (1:07:18 - 1:08:09)
Thank you, Mr. Manick. We do have the support letter from Alderman Quinn. Any questions by committee members?

Seeing none, Alderman Person Fuentes moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Next up is item number 22302 in the 37th Ward. Ordinance referred 11-15-23.

Common address is 5034-50548 West Chicago Avenue. Change request. RS-3, residential single unit detached house district, and B3-1 community shopping district to B3-3 community shopping district.

Front and center, we have Attorney Peter Zagata. You may proceed when you're ready.

[Speaker 22] (1:08:15 - 1:08:53)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yes, sir. My name is Peter Zagata, attorney for the Applicant Stone Community Development Corporation.

We are requesting a rezoning from the B3-1 RS-3 to a B3-3, the community shopping district, in order to build a multi-use three-story building that will serve as a medical clinic, mixed-use cafe, and a community, pardon me, community meeting center in conjunction with Lower East Children's Hospital, who will be one of the tenants in the building.

[Speaker 1] (1:08:55 - 1:09:40)
Great. Thank you so much. I know we have a letter of support from Alderman Mitts.

She was going to join, but I don't see her on the Zoom, unless she's there hiding. No? Any questions by committee members?

Hearing none, Alderman Hopkins moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, this item is passed.

Thank you. Thank you for your time. All right, the bottom of page three, item number A8833 in the ninth ward, ordinance referred 52423, common address is 319 East 103rd Street.

The change request is B3-1 community shopping district to RS-2 residential single unit detached house district. We have Alderman Anthony Beal.

[Speaker 8] (1:09:42 - 1:10:07)
Mr. Chairman, it is so good to finally have this heard before committee. It's been sitting in committee since May, and this is a zoning change that was put in for future land plan usage. It's a simple automatic zoning change that is routine, and I'm just glad to finally be here to get past the finish line.

So, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I would like the favorable support of this committee.

[Speaker 1] (1:10:08 - 1:10:12)
Great. Any questions by committee members? Alderman Espada.

[Speaker 11] (1:10:13 - 1:10:25)
To add up real quick, so I just wanted to, I was curious because when I pulled it up online, it looks like it's an existing beauty supply shop. Can you talk to us about the RS-3 zoning?

[Speaker 8] (1:10:26 - 1:10:30)
It's a beauty supply shop. There's nothing there. It's empty.

[Speaker 11] (1:10:31 - 1:10:35)
So why, just so I understand, why RS-2?

[Speaker 8] (1:10:37 - 1:10:39)
Future land plan usage.

[Speaker 11] (1:10:41 - 1:10:43)
That's an interesting, okay. Thank you. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:10:44 - 1:12:46)
Thank you. Any other questions? If none, Alderman Moore moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

With Alderman Espada recorded as voting no. Any others wish to be recorded as voting no or objecting? Hearing none, this item is passed.

Thank you. All right, next up, we are going to hear the next three items together in the 24th Ward. They are item number A, 8844, the 24th Ward, ordinance referred, 9-14-23, common address 3513 to 3527 West Grenshaw Street, 1134 to 1142 South St. Louis Avenue. The change request, residential plan development number 793 to RT-4, residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district. I'm going to read all three in, so bear with me. Number two is item number A, 8845 in the 24th Ward, ordinance referred, 9-14-23, common address 3512 to 3526 West Roosevelt Road, 1154 South St. Louis Avenue. Change request, residential plan development number 793 to B-3-3, community shopping district. And number A, 8846 in the 24th Ward, ordinance referred, 9-14-23, common address is 3440 to 3456 West Roosevelt Road, 1133 South St. Louis Avenue, 3443 to 3445 West Grenshaw. Change request, residential plan development number 793 to residential plan development number 793 as amended.

File number A, 8846 was heard and passed by the Chicago Plan Commission. I have a motion to incorporate all records and findings from that hearing by the same roll call vote that was used to determine quorum. All in the spot of so moves, the records are incorporated.

We have Alderwoman Monique Scott here to present on this matter.

[Speaker 24] (1:12:47 - 1:13:11)
So this, the zoning was changed due to, it was an NOF grant for a sit-down fine dining restaurant. And it was originally planned years ago for high-rise buildings. So this is now to get the restaurant started and get the zoning changed so that we can start to build.

[Speaker 1] (1:13:12 - 1:13:18)
Great. Thank you, Alderwoman. Noah Sofronik from Planning, did you want to add?

[Speaker 23] (1:13:19 - 1:13:48)
If you need more detail, it's just, this was a plan development from like 25 years ago. Originally it was two buildings, east of St. Louis was built, west of St. Louis was never acted upon. This would revise the PD to just incorporate the built project and reset the zoning for the two parcels that are west of St. Louis. Facing onto Roosevelt would be back to the B zoning that's on the list there. And then the stuff that faces Grenshaw would go back to the RT-40 originally west. So it's resetting an undeveloped parcel.

[Speaker 1] (1:13:48 - 1:15:17)
Great. Thank you. Any questions by committee members?

Seeing none, Alderman Knudson moves do pass by the same motion that was used to determine quorum. Actually, hold on a second. Alderman Knudson moves do pass files A8844, A8845, and A8846 with A8846 passing as revised by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, these items are passed. Thank you, Alderman Scott.

Okay. All right. So item number 21-075 in the first ward, which has now moved to the 26th ward, ordinance referred 622-22.

Common address is 1429 North Fairfield Avenue. The change request, RS3 residential single unit detached house district to RM4.5 residential multi-unit district. We have Attorney Rolando Acosta.

Alderperson Fuentes moves to amend the application to a type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is amended to a type one application.

Mr. Acosta.

[Speaker 21] (1:15:17 - 1:15:57)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant. The proposal before you involves a standard Chicago lot that is improved with a three flat containing three units, two parking spaces.

It has an empty basement. The applicant wishes to construct a unit in the basement so that it'd be four units on site. They will add one parking space to the property.

So the total will be four units, three parking spaces. We went through a community process when it was in the first ward with Alderman La Spada, and since it's moved to the 26th ward, have been in contact with Alderperson Fuentes, who is also supportive of this matter. I'm happy to answer any questions the committee may have.

[Speaker 1] (1:15:58 - 1:16:00)
All right, well, I will start with Alderperson Fuentes.

[Speaker 27] (1:16:01 - 1:16:13)
Yeah, we want to respect any projects that went through community processes in the first ward and received approval prior to the remap. And since this received approval from the first ward and the Alderman, we will accept the zoning change.

[Speaker 1] (1:16:13 - 1:16:15)
Great, thank you. Alderman La Spada?

[Speaker 11] (1:16:16 - 1:16:31)
I might only add it falls in line with a lot of really great 26th ward zoning changes in the proud 2023 tradition of zoning changes to allow ADUs. So loving it, loving it. Thank you, Chair.

[Speaker 1] (1:16:31 - 1:16:47)
Thank you. Any other questions by committee members? Hearing none, Alderman Hopkins, moves do pass.

Any objections? Hearing none, this item is passed as amended to a type one.

[Speaker 21] (1:16:47 - 1:16:48)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:16:48 - 1:17:36)
Thank you. All right. Coverage five.

Item number 22251-T1 in the 10th ward. Ordinance referred 9-14-23. Common address is 10-301 to 10-347 South Torrance Avenue.

Change requests. C-21, Motor Vehicle Related District to C-22, Motor Vehicle Related Commercial District. We have Tawil.

Yes. But before that, Alderman La Spada moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, the substitute narrative and plans are accepted. Mr. Tawil. Thank you.

[Speaker 20] (1:17:37 - 1:18:22)
Well, basically, this was a type one zoning change was done almost two years ago. We're changing the plan by adding a shopping center and a small oil change and tire change for trucks and cars and a fueling, diesel fueling station with the building and the shopping center is about five retail stores. And basically, that's all what we're doing.

If you have any questions. It's part of a bigger development. There's also north of 110th Street, there's another retail and a grocery store.

So this is part of it. That's phase one so far.

[Speaker 1] (1:18:22 - 1:19:54)
Great. Great. Thank you.

We do have a support from Alderman Chico. Any questions from committee members? Hearing none, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

Alderman La Spada moves do pass. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed with the substitute narrative and plans accepted.

Thank you. Thank you. All right, next two items on page five were deferred.

So we go to the last item on page six, item number 20686-T1 in the 36th Ward. Ordinance referred 42121. Common address 812 to 814 West Grand Avenue.

Change request is a B12 neighborhood shopping district to B12 neighborhood shopping district. We have Attorney Mark Kupiak and two motions. We have a substitute.

Alderperson Fuentes moves to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the substitute is before us.

Alderman Hopkins moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Actually, not Alderman Hopkins.

Alderman Knutson moves substitute narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the substitute narrative and plans are accepted.

Mr. Kupiak.

[Speaker 5] (1:19:54 - 1:20:18)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My name is Mark Kupiak. I'm an attorney, 77 West Washington, represent the applicant.

And just to clarify the two motions, that first motion was for our substitute ordinance, correct? Correct. Okay, good, because we're actually asking to change it to a B1-3, and that is the substitute ordinance.

[Speaker 28] (1:20:21 - 1:20:21)
We did.

[Speaker 5] (1:20:21 - 1:23:27)
Okay, good. Thank you very much. A little bit of a history with this project.

Sometime prior to 2019, another developer, different developer, had rezoned this property initially, rezoned it to a B1-2 in order to build a four-story mixed-use building. However, that developer never built the building. So they laid there vacant for some time until the current owner bought it.

The principal for the applicant is a neighborhood gentleman, Cheo Longobardo. Cheo lives in a neighborhood just north of the subject property. Cheo also owns a restaurant in the neighborhood, Piccolo Sono over at Halsted and Grand, very popular neighborhood restaurant.

Okay, good. So Cheo bought this property, wanted to build a similar four-story mixed-use building on the property. However, the initial zoning change was done as a type one, and because of the passage of time, no permit was pulled during two years after the initial passage.

So when Cheo came from his project, more than two years have passed, so he had to rezone it. Initially, the developer had gone before the Grand Central Neighborhood Association for his review, and they supported the initial zoning change. That particular neighborhood group had done an extensive planning project for that stretch of Grand Avenue for their preference for commercial on the ground floor and three floors of residential above, which is what the original building followed.

The plans before you, similar building, four stories, commercial on the ground floor and residential above. We went back to Chicago Grand Neighbors for another review, and they had a couple of smaller suggestions tinkering a little bit with the commercial on the ground floor, but one change that they recommended was on the front facade, our new architect had designed some balconies. They thought it looked better to get rid of the balconies, fill it in with actual enclosed living space, which increased our floor area.

Our problem was originally we were trying to stick with the B1-2, but the changes they recommended require a little more floor area because we've got a short substandard lot. So since we were doing a Type 1 anyway, they said go to a B1-3, and of course, the plans would be there with the Type 1 application. So that explains why we have to substitute, why we're asking for the B1-3.

And Chicago Grand Neighbors, led by Peter Frisby, had given Alderman Villegas a letter of support back when we met with him, and just recently he updated his letter of support, which was forwarded to the Alderman. So with that said, mixed-use building, commercial on the ground floor, residential above, four units, and we would ask for your support.

[Speaker 1] (1:23:27 - 1:23:40)
Great. Thank you. We do have the support from Alderman Villegas.

Do I have any questions by committee members? No. You have a restaurant owner with a commercial space.

Is there a restaurant planned for that first floor?

[Speaker 5] (1:23:40 - 1:23:58)
Not a restaurant. He was thinking, and of course, you can see by the days we've been after this for a while, his thought at the time, rather than a restaurant, because he's got a beautiful restaurant in the neighborhood, might do a coffee shop with pastries or something, something on a little smaller scale, given the site.

[Speaker 1] (1:23:59 - 1:24:21)
Right. Well, it's certainly a great brand, and we wish him success. Any other questions by committee members?

Hearing none, Alderman Conway makes a motion, do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed with a substitute ordinance and with a substitute narrative and plans.

Thank you.

[Speaker 5] (1:24:21 - 1:24:22)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:24:24 - 1:24:36)
That's it. Hearing there's no other business before the body, Alderman Beal moves to adjourn. All in favor, say aye.

Any opposed? We are adjourned. We'll see you tomorrow.

[Speaker 28] (1:25:11 - 1:25:12)
Thank you.
