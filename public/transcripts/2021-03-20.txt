[Speaker 16] (1:31 - 1:34)
Good morning, Chairman, or afternoon, Chairman, excuse me.

[Speaker 11] (1:37 - 1:38)
Good afternoon, Chairman.

[Speaker 2] (2:49 - 6:12)
Good afternoon, colleagues. So we're waiting for a few more of our committee members, and then we will start the subject matter hearing. All right.

The May 20th, 2021 subject matter hearing for the Committee on Zoning Landmarks and Building Standards is called to order. Pursuant to applicable law, the chairman has determined that an in-person meeting is not practical or prudent. Accordingly, attendance at this meeting will be by remote means only.

And I hope that can end in a few weeks myself. We'll start with it. We'll start off with the roll call of committee members.

Please unmute yourself. Let me see. Vice Chair Roboyas.

Present. Present. Vice Chair Roboyas.

Yes, sir. I'm present. Thank you.

Alderman Hopkins. Present, Mr. Chairman. Alderman Dowell.

[Speaker 21] (6:12 - 6:13)
Here, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 2] (6:14 - 6:25)
Alderman Sawyer. Alderman Beal. Alderman Raymond Lopez.

[Speaker 16] (6:27 - 6:28)
Originally present.

[Speaker 2] (6:30 - 8:40)
Alderman David Moore. Alderman Mike Rodriguez. Alderman Siccio Lopez.

Alderman Burnett. I think he's still a planning commissioner. Alderman Cardona.

Present, Chairman. Alderman Waguespack. Alderman Austin.

Alderman Villegas. Alderman Riley. Present.

Alderman Kappelman. Alderman Osterman. And last but not least, Alderman Marie Haddon.

Present. Thank you. And then, of course, I'm here.

Subject matter hearings do not require a roll call or a majority of members present. What we're going to discuss at the subject matter hearing is to discuss the findings from the Department of Buildings pilot program, which are allowed for use of nationally accepted drain, waste and vent pipe materials in residential and commercial buildings to reduce the cost of construction and provide equitable benefits for neighborhood investment. There will be no vote taken today regarding the findings of today.

At this time, we will now begin the public comment period. Out of respect for everyone's time, each speaker is limited to three minutes. And I believe nine speakers signed up today.

And Alderman Kappelman is present. And then we have Alderman Kappelman joining us. We'll start with Chris Chedwick.

Let's start with Chris.

[Speaker 9] (8:49 - 11:50)
Thank you, Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Christopher Schwedek and I'm a licensed architect and building code consultant with Burnham Nationwide and director of the code group supervising third party plan reviews for the city's developer services program. Over the last 24 years, I've advised clients regarding Chicago codes.

And I also teach a course on building codes at Harbor college. In addition, I'm a member of the American Institute of architects, the building owners and managers association and the Illinois green alliance. Working on matters relating to updates of both the Illinois and the Chicago plumbing code.

I'm also involved in advancing the model codes as a member of the international code council. Currently serving on several committees. My purpose here today is to urge that the current pilot program for alternate approval of PVC and other plastic piping for drainage, vent pipe and pipe fittings be allowed as a right.

And be incorporated into the code as has for several years than the case where the Illinois plumbing code, as well as the international plumbing code, which by the way, served as the model for the rewritten Chicago plumbing code back in 2001. At that time, the rewrite. Of the rewrite scores of allegations regarding plastic pipe.

We're claiming that they were rupturing and causing property damage. That was 20 years ago. There are much better products available now, including low carbon PVC.

These new materials have the potential to outlast even copper lines and require less energy and fewer resources to manufacture. I'm sure you will hear ample testimony regarding the lower material costs along with lower installation costs of plastic pipe. The differential should be borne out by the very wise decision of the department of buildings to include on the ACAR alternative code approval request form.

A space to provide comparative costs between the proposed alternative materials versus the use of materials currently limited by the Chicago plumbing code. But another important factor to consider is the ACAR process itself, which includes $150 upfront filing fee paid separately to the department of revenue and a processing period of 10 business days with additional costs to the applicant. If using a licensed professional or expediter to process the form, which of course is in addition to the time and expense of obtaining the actual building permit to do the work.

This would normally not deter the average commercial applicant. But what about the average homeowner who is making necessary improvements to their house and then discovers one or more bureaucratic hurdles that they would not be encountering if they were installing plastic pipe in a nearby suburb. Frankly, three and a half years should be enough of a successful track record to validate the use of plastic pipe as is now allowed using the ACAR process.

Many hundreds of approved installations should speak for themselves. I highly recommend that the committee approved the formal addition of these materials into the plumbing code. Thank you.

[Speaker 2] (11:52 - 11:54)
Our next speaker, Mike Pfeiffer.

[Speaker 15] (12:06 - 14:03)
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon.

Thank you for the opportunity to make a very short statement. My name is Mike Pfeiffer and I'm the senior vice president of technical services at the international code council. My office is in country club Hills, Illinois just 30 miles Southwest from Chicago at 191st and Pulaski on behalf of the international code council.

I want to commend the mayor's office and the building's department for its drive to safely reduce the cost of construction and provide equitable benefits for enabling investment to the modernization of Chicago's building and safety codes. I'm happy to offer ICC's assistance as you proceed with your work. My staff and I just finished our committee action hearings for the 2024 edition of our high codes.

So I am very familiar with the amount of work that goes into reviewing, revising and updating building regulations. Our virtual code action committee hearings were an overwhelming success with 160% increase in participation from previous in-person cycles. The virtual platform works seamlessly and involves over 220 hours of hearings over 21 days.

I want to thank our members from Illinois who actively participated in the model codes maintenance and development process. ICC's robust infrastructure covers the whole code process, model code development to the jurisdictions administration and implementation of its adopted codes. Services include training, certification, evaluation services, accreditation, code interpretations, and so much more.

To serve the building community faster and better and to place these resources at your fingertips, we are actively transforming our ICC resources into digital products and solutions. In conclusion, we do indeed support the modernization of Chicago's codes and commit to you that the code council will continue to provide its services to your staff and the Chicago building community. Thank you for your time.

[Speaker 2] (14:05 - 14:07)
Thank you. Our next speaker is Paul Colgan.

[Speaker 12] (14:13 - 16:51)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. Thank you for this opportunity to speak with you today. I am Paul Colgan, government affairs director of the Home Builders Association of Greater Chicago.

We represent designers, builders, developers, remodelers, contractors, subcontractors, and material suppliers in the residential construction industry of Chicago. I want to start by thanking this committee, the city council and the department of buildings for your successful efforts in recent years to update modernize the Chicago building code. That is a very significant accomplishment for the city of Chicago.

If we don't have a modern affordable building code, we cannot have a safe and affordable Chicago. The alternative plumbing materials pilot is another positive step to help us keep housing affordable in the city. The program has proven itself to save thousands of dollars in plumbing costs for new construction or remodeling of homes and small apartment buildings.

As you may know, the housing industry has been hit with substantial increases in material costs in recent months. The lumber costs alone have jumped more than 300% in the past year. The National Association of Home Builders estimates that an additional $119 a month in rent is needed just to recover the increased cost of lumber in new apartment buildings.

Meanwhile, housing providers are also getting hit with price increases in plumbing materials as much as 80 to a hundred percent over the past year. Copper especially has seen a significant increase with some analysts predicting it will continue to go higher. Having the option to choose the most cost effective and safe plumbing materials helps us to save money for the homeowners and renters who depend upon us for affordable, safe, and healthy housing.

Although these products are called alternative materials, in reality they are plumbing products that are commonly used outside the city of Chicago. Most importantly, they are allowed under widely accepted model codes, such as the Illinois Plumbing Code and the International Plumbing Code that were written to protect the health and safety of the nation's water supply. As a result, we support making the Alternative Plumbing Materials Program for single family homes and neighborhood scale residential development a permanent part of the city code.

This will be a small but very important step to bring Chicago's plumbing code into alignment with the rest of the country. Thank you for consideration and we look forward to working with you to make Chicago an affordable and safe community for all its residents.

[Speaker 2] (16:52 - 16:56)
Thank you. Thank you. Our next speaker, Heather Morrison.

[Speaker 8] (17:13 - 20:19)
Dear Chairman and committee members. My name is Heather Morrison. I'm founder of Map Strategies.

We are compliant partners for the real estate community here in Chicago. I'm here to support the Chicago plumbing code update. We ask for your support as we work with many developers and have observed the financial impact of the changes to the plumbing code.

The real cost of an action of not adopting this code change includes the following issues, namely cost savings. We have observed that developers can save up to 3.5% of any given project construction costs, which can translate into several hundred thousands of dollars. The Chicago plumbing code currently limits the use of PVC to residential buildings up to three stories or less.

Additionally, the use of PVC is limited to gravity drainage and venting only and shall not be allowed for drain waste or venting and other applications. This creates a large additional cost for projects as cast iron and other pipes are more expensive and difficult to work with. The Department of Buildings understands this and has been running the pilot program as mentioned, originally announced in October of 2017.

And that allows the use of PVC beyond what is permitted in the code. The three and a half years of this program, 2,500 projects have been submitted, saving developers of those projects over $30 million. The number of projects submitted makes it really clear that the use of PVC in developments is a major cost saving item for project owners.

This program not only helps larger developers and private projects, but also small contractors and private citizens alike. The PVC, the PBC, the Chicago plumbing code is 20 years old at this point. And the commitment was made to update this code five years ago as part of the phase three of the Chicago construction codes modernization program, along with the mechanical code.

The proposal would permit PVC being used in a wider range of projects, including projects up to five stories and occupancies other than just residential for drainage and vent piping. We have submitted hundreds of alternative code approval requests through this pilot program to allow our clients to utilize PVC and preparing and processing these requests, requests takes many man hours both within our office and within city hall. Additionally, the proposal would change the plumbing fish fixture requirements, bringing it more in line with the state requirements.

This reduction of the number of plumbing fixtures could allow for small scale dining or assembly projects to have more space and other applications. In addition, the new proposal will allow for gender neutral toilet rooms. We ask for your support as a private consultant that works with many developers, as we have observed the financial impact of these changes of the plumbing code is very real.

We have a position to the mayor that hundreds of signs.

[Speaker 2] (20:22 - 20:23)
Our next speaker, Romero.

[Speaker 14] (20:34 - 22:39)
Good afternoon. I'd like to thank the committee for the opportunity to comment. My name is Ramiro Mata.

I am the senior director of technical and regulatory affairs with the American society of plumbing engineers. I was also a member of the international plumbing code technical committee at the recently completed code hearings. ASPE was founded in 1964 and currently has over 6,000 members who are leaders in innovative plumbing design, effective materials and application of advanced techniques throughout the world.

We are based here in the Chicago area and have worked closely with our Chicago chapter and drafting this comment. ASPE is dedicated to the advancement of the science of plumbing engineering and the health welfare and safety of the public. We are speaking in support of the proposal to revise chapter 18, that's 29 at the Chicago plumbing code to allow alternative materials for drain waste and bend pipes as prescribed in the Chicago plumbing interim code.

Sections 18, 29, seven on two, that one, seven on two, that two, and seven on two, that three. Alternative materials have been shown to comply with the provisions of this chapter and at least equal in performance and safety compared to the current approved materials. It is for this reason, they are currently approved and referenced in the state of Illinois plumbing code, the international plumbing code and the uniform plumbing code.

According to the Chicago building department, the Chicago building pilot program, which allowed the use of alternative materials as resulted in $34 million in cost savings from 2,141 projects since December 23rd of 2020. If approved addition of alternative materials into the Chicago plumbing code will be a significant step in the city's effort to modernize its codes program, and we'll add more flexibility and options while providing more affordable solutions for construction projects of all sizes in Chicago. We therefore urge the committee to approve the addition of alternative materials to the Chicago plumbing code.

Thank you for your consideration and thank you again for the opportunity to provide input.

[Speaker 2] (22:40 - 23:01)
Our next speaker, Pat Cardone. Try it again. Pat Cardone.

[Speaker 21] (23:06 - 23:08)
Please press star six to unmute.

[Speaker 2] (23:15 - 23:24)
We'll move on and we'll see if we can get Pat before we conclude the public comment period. The next speaker Tramiel Williams.

[Speaker 8] (23:31 - 23:33)
Chairman, I don't see Tramiel Williams.

[Speaker 2] (23:34 - 23:39)
Okay. Next speaker Ephraim Martin.

[Speaker 10] (23:48 - 26:42)
To chairman, 20 and members of the city council committee and zoning landmarks and building. Good morning. Good afternoon.

This is Ephraim Martin, president of Martins International. And I'm very pleased to be back in Chicago, beating the drums on behalf of the Black Heroes Matter Coalition for Jean Baptiste Pointe du Table. First, I want to say thanks to the people of Chicago who last Sunday, watched the global broadcast of our 39th IRAMA, the International Rec and Rural Music Awards from Jamaica to the rural.

Some of you may have known that part of Martin's international objectives include bringing nations together through music and culture. In our worldwide broadcast on Sunday, the Sabah and Chicago were well highlighted to the world in music and spoken already during the broadcast. Today, I must say a very special thanks to Alderman Brookings and members of the transportation and waste committee who unanimously voted yes.

And Alderman Moore and Alderman King ordinance to rename the outer lakeshore drive as the Sabah drive recently. That historic move got the attention of the world and people are now thinking Chicago is ready to make a change and to set examples for others to follow. Mr. Chairman, we are at a crucial point. The current wrongs to the Sabah, Chicago's founding father by renaming the outer lakeshore drive as the Sabah drive. Next Wednesday, the full city council will vote to rename the outer lakeshore drive from 67th street in the South to Hollywood and the North as the Sabah drive. The Black Heroes Matter Coalition urge and plead to all council members to vote yes, to give the Sabah, Chicago's founding father is due respect after 242 years of establishing this great city.

This 2021 council members can create a genuine Chicago history that the world will remember when all council members vote yes, to start the road and to show the world Chicago is ready to lead the way to end systemic racism in Chicago and America. The Black Heroes Matter Coalition has grown to have faith in all of your members and trust that on May the 26th reason will be given for us to have faith in all your council members for the 2021 onward. We again salute the transportation and waste committee and that first step to give full respect to the founding father on Wednesday the 26th.

We call on all of you to be united and to do it together. Thanks to each and everyone. And we hope to see that big change next week, Wednesday.

Thank you all.

[Speaker 2] (26:43 - 27:42)
Thank you. And our final speaker is Georgiana Quipt. Georgiana Quipt.

All right. Response. I'll go back to Pat Cardone.

Nope. And then last call for Georgiana Quipt. All right.

So that will conclude the public comment period. We've been joined by other members. Ciccio Lopez, Olsterman, David Moore and Burnett.

Walter, does anybody else?

[Speaker 20] (27:43 - 27:44)
Burnett is here.

[Speaker 2] (27:45 - 27:53)
Yes, Walter. We got you. David Moore, your hand is still up.

Is that to be recognized or do you have an immediate question?

[Speaker 21] (27:56 - 27:59)
I'll take it down. That's all I needed to be recognized. Thank you, David.

[Speaker 2] (27:59 - 28:59)
Okay. All right. So now we're going to start the hearing with the presentation of the findings from the building department.

I know that there will be questions regarding the presentation. However, I'm going to ask that committee members hold off on questions until all the speakers today have made their presentations. That being said, we have the commissioner on buildings, department Matt Bode here, as well as managing deputy commissioner Grant Ulrich here to walk us through the findings.

And commissioner we'll start with you. And then I just FYI, after we're going to hear the building department presentation, we are going to hear from members of local one 30, the plumbers union. We move them into the general part of the meeting rather than, than be in the public comment period.

So with that being said, Matt, do you want to start? You want to unmute Matt?

[Speaker 1] (28:59 - 43:14)
Sorry. So good afternoon, chairman Tony, and honorable members of the committee also with this day is first deputy Marlene Hopkins. So we are very pleased to be here today to report out the success of our plumbing pilot program.

I think you'll be, you'll be happy to hear the results and hopefully it will move us forward. So about five years ago, the department of buildings committed to a plan to modernize our building codes and working in partnership with industry stakeholders, community stakeholders, and others, including the city council to comprehensively modernize the Chicago construction codes and put Chicago on track to more regularly update our codes consistent with national standards, best practices going forward. And I also want to add with an equity lens.

So we are looking to make sure that our codes are equitable as well. In 2017 and 2018, the council passed the historic updates, the electrical code and the elevator conveyance code, both help control construction costs while driving safety and sustainability. In 2019, the council passed the first comprehensive update to the core provisions of the building code in 70 years.

And we spent the last two years implementing that major change, which brings us to phase four, where we are now. We're committed to address the remaining topics, the plumbing code, the mechanical code and regulations as a special hazardous occupancy for fire. Next slide, please.

Grant. Throughout the code modernization projects, DOP is engaged with a broad range of stakeholders affected by the codes. We enforce yourselves, architects and builders, home builders, investors, organized labor, affordable housing advocates, preservationists, environmentalists, and small businesses.

We've worked to build consensus for major code changes. This is why in partnership with one 30 and others, the department launched its plumbing materials pilot program in 2017. The program was built around finding ways to remove barriers to equitable neighborhood development, remove barriers for homeowners, seeking to repair, reinvest and stay in their homes and explore whether it might be appropriate to more closely aligned with the Illinois plumbing code or all the model plumbing codes followed in our neighboring States.

One factor we studied certainly was costs, but the program also gathered industry opinion for each request, either a licensed plumber or a licensed architect or engineer needed to state that the proposed alternative materials would be equal to or better than the limited range of materials recognized in the Chicago plumbing code. As you can see from this chart, the Chicago plumbing code recognizes many fewer materials for drain waste and vent piping in a four-story residential building than either the Illinois plumbing code or the main model plumbing codes adopted the United States, the international plumbing code or the uniform plumbing code. And Chicago is also the last place to mandate that lead and oak can be used in joining cast iron pipings.

The pilot program we're reporting out today is limited to drain waste and vent portions of the plumbing system. In 2017 and 2018, we briefly studied recommending changes to water distribution piping, but with the broad consensus from our stakeholders, we did not pursue that. So again, this is drain waste and vent piping.

All the materials allowed under the plumbing pilot program must be materials allowed elsewhere in Illinois under the Illinois plumbing code. Again, the pilot program was designed to gather data on three topics, the use of alternative underground plumbing materials in small and midsize buildings, the use of alternative plumbing materials in midsize residential buildings and the use of alternative plumbing materials for non-residential use focus on rehabilitation work to start. And I just do want to mention that the photo in this is the Pullman community center.

And as a side note, I know we've all been charged with trying to reduce the violence in our communities. And one way to do that is to give our youth an alternative to just hanging out on the street. So even though this is a, you know, plumbing pilot program, this shows where the plumbing pilot program goes beyond just cost savings and goes beyond just the debate of a pipe.

This, you know, this community center is really going to be a game changer and could save a lot of, a lot of young people. So the tort, as we know construction activity in Chicago is not equitable, just equitably distributed. The community areas of greater downtown saw construction activity with a reported cost of more than 4 billion each.

Since the pilot program began while fire to your community saw much, much less DOB's effort to modernize construction codes is one part of the administration's commitment to drive more equitable neighborhood investment. So the good results of the pilot program during the three and a half years, we've been running the pilot program. We've approved more than 2,500 projects, allowing cost savings of more than $34.6 million. For some of the larger projects, the savings have been in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, but the program has also helped homeowners save hundreds of dollars on routine plumbing repairs. And also very importantly to stay in their homes, which is a goal I know of many of the community. We don't want people forced out.

We want people to be able to stay in their homes. And even if it's a hundred dollars or so that they're saving, that could be the tipping point between staying in their home and their communities that they have connections to, or having to uproot and move. In general, residential projects report greater savings than non-residential projects for all projects.

The reported savings averaged 42% compared to materials recognized by the plumbing code. And again, residential projects had a little bit higher 43% and non-residential 36%. We're pleased that the participation has been distributed throughout the city with requests and approval in all but three neighborhood communities.

While the initial launch users of the pilot program are more concentrated in the North and Northwest areas, DOB has made concerted efforts to work with DPD and community partners to encourage participation in under-invested areas and have done so with good results. And one thing I do stress whenever I speak of this is while pilot programs are good, I'm not a big fan of word of mouth programs because that in itself is an equity barrier. Those that know about it can take advantage of it.

Those that don't know about it are spending more money. So the total reported cost savings, um, for the pilot program, because of the concentration of work and size of projects in near West and North Lakefront communities, the aggregate cost savings in dollars are larger, but nowhere near as skewed as the overall value of permanent activity. And I do want to note, um, on that red slide, you saw the big bright red, dark red for the downtown areas.

And you'll see on this side, downtown is not making all this money. And investment is not going into downtown. It's being distributed throughout the neighborhoods.

And what we're very pleased about is the average reported percentage of cost savings in the South side communities areas are noticeably higher. You see those, uh, the brighter blue areas where savings are 50% or more, you see where the lighter blue is 45% or more. You see that this is really reaching the areas where we want it to reach.

And again, that's neighborhood investment. That's keeping people in their homes. It's really where this is making a difference is not the major developments.

It's the, it's our actual communities. This is where this is having a huge impact, not just a residential, but we'll see commercial as well. So some success stories for single family residents, the average savings again is 43% for new construction, 47% for rehabilitation work.

And again, that's rehabilitation work are people wanting to stay in their homes and their communities and being able to do that under this, this program, multiple family residents savings, which we desperately need in the city, especially affordable, um, multifamily housing allows for four stories and underground 40% savings for new construction, 43% for rehabilitation, 48% for plumbing repair success stories that you'll hear about later is the armor Institute adaptive reuse.

That's a huge affordable housing complex and also community centers and community working areas in that. So again, that is a mix of the residential and non-residential you'll see the, um, a safe Haven on Roosevelt Avenue, low income housing and disabled veterans, brand new housing. You'll see about the Pullman arts-based loss again, work, live, affordable housing there.

And this is not only new construction. These are, you'll see, you'll hear that, um, the projects that are involved in this used to be vacant lots. They used to be vacant buildings.

There are buildings that the original use is no longer viable in the, in the city and they become adaptive reuse. And again, you, you're going to hear about, um, it's not just about savings. This is about reinvestment as well, because some of them might, some of the money that, um, they saved on this, we'll go back into those projects.

It may be the difference between having, um, building 10 affordable units versus 12. It may be a, even a matter of whether the project is even economically viable, um, through this, through this program. So there is reinvestments into services.

There is reinvestment into additional housing. So success non-residential. Um, so non-residential uses that have participated in this program are restaurants and bars, um, struggling even before the pandemic and definitely after the pandemic medical dental offices and clinics.

Again, as we try to get healthcare out into the community and not having to come all downtown to Northwestern, uh, revitalizing grocery stores, you'll see where this, um, you know, where there was a food desert. This is what this pilot program has enabled a grocery store to open up maybe where it wouldn't have, or maybe, um, there was a difference with between, um, it being bigger and offering more services retail as well. Non-residential savings about 36% and success stories here.

The friends health clinic at 63rd and cottage, um, that was on a vacant lot, local Marshall, the local market grocery store in the South shore. We had a Dominic's that was closed down and was sitting there for forever. And under this pilot program, another grocer was able to move into there and solve a huge food desert problem in that community, um, local market and pause Chicago.

As well. So again, we're talking about fighting food deserts, COVID recovery, and also community centers, giving our, our youth and our seniors a safe place to be within their own communities. So pause was in, um, 2019, they had a medical clinic in the little village.

They needed to replace 20 year old cast iron drain pipes, which were failing under the auto under the animal containment areas. And this is an area where, you know, PVC is actually a better product than cast iron for this particular loot use. And that pilot program allowed them to save a $53,000, which was over a third of their overall project cost.

And also it's not on this slide, but two more commercial spaces on that same block also took advantage of the pilot program. So we're not just talking standalone, uh, buildings here. We can talk about, this can revive an entire quarter or save an entire quarter.

So this is, um, a very good, good program that we're very proud of. Next slide. Great.

And just again, I just like to end on this slide to show that this is, um, having an impact all throughout the city. And especially it's having a greater impact in the areas that we really need to reach investment. We need to have construction costs, um, affordable.

We need to be able to rebuild in those areas and invest in those areas. So, um, again, we're excited about the pilot program. We're happy to report it out to you today with the success stories that we have seen.

We've developed this with input from a wide range of partners and established a framework for us to move forward and remove a lot of equitable barriers that we have, uh, found throughout this, this pilot program. And with that, um, Mr. Chairman, that ends our presentation.

[Speaker 2] (43:15 - 43:22)
Right. And yourself and then Grant and Marlene available for questions as we get through the rest of the presentation, right?

[Speaker 1] (43:22 - 43:22)
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 2] (43:23 - 43:48)
Okay. Just, just before we move into the, uh, plumbing, uh, unions issue, when you talk about 40 to 48% of, uh, project costs that you're talking about specifically within the plumbing category, are you talking about the overall, I understand the drain pipe issue in Logan, but you're talking about 40 to 48% of the plumbing budget or the overall budget?

[Speaker 1] (43:48 - 43:52)
It is overall, but the majority of it is the savings for the plumbing.

[Speaker 2] (43:52 - 44:06)
Okay. All right. All right.

Next, uh, we've got speakers from local one 30, the plumbers union. We have president James, uh, Mr. Chairman. Yes.

Uh, Alderman Beal.

[Speaker 18] (44:07 - 44:10)
I just wanted to let you know that I am here for purpose of form.

[Speaker 2] (44:11 - 44:17)
Thank you, sir. And, uh, you missed the presentation about the Pullman center and use.

[Speaker 18] (44:17 - 45:16)
No, I saw it. I saw it. Mr. Chairman, I am at an event. If I can just briefly just comment on this. Go ahead. Briefly, Tony.

We saved about, about 68 to $70 million on the construction costs when it, as far as the Pullman community center is concerned. And so that was a huge savings for a non-for-profit, uh, to be able to meet the deadline and goals. But I do want to also caution, um, the building department that when you're using PVC, uh, and we have found this in other areas, in the walls, when you're doing residential and people drill into the walls to hang pictures, to hang things like that, you may run into a problem.

So we need to find a way to safeguard that PVC, um, you know, in non-for-profit projects. But when you drill into the walls, because you drill right into that PVC and you create a hole, that's going to create a bigger problem down the road. So I just wanted to say that for the record.

[Speaker 2] (45:17 - 45:39)
Thanks, Tony. Um, appreciate it. Now, um, our, uh, Jim Majerovitz and from local one 30.

Uh, let's see. We also have business representative, uh, Jones Richmond here and, um, Jim, would you like to start and, and, uh, present a point and counter.

[Speaker 3] (45:41 - 45:45)
Alderman, I'm going to turn it over to Jones Richmond right now. I'll talk after them.

[Speaker 2] (45:46 - 45:57)
Okay. Then we'll start with Jones Richmond. I see Byron, Byron Lopez is on Byron.

Is it just to be recorded as, uh, being in the meeting, sir, or not?

[Speaker 21] (45:57 - 45:59)
Yes. Yes. Chairman.

Yep. Thank you.

[Speaker 2] (45:59 - 46:02)
We gotcha. Okay. Jim or Byron.

I'm sorry.

[Speaker 13] (46:03 - 47:38)
Hey, good afternoon, everybody. My name is Jones Richmond. I'm a business representative for local one 30.

I've been a licensed plumber for 32 years. I also worked for the city of Chicago as a plumbing inspector for 12 years. I sit on a printed board.

I was raised in affordable housing. This is a passion for me. I have four points I want to make.

We encourage investment in the city effort to help expand accessibility of affordable housing. We can, we continue to protect the quality safety and reliability of Chicago plumbing system infrastructure. These protections are the most paramount concern.

Number two, Chicago large density populations require high quality reliable building material to ensure safe and reliable water delivery to our drainage system. Number three, the apprentice training program educate hundreds of Chicago to attain a plumbing license. Number four, the apprentice plumbing partnership with organizations, groups show as higher 360 city colleges of Chicago, high school group, pastor for as well as other church groups.

Like I said, I have a passion for affordable housing because I was raised in there. And we do agree about residential. I just have a concern about commercial.

Thank you for listening to me. Thank you.

[Speaker 2] (47:42 - 48:04)
Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Jones. And now, uh, Jim Majerwicz, uh, are you going to somebody else?

Are you ready to speak? And if so, can you, do you have, are you on video? Cause I didn't, we didn't have, uh, uh, Jones Richmond on video.

You have, Oh, here we go.

[Speaker 3] (48:05 - 53:17)
There you go. Okay. All right.

So my name is Jim Majerwicz. I'm the president of Plumbers Local 130. My career in plumbing dated back to 1978.

I'm a 62 year resident of the city of Chicago. I'm a 30 year member of the American Society of Plumbing Engineers. I've taught many continuing ed classes for the ASPE.

I'm a certified plumbing designer, ASPE, a certified glean plumbing designer, ASPE, city of Chicago licensed journeyman, state of Illinois licensed journeyman, state of Illinois certified plumbing inspector. I collaborate in writing written codes for domestic and globally around the world. Formerly a member of the Illinois plumbing code advisory council, the city of Chicago plumbing code is a living document.

It was adjusted back for rehab back in 1978 to handle the needs of people rehabbing old buildings. In 1990, we were there to collaborate with the putting in PVC and residential. In 1997 grease traps were removed for six or fewer units.

In 2001 major changes to the plumbing code, 2002 major changes to the plumbing code, 2003 major changes to the plumbing code. As you see, the code is a living document and updated periodically, continuously evolving. Licensed plumbers, contractors, and those of us in the industry are subject matter experts in the field and we have contributed to the modernization of the city of Chicago plumbing code since its inception in the 1800s.

We work as a team to ensure the safety of the citizens, workers and visitors of Chicago. Back to the 1800s we've been doing that. Currently the city of Chicago plumbing code allows for PVC to be used as an alternate building material and residential properties up to three stories in height.

And that's been in since 1990. Under the city pilot program, there is an allowance for the material to be used up to four stories for new construction work and existing buildings, no more than four stories. The use of PVC in commercial or mixed use properties where the experts in the industry recognize problem with the use of the alternate materials in question.

The smoke developed ratings for PVC are extremely high, 975 and it shouldn't exceed the threshold of 50. Smoke developed ratings is measured of the concentration of smoke a material emits as it burns. Smoke generated by PVC is generally 2000 times higher than the industry recognized standards.

The burn of PVC can be toxic for residents and firefighters. The experts in the industry recommend the use of cast iron through the first floor of any commercial or mixed use property. Plastic pipe is not, not allowed anywhere in plenum ceilings.

PVC as with other building materials does not have its place today in today's environment. PVC does not belong in commercial and mixed use properties. Occupancy changes in mixed use or commercial building is another issue with using PVC as an alternate building material.

Occupants of commercial space spaces frequently changes. What was once a mixed use building, office building could become a commercial kitchen. An example of this, the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada, November 21st, 1980.

The fire killed 85 people from toxic smoke. These types of changes that can jeopardize safety. PVC does not belong in commercial or mixed use property.

Thank you, chairman.

[Speaker 2] (53:21 - 53:34)
Thank you. Thank you, Jim. And I can attest, I think the fact that you're a 65 year resident in, in Chicago.

And I believe in the infamous 44th ward, if I'm not mistaken.

[Speaker 3] (53:34 - 53:35)
That's correct.

[Speaker 2] (53:35 - 54:18)
I got, I got my birth certificate that says that. Okay. Well, no wonder we put you high on the list for the meeting today.

Thanks for your presentation. We also have some testimonials from participants from the pilot program. We sent you, Nicole sent you the biographies of these.

And we're going to ask them to speak quickly, I believe. And I'll start with, and it looks like it's Gian Foreman, president and CEO of Emerald South economic development collaborative. And we're going to speak separately, right?

[Speaker 22] (54:19 - 54:19)
Okay.

[Speaker 2] (54:20 - 54:22)
All right. Miss video.

[Speaker 11] (54:23 - 56:51)
Yon Foreman. Good afternoon. All the men.

I wear a lot of hats. Some of you guys know me as Emerald South, some Washington park development groups, some from the police board, but in this president. Hello, sir.

In this particular case, I'm speaking about the armor Institute building. The armor building was the original building on the campus of IIT. Beautiful structure.

And, you know, in fact, I T was built around this issue of bringing technology, updating technology, a lot of craftsmen, the trades weren't really growing in the way that, that they needed for the stockyards. And so Mr. Armor built the school that thought was around how to keep technology going. And so many of the advances that we have in building codes, they actually started right here on the campus of IIT plain and simple.

This project would not happen if we did not have the ability to use plastic piping. And we would be in danger. Once again, of losing a very significant piece of Chicago history.

You know, from my perspective, the neighborhoods that I work in and South side and Southwest sides, you know, our communities have, have suffered a lot from, from this investment. And so this plastic piping is just one small way of us thinking about how to kind of keep the projects going. One of the most important things for me is we thought about this building was I thought about the Dearborn homes right up the street.

One of my best friends grew up in the Ickes before they were torn down. The Dearborns are still there. Plastic piping allows us to, to hire guys and ladies from the neighborhood rather than bringing in a crane to lift these things up to the fourth and fifth floors.

We do have the ability to create some opportunities within the community. And this is just one of many buildings that exists like this on the South and West sides of Chicago, and even the North side of Chicago. This will be a housing project, a project that IIT sold to us.

We're using federal historic tax credits, beautiful structures. You can see incredible Tiffany stained glass windows within the building to ensure that a building like this is possible. We have to think about all kinds of fire protections.

Historic buildings are typically kind of inefficient. And so we need all of the savings we can get in order to keep a building like this. So generations, a hundred years from now, we'll be able to look and see a building like this.

[Speaker 2] (56:53 - 57:06)
All right. Very handsome building and appreciate your testimony today. Walter Burnett, Alderman, do you have a point of information because we're going to do Q and A after we hear from the testimonials.

[Speaker 20] (57:08 - 57:19)
Yes, Mr. Chairman, and you know, I'm still in planning too. So I kind of missed something. So, so Mr. Chairman, we're not talking about the plumbing issue anymore.

[Speaker 2] (57:21 - 57:33)
This is first of all, a report on the success of the pilot program with plumbing code changes in this pilot area.

[Speaker 20] (57:33 - 57:34)
Okay.

[Speaker 2] (57:34 - 57:40)
So I just wanted to response and now we're doing the testimonial part.

[Speaker 20] (57:40 - 57:49)
So can you, so I just wanted to get a synopsis of where is the union on this? Of the pilot program? Are they with it or against it?

[Speaker 2] (57:51 - 58:32)
Well, I will speak because they just made their presentation and they are not in support of, of the proposal about PVC generally, especially when it comes to mixed use and commercial. So now there's been a formal introduction of code change. And this is, this is not to be discussed.

We don't have the amendments. We don't have the code changes in front of us. So this is public information, you know, kind of informational only pilot program, but we, we felt it was incumbent that we had the, the union response juxtaposed with the testimonials also.

[Speaker 20] (58:33 - 58:34)
All right. Good deal.

[Speaker 2] (58:34 - 58:34)
Okay.

[Speaker 20] (58:35 - 58:35)
Thank you, sir.

[Speaker 2] (58:36 - 58:41)
Okay. All right. Next we have Nellie Vasquez, Roland president of safe Haven.

[Speaker 6] (58:48 - 58:49)
Hello. Can you hear me?

[Speaker 2] (58:50 - 58:50)
You can.

[Speaker 6] (58:50 - 1:03:22)
You can. Okay. Hello everyone.

Thank you. Chairman and to all the committee members on the zoning landmarks and billing standards. I am here today to give testimony on behalf of the pilot.

For supporting the modernization of the plumbing code. As the beneficiary of this, the pilot program, I can attest that as a developer. Here in the Chicago land area.

That's been in the business for the last 26 years, building transitional supportive, affordable senior and veteran housing. That the cost savings of this project go beyond the material costs and beyond the, the labor costs. The ripple effects of the cost savings.

Continue as we noticed that the, The, the work required in terms of fabricating the required custom. Materials from the cast iron. Pipes is quite costly.

And the availability of the product for the PVC. Is, is much greater and much more ample. Just to give perspective.

I looked this up on the home advisor, just to kind of get a range. In terms of benchmarking the costs. A cast iron pipe.

Iron pipe work runs between two to $10 per foot. PVC plastic runs about 50 cents to $5 a foot. So no matter how you slice it, this is at least a 50% cost savings.

Now we know that with the pandemic, there's been a huge shortage of building materials. And the plumbing materials have not been spared. The cost of the materials have gone up dramatically.

So based on surveying our contractor on the project. We estimate that we've at least saved a hundred thousand dollars just to the material costs. Alone by going with PVC.

Now this is a may not seem like a lot on a $20 million project. But there's cost overruns that happen on construction projects. You know, and thankfully, many of the people that are on this call and in the committee.

We're very supportive in helping us make this project a reality. This is, there's a vacant lot. In North Lawndale.

We were able to get the land donated by the city. We were able to bring in IDA funds and TIF money. Thanks to Alderman Burnett being one.

Alderman Irvin and Alderman Michael Scott. You know, all on the team to help us put this project together. We're very sensitive.

That, you know, all of our stakeholders would like to see cost savings. But, you know, Some of the cost overruns that we didn't expect include the cost of remediation for the land that we did not expect. So thankfully that cost savings helped contribute to help me make that, make that, that gap.

So we do see it as, you know, again, cost savings, availability, material, the flexibility of the material again, because we don't have to custom order weight materials to get developed. We're able to really customize. But also from our perspective, we do see it as safer.

You know, it doesn't require the heat to be poured onsite at CIP hubs, which are a fire hazard in many cases. And the performance, you know, when we were looking at the cost comparisons, we were looking at the performance being pretty, pretty fairly comparable to the cast iron. In fact, you know, one of the things that we liked about it is it does not rust.

So we are, you know, Looking at also the major trends because we are building outside of Chicago and specifically one project that's very similar to this project, which by the way is a 90 unit building that we're building in north Bond Hill. We're building another similar project in Indiana. They're building code does allow for PVC.

We've looked at trends in other markets that we're looking at, including Texas and California and New Orleans. All of the major cities have moved to modernizing the approval of PVC over CIP. Now as a project owner and developer and in partnership with, you know, KMA companies as a developer or GC as GMA, all of the parties involved all are in agreement that this project has saved money, has allowed us to perform on a project and we're hoping to bring it in on schedule.

We're scheduled to do a grand opening, hopefully by a date that's soon to be determined in July. So I invite you to visit our website, ASAPaven.org and contact me if you have any other questions. Thank you.

[Speaker 2] (1:03:23 - 1:03:29)
Thank you very much. Next speaker, Albert Raffin, Raffin Construction.

[Speaker 5] (1:03:31 - 1:08:00)
Okay. Thank you. Chairman Tunney and members of the zoning committee.

I appreciate the opportunity to be able to speak to you today. I'm speaking on behalf of Chicago neighborhood initiatives. CNI for short for whom we have worked in the past.

David Doig, the president, Sierra Boatwright, the vice president, their team are right now cutting the ribbon under their latest project in Poland, which is art space lofts about which I'm to speak today. Just for those who may not know about CNI and their mission, I want to tell you about them and how the plumbing materials program can help groups like them who are bringing forth projects throughout the city. CNI is a nonprofit organization that focuses on high impact real estate development projects and underserved neighborhoods throughout Chicago.

Over the last 10 years, the CNI team has invested a great deal of the resources into development in the Pullman community. The team has coordinated over $450 million of public private investment in the Pullman community, creating over 1,500 new jobs. The developments includes large scale retail and large industrial product projects, but also small neighborhood amenities to support local small business.

They recently developed the 335,000 square foot community center that we were just, it was featured earlier and talked about to help ensure that the youth in this area have safe supervised access to recreation as well as tutoring after school tutoring. They focus on housing development in order to assure affordable homeownership opportunities, as well as traditional affordable housing like the art space loft development that is being dedicated today. The reason I give this background is so that you understand that all cost savings that are realized in their development work goes back into the communities they serve.

So everything that they're able to save. And I think as Nellie was talking about, there's always cost overruns or things that you don't anticipate, especially when you're, when you're working on a piece of property, that's that's in a Brownfield, or if you're trying to develop a rework of building that's existing, there's always things that come up that you're not anticipating. Regarding the art space loft projects, he and I in partnership with some other artists groups developed a plan to save two old apartment buildings that were built in the late 18 hundreds in the Pullman area.

And then both of those buildings were in great need of, of work and renovation monies. They, one of the buildings had actually been abandoned for decades so that they, and the idea was to provide affordable housing for those in the arts community. The plan was designed to do the serious renovation work required for the two buildings and to connect them with a new building in a contemporary Pullman style.

The particulars of the project include there's $18 million in total development costs, 14 million of which is for construction. They developed a 38 affordable work living spaces. There's a 2000 square foot community space.

That's used as a gallery meeting place and a community room for art classes and a variety of cultural programs to serve the entire Pullman community. The project received the 2020 preservation award from the city of Chicago landmarks commission. The savings around $55,000 due to the use of PVC pipe.

They were able to use about 32% of local hiring as part of the project to engage the local community and in the construction work. And there was a substantial M WBE participation on the project. Cause you can see from the photos, if you show the next photo on, it's really turned out to be, it's a beautiful project in the Pullman area.

And I think it'll be something that the community can, can be very proud of in the coming years. Another note we're a general contractor. We often deal with individual owners who are on a tight budget and to whom savings can make a big difference in their projects.

We're currently dealing with a church on the South side of Chicago that suffered serious damage in a fire. They're committed to staying in the neighborhood and the neighborhood wants them to remain. All funds for the rebuild are private and they are struggling to raise the amount of money required or program like this will mean a big difference to them.

Thank you.

[Speaker 2] (1:08:03 - 1:08:23)
Thank you very much. Next is our last testimonial. And then we'll have an engineering company talk about the code.

And then we'll open up for questions. So Alex Sparhawk, DL three realty advisors.

[Speaker 7] (1:08:24 - 1:09:00)
Thank you chairman and committee members for this opportunity to speak today. I hope you can all hear me. My name is Alex Sparhawk.

I'm the director of development for DL three realty. We are a community based development firm that focuses on high impact real estate development projects in underserved communities in Chicago. On this project that we're talking about today, we're working with friend family health center, who is a nonprofit federally qualified healthcare provider.

And we're opening up a new health clinic. And I'm sorry, I missed that.

[Speaker 2] (1:09:01 - 1:09:19)
Your camera was out of focus for me. So you're back. I think Alex, I think you went on that.

You need to unmute yourself now.

[Speaker 7] (1:09:20 - 1:12:05)
Sorry for the technical difficulties. So we are working with friend family health center and we are developing a new health clinic, as well as their headquarters in the medically underserved neighborhood of Woodlawn at 63rd and cottage grove. Friend health has been around since 1997 providing high quality patient centered care with approximately 80% of their patients being Medicaid recipients.

They serve a very vulnerable population. And as a nonprofit healthcare provider, friend health uniquely understands that every penny counts. We're currently in the processing of constructing the health center, which is a new 45,000 square foot health center at 63rd and cottage grove next to the Greenline CTA station.

Health centers regularly require a significant amount of plumbing work to construct. As you can imagine, the building has 57 exam rooms, several restrooms, and practically a sink in every room. This health center will service approximately 35,000 unique patients annually with over a hundred thousand annual encounters on the project.

We're happy to be working with powers and sons as our general contractor and Roka plumbing as our plumbing subcontractor, both of which are Chicago based MBE certified contractors through the pilot program. We were able to realize a significant savings on plumbing materials, although we had estimated a potential savings of about $130,000. We ultimately realized $22,000 of savings on the project by replacing the underground plumbing system with PVC in lieu of cast iron.

We were approved for the use of alternate materials for below and above ground plumbing, but the cost of materials and installation for CPVC, which was required and is a higher grade piping system than PVC at the time, it was trending to be more expensive than copper just as a result of general building cost materials becoming tight this year. So we opted to continue with installation of copper for the above ground plumbing system. We still feel the opportunity to make that decision and provide a cost savings to the project with comparable materials was very important.

And we appreciate the city's effort to offer this pilot program because we believe that these newer piping materials help reduce costs, benefit the environment because they are made from recyclable materials. And by all accounts, they last longer with less deterioration. We believe the ability to lower the cost of construction with safe, comparable materials helps to lower the burden on small businesses and others looking to expand within our city's neighborhoods.

And we applaud the city's efforts. Thank you for the opportunity to speak and share our recent experience with this program. I believe it's programs like these that help bring quality and much needed services to under invested communities in Chicago, south and west sides.

Thank you.

[Speaker 2] (1:12:05 - 1:12:18)
Thank you. Last speaker. Let's see.

President of JB engineering and code consulting. Julius. Again, the biography is in your packet.

[Speaker 4] (1:12:19 - 1:19:06)
Thank you. I've been asked to speak on behalf of the Chicago chapter of American society of plumbing engineers. I'll give you a little perspective from the, the plumbing engineers point of view.

So I'll try not to bore you because those engineers tend to be boring. And I will say Jim and I are good friends because we've both been in the Chicago chapter for a long time. What we do first of all, as engineers is anytime we're dealing with a plumbing material, we're going to look at the performance of that material for the specific application.

In this case, it's drainage waste. And then we also look at the corrosion resistant aspects of the material resistance to the fluid that's being transported. And of course we look at the installation limitations.

Many times that includes the structural support expansion and contraction things of that nature. Finally, we, we do get into involved in the combustibility. Fire is a major concern for us in any building construction.

So if we deal with the combustible material, we look at measures to provide adequate protection. Finally, there's other concerns we get into additional health and safety measures. Sometimes it has to do with joining methods.

You know, if we have to have ventilation in the area when we're joining materials. And finally, one of the more important things for an engineer is to look at the economic impact of a design. So our concern is always in cost.

We have to do be as economical as possible to our clients and provide materials that are going to work. We go to the next slide. You'll see when we do the analysis of PVC and ABS, I included both plastic pipes.

It does provide adequate service for DWV. It is a lighter weight material than your traditional materials. As a result, it's easier to support and it is easier to install.

It's a combustible material. No denying that. As a result of that, we will tend to either enclose it in a shaft or provide what we call penetration protection.

So every time it goes through a rated floor, a rated wall, actually for any floor, we're going to put penetration protection. What happens then is in the event of a fire, it seals off the opening when the pipe melts and burns away. All right.

There is greater expansion and contraction. So that's got to be addressed in the design. It's something that we as engineers take into consideration.

Finally, it is an economical and a lower installed cost material. Let me give you a little background on the history of what the codes have done regarding these materials. The first code to accept the first model code, what we call the model plumbing codes in Chicago has been using as the code.

The basis is the international plumbing code, which is a model plumbing code. So the first model plumbing code to accept a plastic pipe was the Boca basic plumbing code. And that was in 1967.

Also at the same time, about six months later was the national standard plumbing code. So they both came out in 1967. By 1975, PVC and ABS were allowed for, with unlimited use for drainage waste and then DWV in the Boca national plumbing code for the Boca basic plumbing code.

It was called at the time, the SBCCI standard plumbing code and the national standard plumbing code by 1975, the IATMO uniform plumbing code allowed PVC and ABS for two stories or less. Then in 1995, the international plumbing code came out by the combination of a few of the plumbing codes. They have always allowed unlimited use of PVC and ABS for drainage, waste and vent.

By 2000, all the model plumbing codes, that includes the IATMO uniform plumbing code have allowed the unlimited acceptance of PVC and ABS. That would be for any building, including high-rise buildings. We go to the next slide.

I wanted to put together to you what the top 20 cities, and I put them in, in order of population. The population was what I was given for the year 2021. So of course you will see all the item, all the cities in yellow.

So you're dealing with 16 of the top 20 largest cities in the United States allow the use of PVC and ABS and unlimited use. So there is no height limitation. There's no use group limitation.

New York city allows PVC and ABS for DWV and above ground only residential buildings, five stories or less. Philadelphia has a similar limitation. They're above ground residential, but they allow for any building other than high-rise high-rise is defined as 75 feet or greater above the street elevation.

So in other words, if you have a floor level more than 75 feet, you cannot use it. San Francisco is the most limiting. It allows it in two-story residential buildings only.

All right. I apologize for the phone. All the other cities you'll see Los Angeles, Houston, Phoenix, San Antonio, San Diego, Dallas, Austin, Fort Worth.

You keep going down the list. All allow the use of PVC and ABS and unlimited applications. All right.

Again, I will apologize for my phone. Then if you go to the next slide, you'll see that I included some of the nearby Midwest cities and other large metropolitan areas. So Detroit, Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Atlanta, Miami, Salt Lake city, Las Vegas.

If you eliminate Las Vegas from this list and look at the other cities, they have allowed the unlimited use of PVC and ABS and DWV systems for more than 30 years. So there's been a wide use of it. You will find even in these cities, when you go into them, one of the slides that I had that photograph from was actually from Jacksonville, Florida, and I'm showing you PVC pipe.

That was in a 20-something story high rise building. If you went off to the side, you would have seen cast iron as the risers, but all the runout piping was in PVC. And sometimes that's what we as engineers will do.

So just to give you a quick perspective, and I thank you for your time. And again, I'm available for any questions.

[Speaker 2] (1:19:09 - 1:19:40)
All right. So that's the end of our presentation. Now we're going to open it up for questions.

And this would be both for all the witnesses, both for the city and the plumbers, everybody, if they could stay close to the questions from committee members. So we'll start with all of them. Raymond Lopez.

[Speaker 16] (1:19:45 - 1:20:06)
Thank you, Chairman and members of the committee. Thank you to all our panelists. I just had a couple of questions.

I remember when we passed this a few years ago, has there been any study done to see what the economic impact of initiating this pilot has been either for increased productivity, reduced price point or anything like that?

[Speaker 1] (1:20:11 - 1:21:11)
Well, I'll pick a stab. I know we did. We are reporting out the savings of it.

We do able to send you savings in your community, if you would like specific projects. We've seen it as the, as I've reported. And as the, you've heard from the witnesses, this does provide a substantial cost savings, or even if this supplies supplies a little bit of savings, it can be the difference between somebody staying in their home or somebody moving.

So in this economy, and this, this pilot program predates the pandemic, the pandemic has not made it any easier just from people's disposable income to the fact that materials have gone through the roof cost-wise. So, you know, this program has saved money. It will save money.

And above all, I mean, we see it as an equitable opportunity to invest in all neighborhoods.

[Speaker 16] (1:21:13 - 1:21:50)
One of the other questions I had chairman was the last speaker mentioned that there was coatings and things that they could do to protect the pipes in the case of a fire from melting and things of that nature. And I know that was what the unions had also discussed. Has there been any discussion or is there any kind of plan collaboration to see if that can be worked into any kind of extension of this pot?

If this pilot is extended or expanded, if that is something that needs to be written into the ordinance to ally the concern, allay the concerns of the union.

[Speaker 17] (1:21:52 - 1:23:06)
So Alderman Lopez, this is Grand Ole Rick managing deputy commissioner for buildings. Good to see you. So from the beginning of the pilot program, we were very aware again, other places have been using this material much longer than us.

And so when we adopted the pilot program to start, we didn't have a new building code yet. So we required people to follow the fire stopping requirements of the model building code that we were looking to adopt. And then since we've now adopted the 2019 Chicago building code we do require them to follow those national standards for fire stopping.

When you are using a combustible pipe material or, or fire proofing fire safing, when you're using non combustible pipe materials, both of which are stricter than we had in the pre 2019 code, which hadn't been looked at for a while. So we are up to those national standards. There is a cost in adding those fire safety measures, but I think as the last witness testified, that's the engineer's role to help work with the owner and the design team to balance those costs and decide, does it make more sense to spend on fire safing, fire stopping on the pipe materials and balance that.

And that's what we've allowed through the pilot program. So all of the pilot projects have been required to follow those requirements for fire safety.

[Speaker 16] (1:23:07 - 1:23:30)
So then if I may ask, do the fire stopping enhancements, mitigate any cost saving that the PVC pipe may actually generate? Does it come out as a wash between traditional and not non-traditional plumbing? Or is there still, or is it still lower in cost regardless?

Or do we know that yet?

[Speaker 17] (1:23:31 - 1:23:49)
I think again, later on in the process, we focused the application more to make sure that we were getting those numbers, but I know one of our witnesses was a general contractor. He might have the most on the ground perspective on that. So Al, maybe you could provide your perspective on that.

[Speaker 5] (1:23:53 - 1:24:32)
Okay. Well, the only thing I can say is if it's being used widely and we haven't used it widely in ours, we've used it in just a number of jobs where we've gotten the exception, it's used with those requirements and it's still cheaper to do. So it may not be as cheaply if we didn't have those requirements, but in order to do it the right way.

And again, I defer that to the engineer Julius who spoke in the sense that it's got to be designed right. And then the cost savings I think still come in, maybe not as much, but we get it. That's what's required to do it right.

But yes, there are cost savings still.

[Speaker 16] (1:24:34 - 1:24:36)
Thank you. Thank you, chairman.

[Speaker 2] (1:24:36 - 1:25:12)
Thank you. All right. I know that there's well, let me just, let me just interject with a question for the commissioner.

Obviously there was some concerns about fire safety. Will we, or have you consulted with the Chicago fire department and will they be part of our, if, if, and when a draft ordinance is there, I'm sure we're going to probably need their expertise on this too.

[Speaker 1] (1:25:13 - 1:25:51)
So we work closely with the Chicago fire department, John Jaborka and Grant Dahlrich work hand in hand on a lot of the code updates. And you know, we, as Mr. Ruffin said, there is fire stoppage and this is, Grant said there's fire stoppage. And again, this is, this is an optional material.

This is giving another option as some of the speakers said to to have this, we have the same debate all the time between wood versus masonry. So wood burns, masonry doesn't, but we do allow wood construction in the city. I'm in a wood frame home myself, but there is a certain fire protections that you put on wood frame homes as well.

[Speaker 2] (1:25:54 - 1:26:02)
All right. Any other questions before we close off the this meeting?

[Speaker 19] (1:26:04 - 1:26:07)
And I know I got chairman, I got a question.

[Speaker 2] (1:26:07 - 1:26:21)
Well, before we get to vice chair Alderman Rod Sawyers, I've been on the call and also Mike Rodriguez. So that's, that's what we've got listed on our roll call. All right, Ariel.

[Speaker 19] (1:26:24 - 1:26:35)
Thanks chairman and commissioner of, of the testimonies that I've heard, I didn't hear anything about single family homes. Where are we with that?

[Speaker 1] (1:26:35 - 1:27:28)
This is used in single family homes as well. And again, when you see that the spread of the spreading the wealth throughout the neighborhoods, there are a lot of single family homes that, that use this. And this is very important.

If you're rehabbing a single family home, you're trying to to bring it back online. And also, as I mentioned, if you're trying to stay in your home, whether it's a single family home or multifamily, this could be the difference between somebody fixing their home and staying there and staying in their communities or having to be priced out and uprooted and leave. So it does impact single family homes as well.

And small businesses as well. I know we heard from some of the larger developments, but this is really also being used in single family homes and small businesses with great success.

[Speaker 19] (1:27:31 - 1:27:42)
But I don't, I don't know where the, where the union is on this, on the single family homes, pretty much the same as the testimony.

[Speaker 3] (1:27:42 - 1:28:06)
As in my testimony back in 1990, it was put in the Chicago code for single family homes. I'm pretty sure that was put in. Yes.

Back in 1990, it was put in there for residential.

[Speaker 22] (1:28:07 - 1:28:09)
To allow it Jim.

[Speaker 3] (1:28:09 - 1:28:23)
To allow it. In 1990, some 30 some years ago, it was put in the code for single family residence or three stories or less back in 1990.

[Speaker 19] (1:28:23 - 1:28:25)
Okay. All right. Thank you.

Thank you.

[Speaker 13] (1:28:25 - 1:29:06)
And also this Jones Richmond, like I said, I used to be a permanent inspector for the city of Chicago. All the inspection I did when they rehabbing houses, when you rehab a house, somebody's talking about cost savings. You can put in a PVC, a step for the underground.

So normally when you're doing a single family home, people usually don't trust the underground unless it's in the bathroom in the basement, but rehabbing the rest of the building is already been PVC. So to me, the cost savings, no offense commissioner, I'm not trying to debate with you, but the homeowner to save the money already since 1990. Thank you.

[Speaker 3] (1:29:08 - 1:29:16)
Commissioner that went through a city council back on May 16th of 1990. By the way, that's when it went into the code.

[Speaker 2] (1:29:18 - 1:29:22)
That was when, uh, Roy has joined the council, wasn't it?

[Speaker 19] (1:29:22 - 1:29:24)
No, just shortly.

[Speaker 3] (1:29:26 - 1:30:06)
The code is a living document, gentlemen and ladies, you know, and it's continuously updated year after year. You know, things go to this, you know, our great city council, um, you know, year after year. And, you know, we put this stuff in there because, you know, we're a state of the art city and, uh, we try to keep our codes up for, you know, up to date through the building, uh, high rise buildings and unique structures and stuff that we do build in Chicago.

And that's why we have the city of Chicago forming code. And we shy away from other codes that don't have unique buildings that we do in Chicago.

[Speaker 2] (1:30:07 - 1:30:11)
All right. All right. Thank you.

Raymond Lopez is back.

[Speaker 16] (1:30:11 - 1:30:20)
I just want to say in 1990, I was in sixth grade, by the way, I'm going to leave that one.

[Speaker 2] (1:30:21 - 1:30:28)
I'm going to leave that completely alone. I can't, I would respond, but not, not in a public meeting.

[Speaker 3] (1:30:28 - 1:31:12)
So, um, all right. I got a question. Who is that Jim?

Yeah, it's Jim Majerowicz again. You know, they keep talking about these cost savings of plastic pipe. Is it really a cost savings or are they just using these numbers from 1990 on, which we had these cost savings back in 1990.

And these people that are shocked, they're talking about the pilot program and so forth. Are they, you know, they're neglecting that this has been in for three stories buildings and are less than height since 1990. So are they maybe, or, you know, the numbers, are they looking at the pilot program?

Are they looking at a 30 year old code?

[Speaker 1] (1:31:13 - 1:31:26)
They're looking at the pilot program, Mr. Chairman. And these numbers are, these numbers are from the pilot program. So they are people that have applied to use this and have used this.

These are the savings that are being reported out.

[Speaker 2] (1:31:26 - 1:31:35)
And also some of our witnesses and testimonials. Uh, speaking of that, I see Gian, did you have your hand up?

[Speaker 11] (1:31:35 - 1:31:42)
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I was going to report that these are actual cost savings.

The armor building would have to be torn down.

[Speaker 2] (1:31:42 - 1:31:45)
No, no, no. We couldn't have, we don't, you couldn't do that. That's yeah.

[Speaker 11] (1:31:46 - 1:31:52)
So it's, it's actual real cost savings in 2021, not 1990 call say 2021 call say.

[Speaker 1] (1:31:54 - 1:31:59)
All right. And those other witnesses just said it's reinvestment into those projects.

[Speaker 2] (1:32:00 - 1:33:03)
All right. Any other questions from, uh, committee members there? Um, I do not see any hands up.

Um, so with that, I would like to get a motion to adjourn. And as I said to Alderman Burnett, uh, you know, in the near future, you'll probably see an ordinance introduction. We don't have that, uh, available to us to even examine at this point.

So I'm sure there'll be plenty of, uh, further negotiations. And, uh, again, if, and when it's introduced, it'll come back to the committee, but it's not the first time you've seen the presentation and maybe there'll be some tweaks on it, um, in the near future. So with that, um, that is Alderman Ray Lopez moves to adjourn any objections to the motion.

Hearing none, uh, meetings adjourned. Have a great afternoon. Thanks everybody on all sides of the issue.
