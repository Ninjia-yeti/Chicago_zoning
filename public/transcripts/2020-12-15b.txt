And... Okay.

[Speaker 3] (7:45 - 8:17)
All right. There are 27 members of the joint committee. There are 18 members present, including myself.

We have a quorum. At this time, we'll now begin the public comment period. Out of respect for everyone's time, each speaker is limited to three minutes.

We have six speakers signed up today. And we will start with Diane Lemus. Yes.

Diane.

[Speaker 12] (8:18 - 8:20)
Yes, I'm here. Can you hear me?

[Speaker 3] (8:21 - 8:23)
Yes, we can. You can proceed.

[Speaker 12] (8:24 - 11:23)
All right. Thank you. My name is Diane Lemus.

I'm a volunteer with Communities United, a grassroots organization that works on several social justice issues. We thank the mayor and the Department of Housing for all their work in putting the pilot ADU ordinance together and the positive changes that were made. However, if this ordinance is going to be successful, the city needs to view this law and its implementation through an equity lens.

This means putting structures in place to ensure that people who need this ordinance the most, the people who have been historically disenfranchised, families that find it hard to qualify for government programs, get a fair chance to participate and build wealth with the help of this ordinance. The city needs to realize how important it is to do an extensive education program in communities about the ADU, its policies and programs, and apply an equity lens to outreach strategies and make sure all intended audiences are informed. The city should commit to providing resources to support community organizations that can help landlords manage the ADU process and related programs, since some of these processes are complicated.

We know that many vulnerable households, especially our immigrant communities, mistrust working with the city departments, such as the Department of Buildings. Presenting too many complex steps for households that lack experience and training in how to navigate the process to access financial assistance could be a barrier to access. We need coordination between city departments.

Metrics and evaluation are important. The city needs to evaluate success with an equity lens. Our undocumented families, our black and brown folks, and the people with disabilities able to take advantage of the ADU substitute ordinance, its policies, and its programs.

What this ordinance lacks is not allowing by rights RS1 districts to participate. This includes many of our disinvested areas that are not being represented. By not including all areas of the city to participate, we will not create the affordable units of housing that we imagined three years ago.

It also does not allow conversion of ground-level commercial space into accessible affordable housing units for people with disabilities. Again, this city should roll out financial and technical assistance programs along with the ordinance and be willing to make adjustments as needed. To eventually make this a citywide ADU ordinance that will lead to creating more affordable housing.

Thank you.

[Speaker 3] (11:24 - 11:31)
Thank you, Diane. Thank you, Diane. Our next speaker is Paul Colgan.

[Speaker 16] (11:38 - 14:21)
Good afternoon. Can you hear me? Good afternoon.

Okay. I am Paul Colgan with the Home Builders Association of Greater Chicago. The Home Builders support accessory dwelling units or ADUs as a positive response to the need for naturally occurring affordable housing in all neighborhoods.

It is disappointing that once again the city is ready to set limits on a program that could provide hundreds, if not thousands, of affordable living units in areas where they are needed most. I realize that small steps must be required to get started, but you could do so much more with this first step. You should be encouraging ADUs, not discouraging them.

Here are a few questions for your consideration. First of all, most importantly, ask yourself, could an ordinary person understand this ordinance as written and navigate this process without hiring a zoning lawyer, which only adds unnecessary costs? Are these rules and regulations transparent, equitable, and easy to understand?

If the answer is no, then more work is required. Second, why eliminate the use to only two units per year on facing blocks? This will create a very difficult situation if more than two people seek ADUs every year.

Who do you pick? How? Why?

There should be a mechanism for exceptions if neighbors want to allow more. Third, why the arbitrary 20-year building age minimum for an ADU? ADUs should be allowed on far more properties, even coach houses and new construction.

Fourth, since ADUs are one of the best ways to create new affordable housing, why exclude areas crying out for that housing, like all of the 606 and Pilsen areas? The aldermen who are vocal advocates for affordable housing in these areas should be begging to be part of this program to meet the needs of their constituents. I urge those aldermen to amend the map to include all of the 606 and 18th Street corridors.

Fifth, why are there different rules for the northwest and south side? This is another example of a necessary piecemeal zoning policy. Finally, why only a three-year review?

Why not require annual reports? Have the Department of Housing come before you each and every year to report on whether this is working. Unfortunately, this first step may not fulfill its promise because it falls far shorter with the Urban Land Institute ADU Task Force recommended, which was to require the fewest possible restrictions.

But a first step, even a shaky one, is needed. I urge you to take the time to make a few more changes, however, before passing it. We have the time.

It doesn't take real effect until May 1, 2021. Why rush now? Get it right.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

[Speaker 3] (14:24 - 14:31)
Thank you, Paul. Our next speaker is Swasti Shah. I hope I got that right.

[Speaker 14] (14:35 - 14:38)
Good afternoon. This is Swasti. Are you able to hear me?

[Speaker 3] (14:39 - 14:42)
We do hear you. Proceed.

[Speaker 14] (14:42 - 17:38)
Thank you. Good afternoon, Chairman Tunney, Chairman Osterman, and Aldermen. My name is Swasti Shah.

I'm the Director of Community Engagement for the Chicago offices of ULI, the Urban Land Institute, and I'm speaking today on behalf of ULI. Many of you might recall our presentation from the July Joint Committee meeting where we had shared findings from a year-long ADU initiative and expressed our support for the proposed ordinance. I'm happy to reiterate that support today.

We believe that legalizing ADUs is a smart move for Chicago, just like it has been for countless cities across the country. A strong ADU policy can be an effective tool in the housing toolbox for many reasons. ADUs are a private market solution that can deliver new housing units at a lower cost than typical new construction units.

Because they utilize non-primary spaces such as basements, ADUs are typically more affordable than regular units in their neighborhoods. And they can provide a rental income stream for a homeowner, thereby increasing financial stability for them. Or they can be a place for a family member, allowing multiple generations to live together.

And the COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of allowing for these types of flexible living situations. Another important lesson that we learned from other cities is that ADUs are not easy to build. Legalizing ADUs doesn't automatically result in a ton of stuff.

And that's because most of the people building them are homeowners or small property owners. And if the process is too complex or too expensive, they're not going to be able to go through with it. Regulatory flexibility and streamlined approvals are key.

Chicago's proposed ADU ordinance incorporates many best regulatory practices. And although not perfect, we believe it's a good ordinance. We also believe that to achieve equitable outcomes and reach middle and lower income households, the city will need to roll out a robust program of technical and financial support.

To make sure vulnerable residents can trust and access these programs, support should be provided in partnership with delegate agencies and community-based organizations. And should include things like free site evaluations, permitting assistance, and grants or low-cost loans. These programs should be based on income eligibility and tied to affordability requirements.

We also recommend that the city develop metrics, including equity metrics to measure the success of the ADU ordinance, and be open to revisions to improve outcomes. For example, we believe that ADUs should be allowed by right in all residential zones, including RS1, and throughout the city, not just the pilot zones. Also, chronically vacant commercial spaces in targeted areas should be considered for conversion into accessible ADUs.

I'd like to conclude by saying that ULR Chicago believes that legalizing ADUs is a step forward in the right direction towards addressing Chicago's housing challenges. We hope that the ordinance passes, and we look forward to working with community and industry partners to support the city in successfully implementing it. Thank you.

[Speaker 3] (17:39 - 17:43)
Thank you. Our next speaker, Marty Cerny.

[Speaker 9] (17:43 - 21:00)
Thank you. Marty Cerny here for 15 years, consistent in favor of converting unproductive spaces to residential dwelling units. With the presence of the affordable, accessible, and fair housing crises, our nonprofit Housing Plus has been advocating for a systematic approach to engage participation from all publics, the private real estate community, housing advocates, and government agencies to be ambitious together and to take the fight to these debilitating trends.

We authored a proposed ordinance that was eventually introduced to city council two years ago with 18 co-sponsors and the purpose of producing cost-effective dwelling units at scale. The ordinance was then held up for the election and canceled upon the arrival of the new administration. Having the feeling from twice meeting with mayoral candidate Lightfoot that a bold initiative seemed plausible, hope reigned that your committees would offer an ADU approach that took responsibility to carve deeply into the housing deficits plaguing so many.

We enthusiastically participated with ULI to develop recommendations for how Chicago could adopt a progressive approach. After all, the cost of poorly addressing these issues is in the tens of billions. While disappointed, the May version of this ordinance preceded and thusly excluded our recommendations.

We were heartened by requests to offer modifications, which we did and circulated in August. At some point, conversion units began being referenced as a method to add gentle density. Gentle density is what led us to the housing crisis facing the city.

There's nothing gentle about a massive shortage in housing. There's nothing gentle about thousands of wheelchair-bound people dragging themselves across a crappy bathroom floor and into a poorly tiled shower because ADA accommodations aren't available. There's nothing gentle about policies that produce affordable housing at over $300,000 a unit.

This ordinance also seems to defy basic economic influence of real estate, including return on investment and encumbrances and how they affect the property owner's decision. In plain English, ADUs are not a financial bonanza and may not always operate at a profit. And where economies of scale may come into play for multi-unit production, the ordinance's heavy-handed restrictions, like encumbrances and treble damages, discourage participation from those volunteers we need the most, housing providers with resourcefulness, and property types most conducive for volume production and people with mobility impairments.

Instead of going big, this proposition is rationed participation of private owners. Participation rationing. This is going in the wrong direction.

Our city needs purposeful volume production, a serious collaborative effort, and to place people first. Instead, this ordinance looks to impose impediments and lock us into a gentle density approach for the next three years. Only in reality, void of COVID implications, there's something gentle about kicking the can down the road for another three years.

[Speaker 3] (21:01 - 21:24)
Thank you, Marty. Our next speaker, Sarah Bruins. Chairman, this is Alderman Sawyer.

He's present for the purpose of the quorum. Thank you, Alderman. I know there's a number that jumped on after the roll call, so when we get finished with the public speakers, I'll query the rest of us that have joined.

Okay, thank you. All right, Sarah?

[Speaker 19] (21:26 - 21:26)
Yes.

[Speaker 3] (21:27 - 21:27)
Proceed.

[Speaker 19] (21:28 - 23:44)
Thank you. Thank you, Chairman Osterman, Chairman Tunney, and members of the Housing and Zoning Committees for today's hearing. My name is Sarah Bruins.

I'm here on behalf of Neighborhood Housing Services of Chicago, where I serve as public policy strategist. NHS is a longtime single-family affordable housing partner with the city. We provide loans, rehab, financing, as well as homebuyer education.

I'm here today to convey NHS's support for this ordinance that will allow ADUs to be built in targeted zones across the city. We hope that it will lead to a citywide adoption of ADU policies in the future. The first most urgent reason to legalize ADUs is the gap of well over 100,000 affordable housing units needed in Chicago.

ADUs are naturally more affordable than traditional units and will increase the inventory of these desperately needed units in the targeted zones. For that reason, it's been a top priority for many housing advocates for years, and we thank the Chairman Osterman and others who have done tons of work on this ordinance to bring it to fruition. Secondly, ADUs are an important wealth-building resource for many of the homeowners we serve.

If a single-family or two-to-four-unit owner-occupant can add a rental unit to their property, they create a source of income for themselves to cover their taxes and add value to their home. It can also be a resource to allow older owners to age in place. We hear about this often from our homebuyers and owners.

Some subsidies will be needed to ensure that ADUs are created equitably across the city, and we're glad to see that there are efforts being made by the city for rehab grants as well as some rental subsidies. These programs are a great start, but I want to impress that these efforts must be ongoing. A typical basement unit can cost homeowners anywhere from $50,000 to $100,000 depending on what they have to do to bring their unit up to code.

To provide some additional resources, NHS is completing a comprehensive manual with input from the city for owner-occupants, walking them through the entire process of an ADU construction project. These are the types of resources we need if we want ADUs to be created by owner-occupants and not just in large or multifamily buildings. NHS is committed to continuing this work.

Thank you for your time and consideration of the ordinance. We're in support for all of these reasons. Our clients are very excited about using this new housing type, and we hope to see it come to fruition as soon as possible.

[Speaker 3] (23:45 - 23:49)
Thank you, Sarah. Our final speaker is Rosanna Marquez.

[Speaker 11] (23:52 - 23:54)
Good afternoon. Can you hear me?

[Speaker 3] (23:54 - 23:55)
We can. Proceed.

[Speaker 11] (23:55 - 27:01)
All right. Excellent. Hello.

My name is Rosanna Marquez, and I'm the State President of AARP Illinois. AARP is a nonpartisan, nonprofit, nationwide organization that helps empower the 50-plus to choose how they live as they age and fight for the issues that matter most to the 50-plus and their families. I'm here today representing the 250,000 AARP members and all older adults who live in Chicago.

AARP strongly supported the accessory dwelling unit ordinance as originally proposed, but welcomes this substitute ordinance as an important first step and looks forward to its expansion citywide. By 2030, one in five Americans will be age 50 and older. It's critical that communities address their range of needs now.

According to AARP's 2018 Home and Community Preference Survey, nearly 80 percent of adults age 50 and older want to remain in their communities and homes as they age. However, approximately one in three reports that to do so, major modifications to their homes are needed to accommodate their aging needs. In addition, although the presence of ADUs is low, seven in ten would consider building an ADU for a loved one who needs care.

It's no secret that the city of Chicago is facing an unprecedented housing shortage and affordability crisis. The magnitude of housing challenges for low and moderate income residents in particular signals a problem in Chicago that deserves solutions driven by increasing the supply of diverse housing options and land use policies. The ADU Pilot Ordinance is the first step toward alleviating this concern.

The ADU Pilot Ordinance is an important beginning to provide opportunities for those age 50 plus to age in the communities they call home. This in turn allows these Chicagoans to continue serving as a stabilizing force and anchors of their communities. In the six pilot areas of Chicago proposed, older adults and their families will be able to benefit from this innovative housing model.

For example, by allowing for the creation of a place for a caregiver or adult child to live that preserves the independence of both. They also would provide empty nesters and other older adults a chance to move into a smaller space while allowing an adult child and their family live in the larger space. An ADU can also generate extra income to help homeowners cover mortgage payments or simply make ends meet, something especially important for older adults on a fixed income.

Everything I've laid out so far predates the COVID-19 crisis. The pandemic has only served to underscore the importance and urgency of moving forward with this ordinance. This is because all of the options I've laid out offer families and their loved ones an alternative to being forced to move into a nursing home, an especially dangerous proposition during these fraught COVID-19 times.

The proposed ordinance simplifies the process for creating ADUs in a way that will make it feasible and affordable for Chicagoans 50 plus to do so.

[Speaker 3] (27:02 - 27:49)
Thank you, Rosanna. That concludes the public commentary portion of the meeting. For the record, I want to say that Alderman Beals' member is on the call.

Alderman Maldonado, Alderman Villegas, Alderman Siccio-Lopez, and Alderman Sawyer will be recorded as members of these two committees. We have non-members present that I can see so far. Alderman Vasquez, Alderman Thompson, Alderman Ramirez-Rosa, Alderman Nugent, I believe, is on, and Alderman Silverstein.

So, if I've missed anybody, speak up. Okay. All right.

[Speaker 11] (27:49 - 27:53)
Well, we have- Mr. Chairman, Alderman Maldonado is here.

[Speaker 3] (27:54 - 28:55)
Yes, sir. We have you down. Thank you.

So, obviously, we have more than our share for the quorum. We have one item on the agenda this afternoon. This is Ordinance Number 02020-2850, the Amendment of Municipal Code Titles 2, 4, and 17 by modifying various provisions governing affordable dwelling units.

It is my understanding we have a substitute on this matter. Chairman Osterman moves to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to the motion?

Hearing none, the substitute is accepted. We've got our Commissioner on Housing, Navarro, and Zoning Administrator Patrick Murphy. But before we begin with our city departments, I'm going to ask if Chairman Osterman would like to say a few words.

[Speaker 8] (28:55 - 30:49)
I'll be real brief, Chairman Taney, and I want to thank all the members of both committees who are here with us today. We're here with a substitute ordinance that followed a pretty extensive subject matter hearing that we had previously and a lot of conversations and a lot of feedback. So the substitute, I think, reflects a lot of comments we heard from our colleagues.

A couple of things I want to say, and then I'll turn it over to Commissioner Navarro and Pat Murphy, and that is this. This ordinance that you have before us is not going to solve all of the problems of housing that we face in the city of Chicago. It is a tool, one tool amongst many.

It's a tool that private homeowners and property owners can use to add units that by nature are affordable. And so that's a key thing that I wanted to point out. Through a lot of conversations, there are five pilot areas established across the city of Chicago.

I think it's the goal that we as a committee and council members look at the results of this over the next few years, but ultimately we want to add units. A lot of the comments that were made by the speakers who joined us today, I think are accurate. I think education is going to be critical.

I think the department of housing is poised to show Chicago residents and homeowners and property owners how this can be used in a way that's accessible and equitable. And I think it's going to be a positive initiative as we look at many other initiatives related to housing to really get at the issues that we have as a city. So with that, I'll comment later, but I'd like to now, Chairman Tunney, turn it over to Patrick Murphy, who will be followed by commissioner Navarro unless commissioner Navarro would like to go first.

[Speaker 2] (30:53 - 32:40)
Thank you both chairman commissioner Osterman. I will, I'll start out and then I'll turn it over to commissioner Navarro and Daniel Hertz. And we have a series of slides that we'll go through the talk about the text and give you some background information on the districts, as well as a refresher of all the zoning aspects involved.

So good afternoon, chairman and members of the committees for the record. My name is Patrick Murphy with the department of planning and development. As I said, I'm joined here today by commissioner Navarro and Daniel Hertz from the city's department of housing.

We're also joined by representatives of the city's department of business affairs and consumer protection, as well as buildings. And we are here to discuss proposed changes to certain sections of the Chicago municipal code, as they relate to the introduction of additional dwelling units, including coach houses in the city of Chicago, as chairman Tunney noted, there's a substitute ordinance today. Thank you for accepting that.

And that reflects a number of changes that we've discussed internally, as well as with subject matter experts outside of the city. And this joint committee here, we would like for you to discuss and consider this substitute. And it addresses the following changes since we originally introduced this one, it provides affordability provisions specific to the Chicago housing authority by excluding the CHA from any lesser affordability standards to it incorporates districts caps and associated rules and three restricts zoning allowances pertaining to the legalization of conversion units and coach houses to the aforementioned districts.

The provision of these standards, like I said, has been included since the original ordinance amendment was introduced. Thank you chairman. And with that, I'll turn it over to commissioner Navarro and we'll get back to discuss some of the other zoning details later on this afternoon.

[Speaker 1] (32:43 - 42:23)
Thank you. Zoning administrator Murphy just gave you the what, and I would like to spend a moment on the why and the context that we're in. My name is Marisa Navarro and commissioner of the department of housing.

In 1957, a major plan development ordinance was passed. I think it's important to note what was going on at that time. There had been rapid population growth after world war II and demographers were actually incorrectly forecasting that the city was going to reach 4 million people by 1980.

So at this time there was a major push for suburbanization and more individual space. And there was fear of overcrowding within the city. So the 1957 ordinance tried to address what they thought was coming by upzoning the downtown area, making way for many of the residential high rises that we now see there.

But the ordinance also outlawed additional dwelling units in neighborhoods, in theory, to protect against a rush of population that did not in fact materialize. Coach houses that already existed were allowed to remain, but many were demolished in the following decades as their use was discouraged. Today, needless to say, we're in much different circumstances than we were in 1957.

Rather than population growth, we're experiencing population loss. Many homeowners are struggling to stay in their homes as their property taxes rise. Many aging homeowners would like to stay in their homes as they age, if they had the income to make needed repairs.

And as we have seen with COVID-19, many households are living intergenerationally and want more options to be able to do so. Next slide, please. So more on today, you know, in recent years, we have seen other cities ahead of us that are taking steps to legalize ADUs within their cities.

We've seen them over time. Many times they have started small, learned, made changes and kind of evolved over time. So that's something we have looked to and learned from in other peer cities.

Also the Urban Land Institute, starting in August 2019 convened nearly 100 community industry and public sector stakeholders in a series of workshops, specifically here in Chicago. City of Chicago staff worked closely with them on that effort and their detailed recommendations played a significant role in drafting this ordinance. So we were very grateful to them for their good work.

We also, many of you were present for a subject matter hearing that we held in July in which we received hours of public and aldermanic feedback. And we're here before you today with a substitute ordinance that reflects those inputs and apply them to pilot areas. So I'll get into more detail on affordability provisions, but before I do, I just want to say one more word on context, which is from the department of housing's perspective.

One of the principles that guides our work is that with a 120,000 unit affordable housing gap and shrinking federal resources, we have to do two things. We have to expand affordable housing sources and find new and improved ways to create below market rental units that are not dependent on the city to subsidize. So ADUs help us with that second goal.

One of our solutions to the problem of scarcity of affordable housing and scarcity of public resources is to stop making it difficult. And in the case of coach houses, impossible for property owners to create below market rental units at a low density neighborhood scale, we should be doing everything we can to encourage rather than discourage ADUs. And as chairman Osterman said, to be clear, this is just one of many steps we need to take to address that gap.

There's no one ordinance or one program that's going to transform our housing landscape by itself, but this is a step that we can and should take. So to the ordinance that you have in front of you, as you can see, with essentially a building is allowed one unit as the equivalent of 33%. So units one through four, you get, you're allowed one additional unit.

It's not until you get to five units or more that we begin to see two units be allowed. And that is when we begin to see affordability provisions kick in. And I'll say more about that on the next slide.

So here you can see that if more than one additional dwelling unit is being added, then every other unit must be affordable. So you can see that conversion that happens here. We envision that for one unit, this is really occurring largely in owner occupied two flats, let's say, or a single family home.

And in that case, what we're looking to is that really the benefit there is accruing to the homeowner and their ability to have additional income to make repairs or pay their taxes and so on. Once we get larger than that, we do start to have a expectation for affordability. And I'll say a bit more next on the other ways that the city is providing some affordability measures here.

So our other affordability provisions, we have coordinated with the Chicago low-income housing trust fund to provide subsidies for up to 75 additional dwelling units. This will provide rents affordable to people making 30% of the area median income and below that's about $25,000 a year for a family of four, which is where many of our community partners indicate that people that are living in existing ADUs right now, that's the incomes that we need to hit. Property owners will be made aware of the option to secure a trust fund subsidy during the application process and Aldermanic offices will be ensuring that this information is shared as well.

We also have established a grant for low and moderate income homeowners to build ADUs. We allocated $1.1 million in CDBG in 2021 for grants to low and moderate income homeowners to bring existing ADUs up to code through the neighborhood lending program. We're working out exactly how much of the dollar amount of each of those grants, but our current neighborhood lending program grants are in the neighborhood of $30,000 each.

The other thing that we would do here though, is to make additional funds available above and beyond the amount we settle on if the work will create an accessible additional dwelling unit. So we would provide additional funds both as an incentive and in recognition that sometimes there are additional costs to that because the accessibility feature here is very important to us. And we heard that loud and clear from our community partners.

Other regulations on the West, South and Southeast zones, no more than two permits per block per year. Buildings that are three units or less must be owner occupied and coach houses cannot be built on a lot without a primary structure. And I did want to speak to this.

We heard about this a bit in public comment. And I'd like to explain that because what the question was, why have different rules? And the reason is that when we talk to people across the city, we heard very, very different concerns.

And so the point of a pilot is to try different things and to learn different things. And I'll give an example here of something that we heard. We heard from some folks in neighborhoods that have long been struggling with disinvestment, that their concern was in their community already, they feel that they have too many investor owners of single family homes and two flats, and they did not want to make it any more attractive or maximize any more profit for investor owners to buy in their community versus allowing for owner occupants.

And so this was a measure that we agreed could help to stem against that concern to say, if we're talking about buildings that people would really prefer were owner occupied, then we'll note that that's the provision that needs to take place in those communities. That's not a concern that we hear everywhere. And so the point of a pilot again is to try things out, to learn from them and report back on what we learned.

And to the question also that we heard of, you know, why wait three years to report back? We're not waiting three years to report back. Any of you who attend the committee meetings on housing and real estate know that we report quarterly and we will include any progress on this program in our quarterly reports along the way.

Our agreement on three years was simply that by the three year mark, the department of housing and the department of planning will be reporting back on, on what we've learned in totality during that time and what our recommendations are moving forward. With that, I will turn it over to department of housing's policy director, Daniel Hertz, and he'll explain a bit more about the pilot areas.

[Speaker 4] (42:26 - 47:58)
Thank you, commissioner. Good afternoon members of the committee. My name is Daniel Hertz.

I am the director of policy for the department of housing, and I'll give a brief overview of the pilots and, and some of the reasons that we landed on a pilot program at all on these in particular. So the goal of moving to a pilot program is to learn about how this policy plays out in the wide diversity of neighborhoods in Chicago. And in order to be able to adopt best practices on those learnings, when we move towards, or if we choose to move towards a broader policy in three years time, as we were working with Aldermanic offices, community organizations, department staff, and analysts on selecting these locations, what we were aiming for is to have a representative sample of the, all the different kinds of neighborhood contexts that may affect the way that this policy plays out on the ground in real life. So that includes obviously geographies, different sides of the city.

And as you can see, we have five pilot areas, North, Northwest, West, South and Southeast. But we also wanted to make sure that we are incorporating different built environments. So everything from single family home neighborhoods to areas that are predominantly, you know, two flats to six flats, to communities that have larger multifamily buildings like courtyard buildings with basement areas that may be built out with ADUs.

We also wanted to include a range of different neighborhoods. One of the slides before that the commissioner spoke to included a map of existing coach houses around the city. We wanted to include a range of neighborhoods, both that already have a density of coach house structures, some of which may be occupied, some of which may not, as well as neighborhoods that do not have the same amount of density of those, of those accessory structures.

In addition, we wanted a range of different market conditions. The commissioner also spoke to the fact that we have tailored many of the regulations and rules around ADUs to recognize that needs are different and concerns are different and opportunities are different in places where, you know, disinvestment has been a problem versus areas where there's a very tight housing market and, and, and, you know, need for, for more units through, through ADUs. And then also just an opportunity to spread again around different neighborhoods for different types of needs of tenants and owners.

You know, again, additional supply of housing to offset deconversions, for example, in some of the gentrifying areas, multi-generational living, as well as income for homeowners. So with that, I'll give a brief overview of the, of the pilot zones. So first we have the North zone, which is on the screen right now.

This covers parts of the Westridge, Edgewater, Uptown, Lakeview, North center and Lincoln square community areas. And as you can see predominantly is on the North lake front West to the river. Next slide, please.

The next is the Northwest zone, which stretches from parts of the near West side and East Garfield park up into West town follows the Milwaukee corridor up through Logan square and Avondale, and then goes North into parts of Albany park to cover a range of different areas of different ages, again, different housing typologies and areas where we know there's a density of existing ADUs as well. The West zone covers portions of the North and South Lawndale little village community areas. Again, on the West side, up to the city limits, again, covering, and in this case, areas where there is a density of existing ADUs.

The next area is the South area, which covers a number of community areas starting on the West with Ashburn, Auburn Gresham, West Lawn, Chicago Lawn, Washington Heights, Roseland, Chatham, Greater Grand Crossing, Englewood and West Englewood, Washington Park, Woodlawn and Grand Boulevard community areas with a wide range of housing typologies in this area, ranging from single family to larger multifamily buildings on the Eastern and Northern ends. And then finally the Southeast area, which covers parts of the South Chicago East side, South Deering and Hegwash community areas.

Again, covering a diversity of housing typologies from single, predominantly single family to smaller multifamily and also covering both areas that have a relatively low density of existing ADUs, as well as especially on the Northern end of the zone areas with a relatively high density of ADUs. And with that, I will turn it back to Patrick Murphy from DPD.

[Speaker 2] (48:00 - 50:15)
Thank you. The zoning specific details, as reflected in this proposed substitute ordinance amendment are designed as follows. And I will note over these next eight or so slides, all of this imagery and these calculations will mirror what we discussed with you all earlier this summer at the joint hearing.

One, it will allow in certain residential non-downtown zoning districts, new dwelling units in a building that includes at least one legally established dwelling unit. Such quantities of new units will be capped at the greater of one or one third of those units that were lawfully established at least 20 years ago. I'll try to reset my camera here.

Sorry about that. Two, this will allow for additional units to be established by right in all residential districts, except RS1 where they will be prohibited. Three, this will exempt these new units from required accessory parking, open space and minimum lot area standards.

However, applicable open space impact fees will apply. Four, this will allow coach houses to be reoccupied regardless of the previous restrictions, or they can be established new. Five, this will allow coach houses to be as large as 700 square feet and 22 feet in height.

Existing coach houses can only be expanded to these same limitations, but in no case can they provide more than one dwelling unit for occupancy purposes. And six, neither conversion units nor coach houses established pursuant to this ordinance may be occupied as vacation rental or shared housing units. The departments are proposing this substitute ordinance amendment in conjunction with the city's department of buildings and BACP after consultation with other city authorities and agencies.

Myself, commissioner Navarro, Mr. Hertz, as well as, like I said, representatives from housing and BACP are here to answer any questions that you may have. Thank you.

[Speaker 3] (50:17 - 50:33)
Okay. Okay. So I will entertain questions.

Use your raise hand function. We're going to start with Alderman Kappelman.

[Speaker 8] (50:34 - 50:42)
Chairman Tunney, if I could real quickly, when I add Alderman Matt Martin and Alderman Byron Sitko Lopez to the role.

[Speaker 3] (50:43 - 51:20)
Okay. We got it. Thank you.

Alderman Kappelman. Before we get to Alderman Kappelman, I think there's, I made one footnote on the presentations that I haven't heard yet. So let me, I think this is to you Patrick or the building department.

The substitute says that the issuance of a building permit for a conversion unit or a coach house, the applicant must provide written notice to abutting neighbors in the local alderman. That is correct.

[Speaker 2] (51:23 - 51:24)
Chairman, this is Patrick Murphy. Yes, sir.

[Speaker 3] (51:25 - 51:26)
Okay. All right. All right.

[Speaker 2] (51:27 - 51:29)
That was in response. I'm sorry. Go ahead.

[Speaker 3] (51:29 - 51:56)
Well, I mean, both all the departments in our mayor's office to, you know, really did a fine presentation. And I know we chairman Osterman and I spent a lot of time on this earlier in the summer. So some of that might be a refresher course for some of us in the Q and a, but thanks to all the department heads and the mayor's office for their presentation to date.

Alderman Kappelman.

[Speaker 23] (51:56 - 52:45)
Thank you so much chairman. Given this crisis we're experiencing with affordable housing, I'm delighted. This is finally being heard.

My very first apartment in 1972 was a coach house. Very inexpensive. And I was going to school.

So it really helped me while I continue to advocate to provide as few restrictions as possible because research around the country shows that it, it ends up producing more affordable units. This substitute ordinance is, is certainly a start. So my, I have two questions for commissioner Navarro.

My first one is as we approach the end of this ADU pilot project, what will be some of the factors used to assess how well it worked?

[Speaker 1] (52:49 - 55:19)
Thank you for the question Alderman. You know, I think there's many things that we're looking at. We are looking at, and some of these came up during the public comment.

We're looking at how accessible does this program seem to be to the average homeowner, the average property owner? Are we doing a good job reaching people with our, our, our, some of this is a, is a reflection upon us as a city department and and also our partners and NHS mentioned that they'll be working on with us on the same thing. So how are we doing at getting the word out to people and making this as simple and accessible process as possible?

How are we doing on an equitable distribution of the Chicago low-income housing trust funds across the different pilot areas? How are we doing on making sure that we're getting grant dollars to low-income homeowners to convert their existing units that they have? And what are the, generally speaking, what are the numbers that we're seeing and what can we learn from that?

Are we seeing a huge uptick in some pilots and very little in others? And what can we learn about why that's the case? And if there's a, if there's a barrier there that we need to address, or if there's simply just less neighborhood interest in some parts of the city or the other, I mean, I think what we heard loud and clear from our subject matter hearing in the summer was that we shared a lot of data about how these programs rolled out and what the uptake was in other cities.

But what we heard loud and clear was people wanted to understand how this was going to work here in Chicago. So we want to be able to provide that information, right? When we provide this and we'll have some areas where there's no restriction on the number and we'll see what comes of that.

And there's other areas where we are noting a smaller amount that can be rolled out in any given block and we'll see how that works. And so those are the things that we want to come back on. And I do want to stress just one more time that it isn't that we're going to go away and not report back to council on this for three years.

We will be every quarter as we report to the committee on housing and real estate, noting exactly our measures on all of those things. What happens in three years is us giving, you know, an overall look at those reflections and seeing what they teach us about our path forward and making those recommendations. Thank you.

[Speaker 23] (55:19 - 56:03)
And your response kind of dovetails into my next question because I realized, you know, some of my colleagues believe the best way to obtain accurate feedback is really by relying on Chicago data rather than data used across the country. So as we review this pilot project, will the gathering of data allow us to ascertain whether or not there were any similarities in Chicago with data obtained across the country? And I ask because if the similarities are really close, it would make it easier to modify this ordinance using data from across the country rather than keep going back and doing more pilot projects in Chicago because, you know, time is of the essence with our affordable housing crisis.

[Speaker 1] (56:05 - 56:43)
Sure. And, you know, that's why we're grateful for partners like the Urban Land Institute, which is a national organization. And they did a ton of very detailed work here in Chicago, but we can look to them as we're learning as how these lessons have learned other places, our policy director as well, Daniel Hertz has been very involved with leaders in other city governments who have rolled this out.

And so we'll be in close touch over this whole period to see, you know, given if we get, if we get a certain output, how have other cities dealt with that or adjusted for that when they adapted the program?

[Speaker 23] (56:43 - 56:51)
Thank you so much, commissioner. This has my full support, a thousand percent. Thank you so much.

[Speaker 3] (56:51 - 57:05)
Thank you, Alderman Kappelman. And just because we might have a lot of speakers, I might ask to ask around too, if necessary. But we've got Alderman La Spada, Daniel.

[Speaker 13] (57:06 - 58:20)
Thank you, chairman. I have to say, like I'm really glad that we've come around to this ordinance that we're voting on it today. I know it's the result of a lot of hard work.

So my, my thanks really goes out to Patrick Murphy, commissioner Navarro, Daniel Hertz. Thank you so much for bringing this opportunity to the city overall. We've heard a lot of positive feedback.

We've had residents confirm that being able to add an ADU is going to be one of their best opportunities for holding onto their home and keeping it affordable. I would add, I heard Mr. Paul Colgan speak earlier about the exclusion of the 606 area. It's not entirely true.

Actually the majority of the area around the 606 that falls in the first ward is going to be open to ADUs. And we're really looking forward to that. I'm going to bring three quick questions that I've heard from constituents that feedback would be helpful on.

One is we had folks, a voice of concern around with coach houses in particular. Do we feel like those will be accessible to the fire department as needs be? I know we've heard that concern before.

Is there a response on that?

[Speaker 2] (58:22 - 58:55)
Alderman, this is Patrick Murphy. I can answer some of that and I believe Grant Ulrich from buildings is on as well. So we were very deliberate in how we would allow for a coach house, a new coach house to be established mid block or not on a public right of way.

So if you're not the building on the corner, you would have to keep that coach house structure three feet away from the other interior lot line so that there would be access on one side of the building to the second floor.

[Speaker 13] (58:58 - 59:02)
And Patrick, that should be sufficient for fire department access?

[Speaker 2] (59:02 - 59:04)
That was what they specifically asked for.

[Speaker 13] (59:05 - 59:05)
Okay.

[Speaker 2] (59:05 - 59:13)
And we did not put in an ability to seek relief from that setback requirement, that separation requirement.

[Speaker 13] (59:14 - 59:51)
Really helpful to understand. The second question that was brought to me was related to the 22nd foot height limit for coach houses. There was concern brought to my office whether this could potentially impact light access for residents of the primary building, whether it could create some kind of a Canyon effect in the alley.

Well, while I don't think we're going to see that quick of a proliferation of coach houses to see that impact. I'm wondering if you can speak to that potential impact and how we landed at the 22 foot limit.

[Speaker 2] (59:54 - 1:02:13)
So currently we have a 15 foot cap that is allowed for accessory structures in the rear of the property. There can be relief to that. People add on to accessory buildings to make them taller for a whole host of open air and enclosed uses short of allowing it for dwelling purposes.

We that we also looked at what is required from a vehicular access standpoint to give the clearance to reestablish a car, you know, a garage for cars because in a lot of cases, an existing accessory structure would be insufficient to support a coach house above it, both from a fire protection and a structural, the physical weight standpoint, as well as access with the stairs. So presuming that you're building a new garage to house the vehicles and then you add the coach house on top of it, we didn't want to be in a position of having insufficient space for height clearance for the residential portion of the unit. So we looked at a whole host of other major cities throughout the country and our 22 feet falls right about in the middle.

Everyone ranged from in the low, like around 20 feet up to about 24, 25 feet. And we balanced that with also having to realize that there are an enormous amount of utility lines that run at an elevated nature up and down alleys. And so the ability to have, we didn't, we didn't want to allow for it to be too tall to openly encourage excessive outdoor areas that could be in conflict with those power lines.

So we tried to strike a balance as far as acknowledging that people today can build taller structures in the rear balance with what is going on elsewhere in the country and keeping in mind, trying to establish something that is safe for individuals to occupy. As far as a Canyon effect across an alley, you're, I mean, in a, in a generally speaking in a residential, a single family home area, you're dealing with a 16 to 20 foot alley. You're then dealing with 25 to 30 feet from the rear of the property line to the rear of the primary structure, if not more.

And so we did not feel that this height was excessive given those types of separations. Now you can also establish coach houses in other zoning districts that allow more than single family homes. So you're already going to be dealing with principal structures that are significantly taller, or you could be dealing with principal structures that are significantly taller than 22 feet.

[Speaker 13] (1:02:14 - 1:02:39)
I appreciate that, sir. I assume there was a strong rationale and there definitely was my last question would be, we have heard feedback about B and C zoning. And while I understand that this is primary in our first pilot, a residential program for residentially zoned lots, what is the analysis that the city would need to see to start opening this up to B and C zoning?

[Speaker 3] (1:02:43 - 1:02:58)
Well, Oh, go ahead. I think you're on, on the line, but I'm going to tell both Patrick and whatever. Let's keep our questions, our answers a little bit more succinct and shorter.

Okay. Nevermind. But that's, that's up to the Alderman.

I'll leave that one to him.

[Speaker 2] (1:02:59 - 1:03:49)
Okay. All right. I will be succinct in saying that when we talked earlier this summer, we have a number of reasons as to why we did not extend this to business and commercial districts.

One is because there are already a lesser minimum lot area standards in business and commercial districts that could allow for greater density than what you can get in some of our lower density residential districts. Secondly, only the B2 classification allows for dwelling units to be established by right on the ground floor. So basement units, coach houses without parking, you would, you'd be running into significant zoning obstacles in every district other than a B2.

And then thirdly, we already have zoning designations that allow for greater density to be added in B and C districts through our transit serve location ordinance. So collectively we thought that was a good reason to focus on the residential districts to start.

[Speaker 13] (1:03:49 - 1:04:24)
I appreciate that, sir. I will say, I'm glad to be voting in favor of this today. I'm, I know it's a first step.

I, I'm honestly looking forward to seeing the grant program that we're bringing out. I'm looking forward to you along the way, making TOD eligibility for coach houses and ADU's possibility to kind of reduce some of the accessory parking requirement as we have for other developers. But this is a really strong first start.

And I know it's a part of the solution we need for affordable housing. So thank you again for everyone's work. Thank you, chairman.

[Speaker 3] (1:04:24 - 1:04:38)
Thank you, Daniel. All right. Alderman Siccio-Lopez.

And I'm not going to put the clock on, but I'm getting ready. For at least round one. So Byron, let's hear from Byron Siccio-Lopez.

[Speaker 15] (1:04:39 - 1:06:22)
Thank you, chairman. And I won't take too long. I promise.

So in terms of I'm going to start to cover some of the questions that I had. And my question is actually in terms of the affordability. I know that we talked about, you know, some of these units are organically affordable and the hope is to preserve affordability.

We're really interested. I think we've had a great conversation with the housing department about, you know, we, we wanted to, to see how we can participate of the pilot, but we have a lot of variables here in Pilsen, as you know. So the, the affordability component is key and we just need a little bit more time.

You know, we needed more time to socialize it. And we had unfortunately other topics that took precedent and it was hard to get the, the ADU, you know, to socialize. But in the future, you know, if there is opportunity to add pilots, my question is, is it possible to add pilots?

We had a good conversation about some of the challenges that we have in areas like Pilsen. But then I see that there is opportunity. I see these, I feel cautiously optimistic about this.

I think there's a lot of data to look into it, but how do we, how do we, I mean, in terms of community buying, that's one of the questions that we get. How do we ensure that these can remain, you know, affordable? We've done this with zoning in terms of governance and other ways.

Is there something in these lines, something that we can discuss because I think there's interest on the pilot, but there's some, maybe some things that we can be adding in terms of guaranteeing the preservation of affordability with these dwelling units.

[Speaker 1] (1:06:26 - 1:06:44)
Alderman, I heard a fair number of questions in there. So I just want to try to confirm what you're asking. I heard what's a community process.

I heard how are we guaranteeing affordability? I heard new additions to the pilot. Am I?

Yeah.

[Speaker 15] (1:06:44 - 1:07:36)
So let's do it easier, right? So what is the process for us to, will they give me another round of pilots that we can get into, you know, other communities who want to get at it? One.

And two is that some of the things that we have heard, we started to socialize, you know, thanks to your department who came and spoke with our stakeholders about some of these possibilities or pilots, we just need a little bit more time. But one of the questions that is a recurring question is that a concern about how we can preserve the affordability. Some homeowners believe that these may impact some of the property taxes or there may be extra costs that may not be able for them to guarantee the affordability, the dwelling units to be affordable.

So how do we able to, you know, address that concern and if there's around two for pilots, those are the two questions.

[Speaker 1] (1:07:37 - 1:09:56)
Okay. So one thing to, to the concerns that you're hearing from homeowners who have fears about the costs of, of creating one or rehabilitating an existing unit that they may have may have created without permitting it. We do have a grant that we have set aside in the 2021 budget of over a million dollars to assist low and moderate income homeowners to convert existing units into, you know, approved ADUs and when we're very sensitive to that, we know that in many cases because the city made it so difficult for so many years, people found kind of went around the system and created them.

We're now we're trying to make it easy for people to now make them permitted, make them safe and come into compliance. And we want to especially help low income homeowners with that process. We also know that Pilsen is one of the areas that is a target area for expansion of the Chicago low income housing trust fund.

On top of that, we have, we have subsidies set aside for ADUs. So between the two, I think we've got a great opportunity to make sure that folks that are creating new accessory dwelling units are doing so with a trust fund voucher. Which will require them though, to have a tenant who is at 30% of the area median income or below.

So I think those are some things that we can be really purposeful in working with all their manic offices and community organizations to make sure we're pairing those resources and make sure that we're reaching a range of incomes with these, with these units. To your question about expanding the pilots, as I've said, we were not planning to kind of like burrow into a tunnel for three years and come back. I think if something that, you know, as we're reporting on this quarterly, if we come back in a year and there's an interest in a range of places of saying, okay, I wasn't ready to try this out.

You know, when this began or maybe this part of the city wasn't prioritized when we began, but we want to, we really want to try this out and make a case for it. Then I think that's a conversation that we're open to having.

[Speaker 15] (1:09:57 - 1:10:00)
Thank you. That's it. Thank you, commissioner.

[Speaker 3] (1:10:00 - 1:10:21)
Thank you Alderman. And as you know, as you've been doing without the AD ordinance, just because you're not in the pilot area, you can still do what you're doing already in your community. So that might be good evidence to know that, Hey, we're ready to do this on a expanded pilot.

So, all right, Matt Martin, Alderman Martin.

[Speaker 22] (1:10:22 - 1:12:14)
Thanks very much, chairman. I appreciate it. I'll be voting in support of this and very excited to do so.

I think the very first conversation I had with Steve Valenciano in June, if memory serves of 2019 was about this specific issue. And so it's taken a little bit longer than I would have anticipated. But that's probably just chalked that up to being a newer person on city council, but am pleased with this final product.

I think that for one, it covers all of the 47th ward, which was really important to me. It has a number of affordability components that have also been discussed and also for the North side pilot and experiments with reducing some of the regulations that we know from other jurisdictions, particularly on the West coast have inhibited the sort of construction that at least in 47th ward, we're really looking to see because when I look at our housing stock, a lot of courtyard buildings, as well as two and three flat units, bringing ADUs on board is a way for us to maintain and expand affordability likely much beyond the ARO, which is something that gets discussed a lot, rightly so. But I think this in the 47th ward has the impact to be quite transformational.

So I'm looking forward to partnering with our community groups to make sure that we're spreading the word starting next month, that we have packages available to folks so that they can bring themselves up to speed as quickly as possible. But just wanted to end by sharing my sincere thanks to administrator Murphy, to Steve Valenciano, Commissioner Navarra and Patrick Murphy. This has been a long time coming and I'm really excited to see us on the cusp.

So thank you all. And thank you, chair.

[Speaker 3] (1:12:14 - 1:12:27)
Thank you, Alderman Martin, Alderman Vasquez. Thank you very much, chairman. And let's follow Alderman Martin's lead on that time limit.

[Speaker 18] (1:12:29 - 1:13:13)
I had a feeling you were going to say that. I got my home in the background, which is an ADU. So clearly I'm excited about the fact that this is actually moving forward.

I don't know if I'm one of the only city council members that live in an ADU, but I'm willing to take that. So thank you so much for this work and really for the changes that were made in order to get this seemingly over the finish line. And I do hope the colleagues here do support it.

I just had a couple of questions. I know you mentioned like the quarterly meetings and everything as far as regular reporting, not just in 2024, but are there plans for a specific engagement with the alders that are part of the pilot? Like, are they going to be regular meetings to kind of figure out how we can improve and get the word out?

What does that look like? Commissioner.

[Speaker 1] (1:13:16 - 1:13:55)
Thanks for the question. I think it's a really good one. I think it's something that we can work with all of you that are part of this to, to figure out what's the right cadence for that.

But I think it's a really important idea because you are going to be then giving us feedback that we need to hear about the problems people might be running into, the challenges, the things we didn't foresee. That's exactly the kind of feedback loop we need to set up. So what I can commit to you is that, you know, Daniel and I can follow up and we'll set up, you know, we're not actually rolling it out till the spring.

So we got a little time to set up our, our cadence there and figure out how that's going to work.

[Speaker 18] (1:13:55 - 1:13:58)
And Daniel lives on a 40th. So I'll be sure to knock on his door.

[Speaker 1] (1:13:59 - 1:14:01)
You can just go knock on his door. I'll stay out of it.

[Speaker 18] (1:14:01 - 1:14:19)
In a socially distanced manner. Yeah. My next question is, Oh, and this was mentioned by, by Paul during the public comment.

So is it not possible for like a coach house to be part of a new construction, even in the pilot areas?

[Speaker 2] (1:14:22 - 1:14:55)
No, in, in the pilots, you can, so that there are provisions specific to allowing, sorry, this is Patrick Murphy. There are provisions specific to allowing new coach houses. We have rules today that, that if they are not in a landmark district and weren't previously used for residential purposes, or if they haven't been used for residential purposes in over a year, they can't be reoccupied.

Those rules still stay in effect for the balance of the city, but within the pilots, you can reoccupy or build new under these specific bulk parameters, the height and the square footage, like we were talking. Okay.

[Speaker 18] (1:14:56 - 1:15:43)
Perfect. Love that. And then I get my last question.

See, keeping it brief, Karen working on it is as far as, you know, the, the public awareness. And as my colleague, Alderman Ciccio Lopez mentioned kind of the socialization of making sure that people who are, who have space to build are able to has, who's that like the point person for that? Or is there someone who talked to you because being an older of a pilot ward, I want to make sure that all the neighbors know that they can, you know, overcome whatever hurdles they may have or accessibility issues and understanding how to get everything set up.

How is that going to be handled once it's implemented and that's to either. Yeah. Commissioner or anyone.

[Speaker 1] (1:15:44 - 1:15:46)
Go ahead, Daniel. I can see you.

[Speaker 4] (1:15:48 - 1:16:36)
Thanks Alderman. I'd be happy to talk to you about that. I think we definitely recognize as a number of people have spoken to the need for this to be accompanied by a really robust outreach and education campaign that I think we see working obviously with ward offices really closely with our delegate agencies and community-based organizations that we've partnered with.

Many of them we've been having conversations about this ordinance with as well as with, you know, architects and contractors who may be working on this so they understand, you know, all of those sort of ins and outs of it. And some of the multifamily owners who own, you know, very tight buildings. So they're aware of it.

And, you know, we want this to be as you know, want to walk people through this as closely as we can to make sure that people are, you know, educated about it and can actually take advantage of these new regulations.

[Speaker 18] (1:16:37 - 1:16:45)
Awesome. So a quick follow-up, is there any, any budget towards any kind of like collateral or getting that information out?

[Speaker 1] (1:16:48 - 1:17:45)
Well, one thing I'll note Alderman is you heard from Sarah Bruni in the public comment with neighborhood housing services. They are a delegate agency of the city and we they have been working for quite some time on kind of a informational informational, I don't know, pamphlet. It's bigger than a pamphlet.

So I'm not quite sure what to call it. You know, with things like sample plans and really walking it through the process for people in a way that's accessible to, you know, the average person. And so I know that's something that they are working on.

And we will also, you know, we do, we can work with our in-house graphics folks to do that as well. So that's really, that's part of why we have a delay in implementation here is so that we can, once we hopefully, once it's hopefully passed and we know that it's moving forward, then we can kick into gear with the kinds of things that, that people will need.

[Speaker 18] (1:17:45 - 1:18:05)
Awesome. I would love to be any kind of help on that or any kind of feedback with my part marketing brain. Love to help.

So thank you so much for doing it again. I'm super related. I feel a different level of abiding by the law now in my new home.

So thank you all for that. Thank you for the work. And thank you, chairman.

[Speaker 3] (1:18:05 - 1:18:16)
Thank you. And now the Dean of our affordable housing council, Alderman chairman Burnett Walter.

[Speaker 21] (1:18:17 - 1:20:07)
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I just want to commend the commissioner. So happy to be a part of this.

You know, I actually live on a block that has two coach houses on my side of the street. And I'm going to tell you, it really makes your alleys feel so safe to have people walking back and forth to their homes, you know, and then when you're driving out of your garage, you see them, you speak, you talk all that good stuff. I mean, it really makes, it just brings a different type of neighborhood to a neighborhood.

So I think this is long overdue. And as I was saying earlier, you know, this is another way for Chicago to be able to increase the population in our city that we so desperately need with all of the people, all of the exodus from the city, this helps with the population, but it also helped with the affordability. And also it helps with making communities more mixed, right?

So I think this is great. It helps with parents to be able to keep your parents at home. It also helps to keep your young folks at home.

If they can't right out of college, they can't afford to get an expensive apartment right away. So I think this is a great thing. I commend all of you all that have been involved.

You guys have done a lot of work. I know I'm in a pilot. I wish more of my ward was in a pilot.

Daniel, actually I want my whole ward in it, man, because this is just so exciting. I know that my residents are excited about it. It's going to really help to bring population to the city of Chicago, but also more affordable housing to the city.

So thank you all very much. I commend everyone that's been involved. Good job.

Thank you.

[Speaker 3] (1:20:08 - 1:20:11)
Thank you, Alderman Burnett. Alderman Mike Rodriguez.

[Speaker 17] (1:20:13 - 1:22:47)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just wanted to thank the commissioner and Daniel for their work on this endeavor. I think Daniel knows my community leaders very well now through this process.

We've had several institutions that have been involved in helping vet this, this process. And we're, we're actually excited to be a part of this test phase because we're going to test it out as well as a community. There's one element that hasn't been brought up, and I literally believe this effort may save lives.

We've seen in our community a number of illegal conversions that have led to some very drastic outcomes, fires and, and, and unfortunate tragedies in our community. And I think that having this available to folks, having the financial assistance to low and moderate income individuals to help legalize these units, I think is potentially a game changer and a lifesaver. You know, our community certainly has questions and we, we have to further socialize this because it's been a grass tops effort so far.

And I, I gotta, we gotta make sure to get to the grassroots, but you know, over the next couple of months, we're going to be doing that and in partnership with you to make sure that we have a buy-in because to be quite frank, in order for us to leverage this to the best extent possible, we're going to have to have as much outreach as possible and much engagement. You know, we've had some challenges with Spanish language access. I want my staff to be well-trained and helping walk people through this application process.

I think one of the testimonies was, was true. I mean, is this going to be a boondoggle essentially for lawyers to help, you know, in that respect? And, and, you know, I want, I want to make sure folks have the resources available to them to be able to navigate this process.

Because to be quite honest, most of the time when my people in my community don't navigate these processes because of the things I just mentioned. And the last thing I'd say is we very much welcome the opportunity to maintain affordability in our community and increase affordability in our community. So I'll be brief chairman and just say, thank you for your efforts, commissioner and department.

And I look forward to working with you and carrying this out.

[Speaker 3] (1:22:48 - 1:22:50)
Thank you, Alderman. Alderman Raymond Lopez.

[Speaker 6] (1:22:53 - 1:24:15)
Thank you, chairman. Actually, I wanted to follow up with what Alderman Rodriguez just mentioned, because it was one of the concerns that I have too. And commissioner or buildings, whomever the issue of illegal conversions in the part that was in one of the slides that was brought up that showed the additional dwelling unit typologies.

You have both basement conversion as well as attic conversions, correct? Would become permissible under this pilot program. That is my I'm correct.

Yes. Yes, sir. Thank you, Patrick.

Now for those two in particular, those are very much illegal conversions throughout many of the neighborhoods throughout the city of Chicago. One entrance in, if you're lucky, to the attic or to the basement with families living dangerous situations. How does this ordinance make those units any safer by allowing them in the communities other than by simply recognizing them as something that a person can rent to without getting fined for being in a legal conversion, illegally converted apartment.

[Speaker 2] (1:24:17 - 1:25:16)
Well, Alderman, this is Patrick. I could, I could start by just giving some of the zoning aspect to it and I could turn it over to a commissioner boday or grant if they want to add more from buildings, but this is going to be a very this will be a way that we can spotlight where these units are at so that once they start the process to legalize themselves from a zoning standpoint and this, and I would say, honestly, this is aside from the fact of whether there's an affordability component, because as someone mentioned earlier, I think chairman Tunney, someone could still seek a zoning map amendment and add a unit. This would then start that process to spotlight that particular unit and then move them on to the department of buildings to actually have the site inspected and legalized from a life safety standpoint.

So, so this, this is a matter of starting the process and having a way to bring attention to those units and also giving them a path forward to get the units legalized both from a zoning standpoint and from a life safety standpoint.

[Speaker 6] (1:25:18 - 1:25:29)
Thank you, Patrick. So then perhaps buildings can answer, how does this ordinance make that single entry unit, whether it's legal or otherwise safe.

[Speaker 5] (1:25:31 - 1:25:39)
Good afternoon, Alderman. This is Grant Ulrich managing deputy commissioner from the department of buildings still have the headset. I know you like the headset.

[Speaker 6] (1:25:41 - 1:25:43)
Take a little fry when you're finished. Thank you.

[Speaker 5] (1:25:45 - 1:27:19)
Next window. So the question is about life safety, which is very important to all of us. And we know that these illegal conversions are out there and some illegal coach houses are out there because it has been difficult or impossible in large areas of the city.

So this is a first step in terms of the pilot zones, in terms of creating a path. And when there is a path, there is an opportunity for us to both at the plan stage, if it's a new unit address those issues, because under the building code, there are ways to have single exit units, smaller units are only required to have a single exit. But there's a number of life safety measures in terms of windows for natural light and ventilation and ceiling height and separation from other units in the building or from a heating equipment, all of which get taken into account in a legally permitted unit.

And we look at that and we apply those uniform standards of the building code to that to establish that minimum level of life safety. And for illegal units, they avoid that process and often they do things that are unsafe, whether it's a dangerous electrical wiring, a unit that's too big to have a single exit or, or doesn't have the appropriate ventilation systems, doesn't have appropriate windows or other conditions that when we are able to bring them in through the building process, we are able to work with the builder and the owner to address.

[Speaker 4] (1:27:21 - 1:27:37)
And this is Daniel Arts from DOH. I would also just add that I think the provision of the low and moderate in home homeowner grant program is also a meaningful incentive and writing resources for homeowners to make those life safety improvements.

[Speaker 6] (1:27:41 - 1:28:43)
Okay. So I guess my concern is that as somebody who's ward on the Southwest side is loaded with two and three flat small unit buildings, which many of you heard me as commissioner, you've heard me speak about repeatedly with other items that have come out from this department. We are now looking at the possibility of individuals basically taking these basement apartments, these attic apartments and trying to convert and basically say that, well, if we're in this pilot zone, which thankfully we're not but you know, for people who are in pilot zones that they could say, well, now we're going to make them an ADU unit and everything's going to be fine and dandy now.

So what safeguards do you have to ensure that people's safety will not be imperiled by, by what's, what will possibly be the manipulation of what you're proposing as a way of just kind of skirting the law to say, now we have free reign to have our legal conversions rented to the help.

[Speaker 5] (1:28:45 - 1:29:42)
So I think I would speak to the experience. The department of buildings has a lot of experience for the buildings that have gone through the existing more complex process to legalize a unit. Just getting the zoning approval is step one of a multi-step process.

And often if a unit was built without permits, there are problems behind the walls. And as part of our permitting process, we do make them open up probably not all the walls, but we make them open up a sample of the walls to see the electrical to see plumbing, if it's hidden in the walls to make sure that it meets code. And we don't let it meet the code for whenever it was illegally built five years ago, 10 years ago, 20 years ago, it has to meet the current codes.

If you were building that unit new to be fair to anyone else who's going through the process the right way. So there are upgrades they're going to have to make through our process either in the plan stage or the inspection stage to meet the code.

[Speaker 6] (1:29:43 - 1:30:56)
So grant. I understand this as a pilot. Don't get me wrong.

I'm just trying to figure out, you know, it would seem to me that particularly with, with the money being set aside to help get some of these units into compliance, $30,000 would be eaten up pretty fast, Especially if we're talking about switching out electrical plumbing and many of those other items that oftentimes are, are shortcutted to make livability in some of these units, wouldn't it make more sense.

And I'm throwing this out there as a completely hypothetical to say in those zones, in those pilot zones, why don't we just offer straight out building amnesty for inspectors to come in so that you could actually go in as a building department, as the housing department and say, look, we look, we're looking at your basement. We're looking at your attic. We're looking at all the other options as well.

You know, with no fault, here's what you could do. If you want to come into this program and here's how long you have to do to get it right, or to make it go away. Wouldn't that be easier than doing, putting, doing it like manner that we're proposing today.

[Speaker 5] (1:30:57 - 1:32:01)
So, so we do, I think, have a provision like that in the code today, but it has to have existed for 50 years. Well, so it's a pretty hard standard to meet in the first draft of this ordinance. It did reduce that value.

But when it was pulled back from a citywide ordinance to a pilot zone ordinance, that piece was taken out alderman. So in the pilot zones, the path is going to be to use the ADU ordinance. I think that there's definitely other paths to explore that.

I know Patrick's on and can weigh in on that, but buildings would very much like to see a path for these units that exist that have existed for some time to legalize them. So we can get in there and address those safety issues without the current situation where someone realizes that there is no zoning path or, or the zoning path requires a zoning change for the property to, to bring the unit into compliance, which many owners just can't afford or accomplish.

[Speaker 3] (1:32:02 - 1:32:07)
All right. Thank you, chairman Lopez. Thank you.

Alderman Roboyes.

[Speaker 24] (1:32:10 - 1:32:23)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First of all, I want to thank everyone that's been involved in this. Wait, did you, did you mute me again?

Can you guys hear me? We can hear you loud and clear.

[Speaker 26] (1:32:24 - 1:32:24)
I'm sorry.

[Speaker 24] (1:32:24 - 1:32:59)
I was talking to myself. Time's up. I want to, I want to thank chairman Osterman, chairman Tunney, commissioner Novarro, commissioner Bodine, and our zoning administrator, Patrick Murphy for all this work that you guys have done much like my distinguished colleague from the 15th ward just stated.

I'm not in, I'm not in the, in the, in the zone for, for the, for the pilot. I thought I heard someone say that because we're not in the zone, we can still do this. Is that correct?

[Speaker 3] (1:33:00 - 1:33:07)
Yes. Yes. Alderman.

It's being done well before this ADU ordinance was passed. It requires a zoning change.

[Speaker 24] (1:33:07 - 1:33:37)
Okay. And my question, I got a couple, my couple of questions that I have is how about existing homes or two flats that currently have pending cases due to an ADU apartment without the proper permitting? How is that going to be addressed?

And will the city continue to give citations out to anyone that fits this category?

[Speaker 3] (1:33:37 - 1:33:40)
Patrick Murphy, would you answer the question please on that one?

[Speaker 2] (1:33:40 - 1:34:35)
Sure. So Alderman much, this is Patrick Murphy with department of planning, much like any other violations that exist or permits that have been, I should say, and said permits that have been applied for before an ordinance is enacted, someone can proceed under that former permit. And like Alderman Tunney said, if they were in with a permit to convert or establish an additional unit within their building prior to this ordinance, they would have to either be doing it under the current zoning they have.

So it would be allowed maybe with some relief from the ZBA, but allowed by right, or it would be going to the committee on zoning to seek a zoning map amendment to afford them the development rights to add the unit. So people are doing this today and they could continue to do that in or out of the pilots, but this is just an avenue that would give a, it would allow them to proceed without a zoning map amendment. But if someone has already started, if they're already in for permits to do this work, they wouldn't, this would not apply to them.

[Speaker 24] (1:34:36 - 1:35:03)
There are many ADUs in the city of Chicago in every ward. And most of them I'm going to say have not done the legal process, permitting process. And a lot of them, in fact, probably most of them have purchased these homes in that state.

Some of which have pending cases. How will they be addressed?

[Speaker 5] (1:35:04 - 1:36:05)
So Alderman, this is Grant Ulrich again from the Department of Buildings. Outside the pilot areas, we're going to continue to enforce, and the Department of Buildings does both zoning and building code enforcement. If we get a complaint about a unit that is there that is in violation of the zoning ordinance and has been built without permits, we're going to, you know, start an enforcement action against them.

We're going to work with them to try and find a way to make it safe if that's what the owner wants to do, but there are still going to be barriers in the zoning ordinance, especially outside these pilot areas to bringing them into legal conformance without the steps that Patrick and others have spoken to in terms of an individual zoning change or going to the Zoning Board of Appeals. And if they're in the pilot area? In the pilot area, it's going to become much easier to bring an existing unit into conformance, but it's going to have to meet the same standards as if you were building it new.

[Speaker 24] (1:36:10 - 1:36:12)
So the city is going to continue to do in citations.

[Speaker 5] (1:36:14 - 1:36:18)
We are going to continue to enforce the zoning ordinances as written by the council. Yes.

[Speaker 3] (1:36:19 - 1:36:27)
All right. Thank you. Thank you, Alderman.

Alderman Carlos Ramirez Rosa. Carlos.

[Speaker 10] (1:36:29 - 1:37:06)
Thank you so much, Chairman Tunney. And thank you so much Chairman Osterman and to the housing committee staff, Commissioner Varo, our policy director, Daniel K Hertz, as well as our zoning administrator and DPD. I have one question.

And that is, it's relating to how would the city will track if ADUs are being put on the books, are totally new construction or are existing illegal units that are being legalized? So are there plans for that to be tracked and how will it be tracked?

[Speaker 2] (1:37:08 - 1:37:30)
Alderman, this is Patrick Murphy. I, sorry about this camera. I would, I would say, first of all, if it's a new unit, then because of the provision that we have in the ordinance, it cannot qualify.

I'm sorry. If it's a new building, it cannot qualify into this ordinance. The building has to be at least 20 years old.

So someone could, I understand that.

[Speaker 10] (1:37:30 - 1:37:44)
I mean, if it's just a new, totally all new ADU, they're totally building out the attic for the first time, as opposed to they have an illegal attic conversion right now. Will that be tracked by the city?

[Speaker 2] (1:37:47 - 1:38:00)
I guess I'll answer it in two ways. It can happen outside of the pilots as we talked about, but inside the pilots, yes, there is a specific tracking and monitoring that will take place at And that's something that commissioner Navarro was speaking to that will be reported back. Yes, sir.

[Speaker 10] (1:38:01 - 1:40:21)
Excellent. Thank you. I really appreciate that clarification.

I think that data is going to be really important as it will really help us determine the true impact of this policy and how it should be expanded and understood. Well, I want to say this ordinance will impact 80% of my ward and I'm wholeheartedly in support. I wish it included all of my ward.

In 2017, in conjunction with community groups, we amended our local 35th ward community driven zoning and development process to make it easier to legalize certain basement and attic apartments. Since then, I have heard from so many 35th ward residents who are seeking to build ADUs to provide housing for neighbors and our help them came up with housing expenses and rising property taxes. I support the substitute ordinance because it represents the community input I've received over many years in support of ADUs and because it will help 35th ward residents stay in their homes while providing needed housing within our ward's existing envelope.

I also support this ordinance because it will help preserve our world's historic buildings and encourage environmentally sustainable building practices by requiring that buildings be at least 20 years old in order to qualify for an interior ADU. The ordinance will also help address displacement by requiring that 50% of new ADUs must be affordable for 30 years when two or more ADUs are added to a building. I'm so pleased to see provisions that will help establish a program to help low and moderate income families build out an ADU.

And I'm so pleased that this ordinance will disallow ADUs from becoming Airbnbs or short-term vacation rentals, which is so critical to ensure these units become housing for our neighbors. So I'm really thankful to everyone who worked on this to you, Patrick, Daniel, Commissioner Navarro, and thank you for taking the time to speak to me and accepting input from myself and my community on this ordinance. As noted earlier, while I had asked for and pushed for the entirety of the 35th board to be included in the Northwest zone, after speaking with the department of housing, I understand why the boundaries had to be drawn in such a way that resulted with most 80%, but not all the words inclusion in the zone.

So I'm hopeful as discussed by many that passage of this substitute ordinance will pave the way for eventual expansion of the ordinances, important ADU provisions to the entirety of the 35th board and the city of Chicago. So I hope this passes the committee today and we can see this at work soon in the 35th ward.

[Speaker 3] (1:40:22 - 1:40:25)
Thank you. Thank you, Alderman Ramirez-Rosa. Alderman Marie Hadden.

[Speaker 7] (1:40:26 - 1:42:05)
Thank you, chair. And hello everybody. Just a couple of clarifying questions again.

So one on this pilot, as we look at the different requirements for, you know, North and Northwest and South and Southwest, what are, what are we anticipating seeing, right? As benefits, as we think about, Hey, you know, kind of the ADU pilots going to help people more affordably add more housing. Hey, we could be adding more affordable housing.

You know, I hear great, great things from my colleagues about, you know, how we can kind of normalize this, how we can bring things kind of into compliance, but with the different feedback and the different concerns, what do we anticipate in the best case scenario of seeing coming out of these kind of different requirements? I don't know if that makes sense, but like, Hey, there are different requirements here. What do you, what do we hope to see coming out of these zones?

Cause it makes me, it makes me nervous to have different requirements on different geographies. I guess I'll state my concern, knowing that we're in a deeply segregated city that has a history of different requirements for different areas. And also knowing that, you know, where we started with this and a lot of the pushback from colleagues in different areas who, you know, I think are being pretty exclusionary.

So, you know, this, this seems, people seem happy with this who are in the pilot. So tell me why they're happy with these differences.

[Speaker 1] (1:42:05 - 1:44:38)
I can, I can start with that older woman. I mentioned earlier that one example that I gave for the difference in, for instance, saying that in, in Southwest and Southeast sides, the, if, if the building is three units or less, it has to be owner occupied. The reason for that was feedback that we had saying in, in many of these communities, there was a concern already at the level of investor ownership in buildings that leaders would really prefer be owner occupied, but that they didn't have one didn't have a chance to compete with purchasing with someone who's got cash to put down on a building.

But that if they, the investor was then knowing, oh, and I can throw in a basement or I can, you know, build a coach house and now that we're making it even more of an incentive for an investor to play in a market that they really want to be more owner occupant. And because of that concern, we talked through ways, well, how could we make this a benefit for community and for your community and not a negative for your community? What if we said, you know, do you, I assume you do not have a concern about an owner occupant adding a basement unit.

No, I don't. Okay. Then let's try and see if we focus it on that.

If what, what outcome we see. And then in the converse, we're really interested in seeing in the neighborhoods where that restriction is not in place. How much do we see of owner occupants taking advantage of this versus investors?

Cause this was an area of big speculation in the subject matter hearing that we had, right? Part of the conversation was, Hey, if this is not something that appeals to people in a neighborhood, they won't do it. It is not a, it is simply enabling legislation, right?

It says that you can now do this much more easily. And if that's not a fit for a block or a given home, then they won't do it. Yet what we heard was yes, but there are some investors who may force this upon a block.

And so what we really want to see is as we look at this, well, how much of that do we see when we look at the places where we don't distinguish what is the outcome and what did that mean for a block? And I think we'll be in a much better position after we've been able to observe those trends to be able to talk about the actual reality of what we would anticipate if this became, you know, a citywide effort.

[Speaker 7] (1:44:39 - 1:45:14)
Well, thank you for that. And I guess maybe to summarize then just for the record, some of the extra protections or requirements in the South and Southwest side zones are really focused on preserving locally owned properties and looking to protect the market. You would say that a way to summarize that like for residents who kind of live there and maybe providing some protections against opening up a market to outside investors.

[Speaker 1] (1:45:15 - 1:45:28)
Trying to ensure that this measure does not make it even more attractive. For a higher number of investors to be active in a community in which the leadership feels it's already too active.

[Speaker 7] (1:45:28 - 1:46:51)
Thank you for that. I guess the second piece is, I am happy for all of my colleagues who are included in pilot zones, but you know, 49th ward is not. And I do, you know, as a, as a ward that's 70% renter.

I know that there are reasons based on the zones and things around that. But, you know, want to encourage maybe can we not, I know we don't have to wait till the end of this pilot to get feedback and to work on things as you stated. But also thinking about some of the biggest opportunities in the 49th ward and I'm sure other neighborhoods in the city that are more like us to look at how we can use ADUs as well.

So I know that, you know, we've had a couple one-off opportunities here to take vacant commercial space and to convert that. That's where more of the opportunities are here to create more housing and affordable housing in that sense. So I look forward to continuing to work with your department commissioner and with our department of zoning development and planning to, to kind of work on solving those issues in communities that, that aren't included in the pilot.

So appreciate everybody's hard work on this. Thank you.

[Speaker 3] (1:46:51 - 1:46:57)
Thank you, Alderwoman. Alderman, Alderwoman Pat Dowell. Chairman Dowell.

[Speaker 25] (1:46:57 - 1:48:20)
Yes. Thank you, chairman. I just wanted to also go on the record here.

When this was first announced, I was not very happy with the original ordinance. I thought it was, you know, very broad and overreaching, you know, one size fits all. And as someone who knows that that's not the case in Chicago, I'm very thankful to the commissioner and to Daniel Hertz and Pat Murphy and to both of our chairman for working with the council and Alderman to craft an ordinance that I think now provides a way of testing whether or not the ADUs are going to be something that communities want and simplifying the requirement for each respective community. I think the addition of the grant program is a really thoughtful ad because there are going to be families out there that are going to need the extra help.

And I just wanted to say that I support the substitute ordinance and look forward to its passage and to implementing this in 2021. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 3] (1:48:21 - 1:48:35)
Thank you, Chairwoman Dowell. And I know for the record that we have Alderman Sophia King on. Our last speaker on this item before I'll ask Chairman Osterman to close will be Alderman David Moore.

[Speaker 20] (1:48:36 - 1:50:49)
Thank you so much, Chairman. This would be real kind of short because Chairman Dowell just said the things that I was going to say and Marisa and team, thank you all so much for your commitment to listening and communicating. I just wanted to add in as a sort of a small piggyback on what Alderman Raymond Lopez brought up, because I am a product of this.

We got an opportunity to move out of the projects to Chicago because my uncle and my aunt owned a two flat and my great aunt lived on the first floor and they converted a basement apartment into a three bedroom house for our family. And that's when I believe that not because my uncle was an assistant precinct captain when I got introduced to politics. And so that me giving that opportunity to get out of Robert Taylor at the time and then come and live in a community that was well kept like Inglewood at the time gave us that opportunity.

But I say it's important that we listen to Alderman Raymond Lopez on this issue because we often were concerned about if we ever got caught in a fire because we did not have that second escape, really. My aunt, because she lived upstairs, we were able to use her backstairs if something like that happened and go through her apartment. But everybody may not have that benefit.

And because my mom was disabled, those long stairs she was going to have to climb and the windows were kind of short. I can easily get out of them at a young age back then, but I'll be hard pressed to even climb through it now. But my point is, is that it's a good opportunity.

But I want us to really think about making sure that we have some type of regress, because if something does happen based on the conditions that we were living in, and thank God nothing ever happened, it would be challenging to have gotten out of that basement apartment. And I have to say that it would have. So although this is good because it gives people an opportunity, we really have to think about that and making sure they have that option to get out just in case of a fire or something like that.

So I just wanted to add that. Thank you. And thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 8] (1:50:50 - 1:52:09)
Thank you, Alderman Moore. To close, Chairman Osterman. Really brief.

Chairman Toney, I want to thank you for your leadership on this issue and for putting in a marathon day. I really look at this conversation we had today and the one we had in July and the collaboration of both committees with the administration and with Commissioner Navarro and her team, Daniel Hertz, Patrick Murphy, Steve Valenziano, Matt Bode, Grant Ulrich, and many others, those in the mayor's office. That's the spirit of collaboration that we need to address some of the big issues we have specifically with housing.

And I think on the issue of communication, we're going to carry that forward to all of you about how to implement this for your residents and also inform you about how this is working so that if you want to take advantage of this, you have the ability to do that in a streamlined way. I think the bottom line is we want to be, at this point next year, looking back and saying that we added units around the city of Chicago that were affordable and safe and really help communities and help families and help people. So I think I really appreciate the conversation and the collaboration and look forward to passage and would make a motion to approve the substitute ordinance that's before us.

[Speaker 3] (1:52:09 - 1:52:13)
Thank you. Thank you, Chairman Osterman.

[Speaker 6] (1:52:14 - 1:52:15)

[Speaker 3] (1:55:00 - 1:55:25)
We have 22 in the affirmative and one as a nay. So this ordinance passes and referred out of committees to the full city council. All right.

That being no further business by the committee, can I get a motion to adjourn by the same roll call that was applied to determine quorum?

[Speaker 25] (1:55:25 - 1:55:27)
Alderman Kappelman so moves.

[Speaker 3] (1:55:27 - 1:55:35)

[Speaker 3] (1:55:47 - 1:55:52)

No, that's fine. That's fine. Go ahead.

[Speaker 3] (1:55:55 - 1:56:10)
All right. So hearing no objection, this is ordered and the joint meeting of housing, real estate, zoning, landmarks, and building standards is adjourned. Everyone have a nice safe evening and we'll see you.

[Speaker 21] (1:56:11 - 1:56:13)
Thank you, everyone. Thank you.
