What are we saying. Okay. All right.

We do not have any public speakers signed up for today's hearing so we'll get right into things with document number 020231495, the historical landmark designation for the Clark Natch house located at 1700 North Hudson Avenue in the 32nd Ward we have Matt Crawford from the landmarks division of the Department of Planning and Development here to present the matter.

[Speaker 3] (6:55 - 7:05)
Matt. Thanks Chairman Tunney. Good morning.

I do have a presentation to share.

[Speaker 12] (7:24 - 9:17)
Proceed. Okay, thank you. Good morning record Matt Crawford planner with the Department of Planning and Development.

The Commission on Chicago landmarks is recommended to counsel that the Clark Natch house be designated as a Chicago landmark. The house is located in Old Town, and the owners of the house support and have requested this landmark designation. The landmarks Commission found that the house reflected the heritage of Old Town as an attractive neighborhood for Nate for Chicago creatives in the 20th century.

The Commission also found that the house is important for its association with Don Clark Natch who lived there with her husband Walter Natch. In 1973 she became the first woman to be elected to the Illinois Senate, and during her 18 years in office she advanced the equal rights amendment, the Family and Medical Leave Act and funding for HIV care. Her career is is distinguished by her good government credentials.

Commission also recommends the houses is a significant work of modern architecture. It was designed by architect Walter Natch as his home, and it reveals matches field theory of architecture in its expression of rotated squares on the design inside and out. Finally, the Commission recommends that the house is significant for its association with architect and first resident Walter Natch, a major Chicago architect during the modern movement in American architecture.

Noteworthy works by Natch are the Cadet Chapel at the US Air Force Academy, and his master plan and several buildings at the University of Illinois, Chicago. That concludes my presentation, happy to answer any questions you might have. Thank you.

[Speaker 22] (9:23 - 9:24)
Thanks, Matt.

[Speaker 1] (9:26 - 9:29)
I see Alderman Beals hand is up, Tony.

[Speaker 21] (9:31 - 9:36)
Yeah, Mr Chairman my hand is up for purpose of quorum and I move to pass.

[Speaker 1] (9:38 - 9:54)
All right, we thank you, Tony we have Alderman Mike Rodriguez hand up is that to be recognized for quorum I go. Yes, Mr. Thank you. All right, before we take a vote on it at the motion of Alderman Beal Alderman Hopkins I think wants to say a few words.

[Speaker 16] (9:55 - 10:58)
I do. Yeah, I'm just honored and privileged to be able to cast this vote today. I've actually been in this house, I worked for controller Natch for a period of time actually back when she was president.

She was Senator Natch. And then one memorable occasion. We signed her nominating petitions in her statement of candidacy when she ran for governor in 94 in the kitchen of that house.

And Walter Natch was just so proud of it he considered it one of his seminal accomplishments along with the others that were mentioned the UIC campus and the Cadet Chapel in Colorado. But his house was his love and his passion and clearly it qualifies for landmark status in every possible way. But it's it's history in Chicago, and its contribution to the politics of our city through his very accomplished wife Dawn will live on forever, and this is the right thing to do.

So I want to thank landmark staff for bringing this forward, and I very enthusiastically with very fond memories cast an eye vote on this. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (11:00 - 13:52)
Thank you, Alderman Hopkins. Any other comments, other than entertaining Alderman Beal's motion move to pass on this item. Alderman Beal makes the motion move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum, any objections to that.

Hearing no objections this item is passed. And I wanted to footnote, how proud I am to be the zoning chair, and a very close personal friend of Dawn that's to itself. It's a great day for Lincoln Old Town Lincoln Park community.

With that being said, we reported at the next city council meeting. All right. I did take a motion so there was no objections to the motion on Alderman Beal.

So the ordinance is passed. Next, large signs over 100 square feet in area 24 feet above grade. We'll hear them all together, I'll read the word followed by the address and take a motion at the end.

[Speaker 1] (13:55 - 14:41)
Gotcha. Walter Thank you. Now we have additional signs and staff correct me if I'm wrong, for the record, these were introduced improperly they were introduced improperly that's why we're taking them separately.

We have four signs over 100 square feet an area 24 feet above grade that requires substitutions, due to improper formatting. At this time I would ask for a motion to accept the four substitutes by the same role call that was used to determine form. All the boys makes the motion to accept the substitutes.

[Speaker 4] (16:03 - 17:39)
Thank you, Mr Chairman members of the committee Scott Borstein partner at the law firm of Neal and the Roy. So this is, there's a few we have a few of these today but this one in the third ward is a cleanup zoning correction matter for Chicago Public Schools. This is the Chicago Military Academy site on South Giles.

It's split zoning, and you've come before you multiple times when we have split zoning. One of the zones doesn't allow school uses. We like to rezone it get it all in an appropriate zoning district so there's no confusion regarding permitting.

And in this case to the building itself was non conforming as to its size, so we had to, you know, up zone to a higher zoning district so the bulk and density of the school building can be accommodated. So in this case we're going from the B one three and the RM five to the to an RM six. There's some work at the school.

But it's, you know, minor repair type work, but there's no changes to the school no changes to the parking. As I say it's just to correct the zoning and clean it up. I know Alderman Dowell is here.

We've talked to her multiple times as always we appreciate her help and guidance and support and so I'm sure she'll want to indicate her position on this. All right. Thank you, Scott, all the woman down.

[Speaker 19] (17:40 - 18:00)
Thank you, Mr Chairman and members of the committee. Thank you Scott for the work on this. It's a simple zoning amendment to make the split level zoning building conform and put it into one zoning category.

So I asked for the committee support on this matter. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (18:00 - 18:24)
Thank you. Any questions by committee members. Hearing on do I get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum Alderman Hopkins makes the motion move do pass any objections.

Hearing on the item is passed. Thank you on that one. Gil your hand up for purposes of quorum.

[Speaker 11] (18:25 - 18:27)
Yes, Chairman. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (18:27 - 19:05)
Okay, appreciate it. Now we're on the top page three document number two to 076 in the sixth ward, and also moving to the 17th the ordinance was referred on January 18 of 2023 common address is 7100 to 7118 South Paulston Street, and the change request from B one to neighborhood shopping district and see to to motor vehicle related commercial district, all to a C to to motor vehicle related commercial district. And we have Mr Pekarsky on this one.

Yes.

[Speaker 14] (19:07 - 20:35)
Good morning. Members of the committee. I'm Tom Pekarsky of the law firm of Gordon and Pekarsky representing the applicant to have the cutter so late.

We're before you seeking an amendment of the city of Chicago zoning map from the current be one to and see to to to that of a C to to for the property, commonly known as 7100 through 7118 South Halstead Street. The subject site measures, 121 feet along 71st Street, and 198.73 feet along Halstead Street. It is improved with a gas station.

The applicant would like to invest in the property and expand the gas station to include a larger convenience store. Unfortunately, the property has split zoning, and the B one to zoning does not permit a gas station and that that be one to is, since it is the more restrictive zoning is what controls. This amendment will unify the zoning of the entire lot to see to to to permit the investment into this site in for the expanded gas station and convenience store.

We have reviewed our plans with Alderman Moore, who is both present and has previously provided an indication of support by letter to the chairman. And therefore, we would seek the committee to vote its recommendation of passage of the application to the full city council. Thank you.

Thank you, Tom Alderman David more.

[Speaker 9] (20:36 - 21:37)
Thank you, Chairman and I thank them for this project let me first start saying, for me I grew up in this community. Before it used to be the 17th Ward then it went to the sixth ward and as back to the 17th board, and that particular gas station has been there for years over the years. When I, when I was in definitely when I was in sixth party when it was in seven as well there was some issues with people hanging out and like that and when this particular management took over they work with CPP.

They work with the automatic offices, and that was not only reduced but really eliminate the food. And, you know, and it's a place where people feel comfortable going so the fact that they're now building a standalone convenience store in there is something that's great for the community, and it would definitely enhance that space so it's definitely a project that support and I hope I can have your federal consideration and vote on this matter.

[Speaker 1] (21:38 - 21:58)
Thank you all the many questions for the applicant or the Alderman hearing down, can I get a motion to move to pass for the same role called it was used to determine quorum. So move by Alderman more Alderman more makes the motion. Any objections to his motion.

The school for social entrepreneurship doing business as Epic Academy with me today to provide testimony and answer questions are members from the applicant development team and the project architects, I would like to start today by inviting the applicant to speak briefly about the vision and goals for the project and the plan impact and benefits this project will have on the community.

[Speaker 8] (24:29 - 24:31)
Joining the panelists. Thank you.

[Speaker 5] (24:31 - 24:35)
Great, please introduce yourself and and proceed. Thank you.

[Speaker 8] (24:35 - 26:36)
Good morning everyone my name is Leandra Khan. I'm a lifelong Chicago and a former school student, a teacher, an assistant principal, a principal and a parent. I'm also the proud executive director at Epic Academy.

Epic was founded in 2009, with the goal of providing the students in the South Chicago community with a high quality high school option. I'm speaking today to talk about our desire to build a new school for the students of epic and the community of South Chicago. Epic now occupies a CPS elementary school built in 1902.

We are without a gym, an auditorium, a library, a full cooking kitchen, and adequate science lab for bathrooms. Yet, we've been able to provide our students with four years of college and career skills coursework, access to internships, dual credit and AP courses, a variety of elective and enrichment programs and so much more. But our students and families deserve so much more.

A new school for epic is an issue of equity and access, providing access to a high quality learning environment, and a state of the art facility shouldn't be a privileged. It should be a right for every student, especially students and communities whose families depend on quality education to catalyze generational advancement. Approving a new school building for epic in South Chicago will not only work to catalyze long lasting change in the lives of students, but it has the potential to serve as a much needed hub for the community, a community that far too long has experienced disinvestment.

Science tells us that environment is critical for the growth and development of any living thing. How much more is it true for our students at epic in its community. It's my hope that this body supports epic new building a new space because they can see themselves and every young person that walks into the building that they see brilliant leaders who just needs the opportunity to thrive, a new building shows them that we believe in them and are invested in their future.

Thanks for letting me speak.

[Speaker 5] (26:38 - 28:05)
Thank you. Leandra appreciate your comments this morning. As I understand this proposed rezoning is for the development of a new open enrollment charter high school, and the project will include the renovation of an existing four story school building and the construction of a new a four story expansion building to include those services that Leander talked about that would go with the new school including the gym cafeteria community space music and media room school offices will have 17 parking spaces and be approximately 67,000 square feet. This subject property is located on the campus of St. Michael's of the archangel school and church. The school was closed in 2018 and the church stopped holding regular services in 2021.

The proposed plan development will have two sub areas sub area a being the proposed new high school development and sub area B is the existing church, and the existing parking lot. At this time there's no new construction or development contemplated for the sub area be existing church building. The final design represents a project that has gone through a very thorough and collaborative design review process including comments received by committee on design.

And this project has the full support of the community and alderman Mitchell, that concludes our testimony today be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (28:06 - 28:18)
Thank you, Carol. I know I was on planning commission it's quite a elaborate complex regardless of what happens with the church. You didn't have any diagrams to show the committee.

[Speaker 5] (28:20 - 28:38)
We didn't weren't able to forward the link with the short amount of time that we had regarding the notice, we may be able to populate a link quickly here if we want to show that in advance of, of the, of the roll call vote.

[Speaker 1] (28:39 - 28:45)
Just depending on how easy it is just to get it like a one shot of the campus, I should say.

[Speaker 5] (28:46 - 29:12)
And can any of my architects populate a link image from JTMA, are you able to share a link to the plans, Carol I can put a link in the, in the chat if that helps.

[Speaker 8] (29:13 - 29:15)
Oh, it might.

[Speaker 5] (29:15 - 29:31)
I don't I don't even know how to put a link in the chat but is john from one Reynolds architecture from john Can you while working on that.

[Speaker 1] (29:32 - 29:33)
Other woman down.

[Speaker 19] (29:34 - 30:10)
Yes, thank you. I was gonna say while they're working on that I just wanted to give a shout out to Leandra, who was the principal of a high school in my community, and so good to see you in this role. Leandra and I wish you the best going forward I know under your leadership, you have, you will be taking this school to a new level, and congratulations, I support this project, and would like to be associated with the do pass motion.

When the time comes. Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (30:11 - 30:36)
Thank you all the woman. We do have a letter of support from all of them and Greg Mitchell. A couple of questions Leandra.

I know this is a huge, it's still fundraising task if I'm not mistaken. And then, would you comment a little bit on that and then also the number of students that you hope to be. Obviously, how many you have now and what's what's what's the future look like over there.

[Speaker 8] (30:37 - 31:34)
Great. Yes. So, currently we're around 400.

The current building doesn't have the capacity to go past like 525, the new building could get up to 800 or 1000 that may be like 120% usage. What else what was the other question. I'm sorry, the project cost.

Yeah project cost is 20, around $22 million. We've spent some of our cash already. We have been downstate and we have some support from state rep Tarver and we talked to some other elected, the black, black and Latino caucus are hopeful they'll support our project and we also have a capital, you know private funding capital campaign running parallel to it.

So we need to raise between five and $7 million. I'm pretty hopeful, we can finance about a million dollars in debt service a year. So, you know, we are at a point in the project.

[Speaker 1] (31:35 - 31:57)
Well that's good news I just want to make sure for the record that because I a member of planning commissions so I did see this project in its design and such. And me I do one other question. It's obviously the church what it's, it's certainly not in order what are the dreams of that particular building.

When is that in the PD.

[Speaker 8] (31:57 - 32:21)
It's not well, and then I'll let Carol out for that just to make sure I'm not misspeaking but the church is a beautiful space. The cardinal has not shared what they plan to do with it I know that there is a group trying to make sure that the church is a historic landmark, because it is a remarkable, remarkable space. So, we plan to be great neighbors and great partners with the church.

[Speaker 1] (32:22 - 32:47)
Well, it will stay hopefully the form to be exercised is yet to be determined. So, but good luck to you and congratulations. So Alderman Pat Dowell makes the motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections to that. Hearing none, the item is passed as revised. Okay.

There's times when you have to force developers to do what you want them to do and they look to cut corners. You, you sometimes with experience with 48 capital, because we don't know everything.

There's been projects that he's worked on, and I was like well you can do that he said no that's not quality that's not better. This is what you need to do. How often times you use developer to say that the tiny, and this has happened firsthand with me and I appreciate the products that he's bringing to the 17th word and the way they look so I have no doubt that this will be a good product for the 10th award so I moved to pass.

And now I'm in support of but I moved to pass as a motion on this.

[Speaker 1] (39:23 - 39:37)
Thank you, Alderman. Quick question from myself. Talk to me about.

I heard gallery at whatever it is. What else is going on in the commercial.

[Speaker 15] (39:38 - 40:44)
Yeah, so right now we have a couple options we're looking at a restaurant African palace that has a location somewhere else in South Chicago that's looking to take up about 4000 square feet, or a dinner spot for the neighborhood and she's hoping to open for breakfast and lunch eventually as well. In addition to this we have two options for the other retail space but are still open for other options as well one of the options we're exploring is having a community connected marketplace with lots of the local businesses of the community coming and having sort of a marketplace stand with a connected sort of cafe that we're, we're talking to different banks for sponsorship for the other alternative option we also are sort of exploring or other local retail in the neighborhood that are hoping to to build to create something here one of the folks is a bowling alley and we're really excited about that one as well. And hoping that anybody else with interest in retail and has an idea for that space would enter in a discussion with us, shouldn't we have in the gallery sky art sort of creating events and programming around art and community based events.

[Speaker 1] (40:45 - 40:51)
So what is the total square footage of the commercial opportunities, just under 10,000.

[Speaker 15] (40:51 - 40:54)
It's about, you know, good luck to you.

[Speaker 1] (40:55 - 41:40)
Appreciate it. Any other questions, comments, all the David Moore makes the motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections.

Hearing on the item is passed. Thank you. Okay, thank you.

Let's see, we're now on top of page for document number 22032. Again, in the 10th Ward ordinance was referred on December 14 of 2022. The common address is 3025 East 104th Street, and the change request from plan manufacturing development number six to plan manufacturing district number six, then to waterway plan development.

Michael Asger on this item again in the 10th Ward.

[Speaker 11] (41:41 - 42:06)
Thank you very much, Mr Chairman and members of the committee. Michael Asger from the law firm of Acosta as you're on behalf of the applicant county met river leading. And this matter is preliminarily this went to plan commission on April 20.

I will speak up, Michael speak up a little bit closer or went to plan commission on April 20, and we would respectfully request that the record of that proceeding be incorporated here today.

[Speaker 1] (42:09 - 42:23)
Alderman other woman Pat down was to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to our motion. Hearing none.

The records are now incorporated in front of us. Proceed.

[Speaker 11] (42:23 - 43:53)
Thank you, Mr Chairman so you can see from this image. The site on the Calumet River. The property has been in the next image if we go to the property has been used for over two decades as a boat and barge cleaning facility.

Many of the boats even the architectural tours come down here to be cleaned and service. And in a transition of ownership of the business. The applicant discovered that the business license was not renewed.

So we worked closely with Alderman Garza, as well as Department of Planning and Development to be able to renew this as a new use on the river. The part of the issues, we're not building anything new this is about a use. But the applicant did a good job of cleaning up site and satisfying the river ecology task force.

And if you look at the next image. You'll see the site. When my client inherited it, and then image afterwards is after working with DPD, the cleaned up site.

And so we can see that there's been a tremendous amount of progress. And again, there's going to be some landscaping incorporated and things that we again worked on with DPD. We have Alderman Garza's letter of support I'm not sure if she's here, but, but if she is she can certainly comment on it, and I'm available for any questions.

[Speaker 1] (43:56 - 44:55)
Thank you, Michael. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Garza. And it was obviously voted out of plan commission.

So, any questions comments from committee members. Hearing none, Alderman Kaplan makes a motion to move to pass by the same roll call it was used to determine form. Any, any objections.

Hearing none, these items passed as revised. Thank you very much. Thank you, Michael.

Now middle of page for document number two to 030 in the 12th ward ordinance was referred on December 14 of 2022. This common address 4435 Southwestern Boulevard, change requests from them to three light industry district and plan manufacturing district number eight sub area, a, all to a business plan development. And we have Liz Butler on this lizard Tyler, who's up.

[Speaker 2] (44:55 - 46:31)
Good morning, Mr chairman and members of the committee. It doesn't look like my witnesses were converted over to panelists. We have Brandon Barker Louie Abuna and Jason banger are still attendees, but I'll get started while they're being converted.

My name is Liz Butler for the record I'm a partner at the law firm of tax detainees and Hollister located at 111 East Walker Drive in Chicago. I'm appearing on behalf of the applicant in this matter pick tour 4435 s Western Boulevard LLC, an affiliate of Brookfield properties. And as I mentioned, I'm joined today by representatives of the applicant Jason banger is the, and I can see people are getting converted over.

Jason is the vice president of development for Brookfield properties, Brandon Barker is with space code the civil engineer for the project and Louie Abuna is with Kayla way the traffic engineer for the project. The applicant is before the committee today seeking its consideration it's favorable consideration of an application for a plan development to allow the redevelopment of the site that shown on the screen. Right now, it's an approximately 32.54 acre site with a common address of 4435 Southwestern Boulevard. This application was considered by the plan commission at its April meeting and received a favorable recommendation from plan commission, and we would request that the transcript and record of the plan commission proceedings be incorporated and made a part of the proceedings here today.

[Speaker 1] (46:32 - 46:38)
Before I get a motion incorporate the records to the planning commission I see Alderman Raymond Lopez your hands up.

[Speaker 3] (46:39 - 46:41)
Always chairman, I have questions.

[Speaker 1] (46:41 - 46:48)
Okay. Raymond, would you like to, would you make a motion to incorporate the plan records to the plan commission.

[Speaker 16] (46:49 - 46:50)
No, I will not.

[Speaker 1] (46:50 - 47:06)
Okay. All right. My vice chair rebellious moves to incorporate the records of the planning commission by the same roll call it was due to determine quorum and the objections.

Hearing none, the records are in front of us. Continue, Liz.

[Speaker 2] (47:06 - 52:55)
The subject property shown on the screen is generally bounded by 43rd Street on the north, the railroad on the east 47th on the south and western on the west. It's split zoned as m two three and planned manufacturing district, eight. The change request is to keep the underlying zoning and to establish a plan development developments that involve PMD zoning land with a net site area of 10 acres or more require plan development review so this was a mandatory PD review.

The existing improvements on the site are three industrial buildings that operate as the Wheatland tube company, a manufacturer and fabricator of steel pipe and other metal tubes. The site has been used for fabricating and manufacturing processes, as well as the storage of raw and finished goods warehousing and distribution functions. The plan development will allow the applicant who is now the owner of the property to demolish the existing structures remediate the site and redevelop it with re modern class a lead certified industrial buildings.

The heavy manufacturing and fabricating operations will be discontinued. This is a spec industrial development which means that there is not a specific tenant identified at this time. But we, the applicant anticipates that the site will be used for warehouse and distribution.

So again the applicant is an affiliate of Brookfield properties, who purchased the property in 2021 from Wheatland to, and Wheatland is now a tenant. It's expected that Wheatland will vacate the property in the coming years. And so while the applicant is not aware of what Wheatland tubes plans are in anticipation of Wheatland leaving Brookfield is envisioning a cleaner and more modern future use for this site.

The project will have approximately 703 parking spaces for passenger vehicles, 37 truck parking spaces, 82 loading docks and bicycle parking for employees. The development is master planned so that traffic and loading are accommodated internally. The development will provide robust landscaping and screening, including very generous landscaped perimeter setbacks, a 30 foot wide densely planted landscape buffer with a three foot berm will be provided along the southern perimeter of the site.

The plan involves planting 431 trees on the site and 174 shrubs compared to what exists today 43 trees and zero shrubs so that's a substantial increase in the both the quality and the quantity of landscaping. The proposal will incorporate sustainable development best practices, including achieving 100 points from the Chicago sustainable development policy and being lead certified like I mentioned. So with respect to air quality.

This plan development was subject to the city's air quality zoning ordinance, the existing Wheatland tube facility holds a permit through the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency that allows it to discharge up to 226 tons of volatile emissions per year. The proposed development will discontinue that permit and that practice and will not have those industrial manufacturing processes on the site. The, the applicant engaged an environmental expert to perform an air quality impact study that was completed to evaluate the potential air quality impact of the redevelopment of the site.

The study used the methodology from the EPA, which was based on guidance from the Chicago Department of Public Health. That study was posted publicly on the city's website and has been available for public review for over eight months. We also presented the findings of the study at a community meeting that was publicly noticed.

It was published in the Sun Times and notice was sent out to surrounding property owners. The city's Department of Public Health review the air quality impact study and agree that the proposed development does not exceed the national ambient air quality standards and issued an approval and recommendation for the project in December of 2022. The project involves an approximately $90 million investment in remediating and redeveloping what is today an aging and increasingly obsolete industrial facility.

The project is anticipated to create about 60 full time equivalent construction jobs and 400 to 600 permanent jobs, which is more than what exists at the site today. Under Wheatland Tubes operations at the site, the hiring for construction jobs will comply with the city's MBEWB participation goals. The project is in the 12th Ward, we met extensively with the prior Alderman, Alderman Cardenas, beginning in 2021 and throughout 2022.

And then in 2022 when Alderman Cardenas vacated his seat, we met with Alderman Abarca, who was appointed as the 12th Ward Alderman. We provided letters of support from both of those individuals and the Back of the Yards Neighborhood Council in advance of this hearing. That concludes our presentation.

I know that there are questions. Our team is available to answer any questions that the committee might have. We appreciate your attention and request your favorable consideration of this, this project.

[Speaker 3] (52:59 - 52:59)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (53:00 - 53:08)
So, Alderman Raymond Lopez, obviously, wants to comment on this. Raymond.

[Speaker 3] (53:09 - 54:04)
Thank you, Chairman and good morning members of the committee. This project law in the 12th Ward is completely surrounded by the 15th Ward. All of the people impacted and that will be impacted by this are my residents.

I first learned of this in April, a month ago, when I saw it in the news. And I'm not surprised because we've seen a heavy amount of warehouse investment along the borders between the 15th and 12th wards, where the approval comes from one ward. But the people that have to deal with the increased truck traffic, increased pollution, increased activity are in my ward and are not included in any of the conversations.

When was this community meeting held and where was it held?

[Speaker 2] (54:04 - 54:11)
Meeting was held in October of 2022. It was held at the Horizon Science Academy.

[Speaker 3] (54:13 - 54:15)
Which Horizons Academy?

[Speaker 2] (54:15 - 54:16)
On Pershing Road.

[Speaker 3] (54:17 - 54:27)
So, half a mile north of this site. Right. And what was the radius for the invitation for residents?

[Speaker 2] (54:28 - 54:32)
250 feet from the property lines.

[Speaker 3] (54:33 - 54:37)
So that would be approximately who? The people on Western Avenue?

[Speaker 2] (54:40 - 54:49)
We've filed an affidavit with the zoning administrator with the list of individuals that received the notice and we can make that available to the committee as well.

[Speaker 3] (54:50 - 55:09)
Because there are thousands of people who have been impacted by this location and many more who see and are concerned about the increased truck traffic that we're going to have on 47th Street, assuming that's the only egress and ingress for this location. How does your traffic study address that?

[Speaker 2] (55:10 - 55:34)
Could we show the site plan on the screen and then I'm going to ask Louie if you could unmute yourself and we can field questions about access. And maybe we can also address how the traffic associated with the proposed development compares to what exists today based on the traffic study.

[Speaker 3] (55:39 - 55:41)
Yes, good morning. This is Louie Abuna.

[Speaker 17] (55:42 - 56:41)
I'm a principal at KLA. Yeah, we did perform a traffic study for the proposed development. And as you can see from this exhibit, the main access to the development will be via the existing traffic signal at 45th Street that has signalized intersections with both Western Boulevard and Western Avenue.

So we anticipate that the majority of the truck traffic will be utilizing this signal to access Western Avenue. There is access currently provided on 47th Street and this access is currently used by the truck traffic from the existing use on site. We do anticipate a similar amount of truck traffic to use it.

It is not high volume. It's several few trucks during the peak hours. But again, we anticipate that the majority of the truck traffic will be utilizing the signalized intersection of Western Avenue.

[Speaker 3] (56:42 - 56:50)
I'm sorry, how many bays are in this location that you're proposing for this warehouse distribution center?

[Speaker 2] (56:51 - 56:54)
82 loading docks and 37 truck parking spaces.

[Speaker 3] (56:54 - 57:35)
So you have the potential of having 82 trucks coming in and out and through a one lane between Western Avenue and Western Boulevard, as well as you're saying doesn't happen, which I know does happen is the over-reliance on 47th Street, which has no traffic circle at that exit. That's what we're relying on? Well, the truck...

It's a yes or no. That's what you're relying on? I'm clear.

[Speaker 17] (57:35 - 57:41)
We're relying on these two main entry points of entrance and exit. But again...

[Speaker 3] (57:41 - 1:00:56)
So that's a yes? Yes. So on 47th Street, where there is no light, you're going to have truck traffic trying to cut through at that southern exit.

And you're going to have truck traffic cutting across and presumably not using the boulevard, which we see happen every single day, despite being illegal and constricted by two viaducts, and hope that they go to Western Avenue on a one lane narrow road that connects the avenue and the boulevard. With no light improvement, with no expansion of that road, that's what we're relying on. I raise this concern because while it sounds good, the constrictions on this site are incredible.

And they are very well known to everyone who lives in this neighborhood, of Brighton Park in particular, who face the Wheatland Tube Factory. To say you put out notice, to say that the community is aware, no one's aware. Nobody's talking about it.

Because you did the bare minimum to include my residents who are going to be the most impacted and have been the most impacted on all sides. I think, and we've had this discussion before, Chairman, in zoning, that when you have major issues like this, it cannot just fall to one alderman when the impacted community is another. We, the developer, designer, and the city, have never had a conversation about this matter.

We've never discussed the impact of what this will do to traffic, to the situations already that are also, by the way, going to be even more difficult, especially if we're relying on 47th Street. Because DPD just put Harvest Foods at what formerly is a Damon Avenue and has all of their truck traffic exiting onto 47th Street as well. In between the two of them, for the committee's edification, is a high school where children are constantly walking and being dropped off and delivered.

Where you see the traffic flow constrict down to one lane because parents are lining up and drop off and dismissal waiting for their children. Like a clogged artery, now we're putting more pressure on 47th Street, which means more pressure will be put on Western because 47th Street will be unobtainable for the amount of truck traffic that you're going to put through here at any given point. That you're planning for and expecting to be there in order for this to be a fully functional warehouse.

So Chairman, I cannot support this. And actually I would make a motion to defer this until we are sure that the concerns of my residents have been met and addressed properly. Motion to defer this item or do you want to hold it in committee?

Defer it? Defer it, please.

[Speaker 1] (1:00:57 - 1:01:09)
Okay, so Alderman Raymond Lopez makes a motion to defer this item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to Alderman Beal?

[Speaker 21] (1:01:10 - 1:01:24)
Mr. Chairman, by deferring this item, that will bring it to the next meeting. If you hold it in committee, that gives us time to get a thorough traffic study to be presented to all the surrounding Aldermen, correct?

[Speaker 1] (1:01:25 - 1:01:30)
Hold on a second. Anthony, Nicole, would you?

[Speaker 24] (1:01:30 - 1:01:40)
By deferring this, it doesn't bring it to the next meeting. It's deferring it until it's ready to be brought back up. It's not the same as deferring and publishing like in City Council.

[Speaker 21] (1:01:41 - 1:01:42)
Okay, thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:01:43 - 1:02:51)
So it'll be up to the team and the Alderman, and in this case, all their people, you know, to talk about a myriad of issues that I think Alderman Lopez has brought to the committee's attention. So with that being said, this item will be deferred and held in committee. Any objections to that?

Okay, so hearing no objections, this will be deferred until further notice. All right. All right, team.

Obviously, the team needs to get out and do a little bit more due diligence to the surrounding neighbors and of course the new Alderman, I believe it's in 12. All right. Bottom of page for document number 21100 t one in the 28th Ward, the ordinance was referred on July 20 of 2022 the common address is 1434 West Flournoy, and the change request from our team for residential to flat townhouse and multi district to be to three neighborhood mixed use district.

And this in this one we have Tyler manic in the 28th Ward.

[Speaker 13] (1:02:52 - 1:03:21)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Tyler manic with the law firm of Shane banks Canyon Schwartz. I'm here on behalf of the applicant Pilsen rentals LLC, which owns a subject property at 1434 West Florida.

Procedurally, we submitted a substitute narrative and plans to the zoning administrator. So if this committee could amend the application to prove those appreciate it.

[Speaker 1] (1:03:23 - 1:03:28)
Okay. Our committee does not have a copy, Anna. Would you.

[Speaker 25] (1:03:29 - 1:03:41)
Yeah, I understand. Tyler that you spoke with Patrick yesterday and decided not to submit the substitute. Yeah, so we're going to go with the original submission.

[Speaker 13] (1:03:42 - 1:03:42)
Correct.

[Speaker 25] (1:03:43 - 1:03:45)
Okay, so no substitute.

[Speaker 1] (1:03:45 - 1:03:51)
That's what we read into the record right Anna so we can proceed. Correct. Tyler.

[Speaker 13] (1:03:51 - 1:05:01)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, the subject property is a transit serve location, and is currently improved with a three and a half story multifamily building containing eight well units. However, the two garden units were discovered to be can be non conforming. This zoning map amendment from an art to four to three zoning district seems to bring these two garden units into a conforming to conformity with the zoning ordinance.

And because this property falls outside the pilot area which would otherwise allow these two garden units, this zoning map map amendment is necessary. Other than rendering these two units conforming no changes will be made to the existing building. The applicant resides in one of the units at the small family building, and the applicant participated in a well attended community meeting.

And after a lengthy process of working with all of them in urban in the community. I believe all the men urban has confirmed his support for this application to the committee. With the support of all the men urban, I respectfully request this committee's favorable support and stone zoning map amendment application.

I'd be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (1:05:03 - 1:05:29)
We have a basic conversation with all men urban and he has no objection to that. Okay. All right.

Questions, comments from committee members. Hearing on Alderman Kappelman makes a motion move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections.

Hearing on the item is passed.

[Speaker 13] (1:05:29 - 1:05:31)
Thank you, Mr. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:05:31 - 1:06:21)
Okay. All right, top of page five. Document number 22038 in the 29th ward, the ordinance was referred on December 14 of 2022.

The common address is 5049 through 5133 West Harrison 601 through 629 South Laramie Avenue 5000 through 55132 West Flournoy 610 through 628 South Laverne Avenue. And this change request from an RT for residential to flat and multi unit district, and one to limited manufacturing business park district. And then to an institutional plan development.

We have Scott Borenstein on this item in 29.

[Speaker 4] (1:06:21 - 1:07:28)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, again Scott Borenstein with the laws of Neal and Leroy here on behalf of Chicago Public Schools. I can't tell if they joined, but we've got Chris meal from our engineering firm, and Evan Smith from Chicago Public Schools. That are part of our team here to go through the slides.

But just briefly so this was a matter that was heard before the plan commission that it's April hearing. And we would respectfully request that all the records and findings from the planning commission which by the way includes a substitute ordinance, which you should have. Right, there it is.

We went from the RT for in the M12 to be three one, and then to the institutional plan development, but that should all be in the planning commission records, which again we request that you incorporate in today's hearing.

[Speaker 1] (1:07:29 - 1:07:44)
Alderman Hopkins moves to incorporate the records from the planning commission by the same roll call that was used to determine form. Any objections. Hearing on the records are incorporated with the substitute that you already referred to.

Terrific. Thank you.

[Speaker 4] (1:07:44 - 1:07:52)
So, with that, I'll just quickly turn I see Chris is here, I'll turn it over to him to go quickly through the slides, and then we're here to answer any questions.

[Speaker 10] (1:07:54 - 1:09:46)
Great. Thank you, Scott. Thank you all for the opportunity to talk about our project.

Next slide please. Existing zoning map, like Scott mentioned RT for an M one to propose rezoning be three dash one to an institutional plan development. Next slide please.

Context plan just showing the existing Michelle Clark high school campus, as well as the surrounding area and community. I to 90 to the south site is bounded by Harrison Laverne floor annoying and Laramie, and the new parcel. Part of the project is kind of on the north side of the slide here.

Next, next slide please. Proposed scope of work for the project includes a new full size artificial turf football field bleachers press box. There will also be a little Plaza space to the west of that just east of the existing school will have a new artificial turf play field with a walking track, and then on the far west side of the school Jason to Laramie is a new parking lot.

And of course there will be new landscaping, a variety of trees shrubs ground covers planted all throughout campus and in the state of Chicago right away. Next slide please. Last slide here is just economic community benefits a few things to know, project budget.

And then the NW be participation for the project is 30% for me and 7% for WB.

[Speaker 4] (1:09:46 - 1:10:22)
Thanks, Chris. I just would add that, you know, we did have some negotiations with the planning department about really about the landscaping but we obviously came to a good compromise on that in terms of the design review, and then of course we vetted it with all the mentality of in the community, and the ultimate has provided a letter of support. So, with that we would rest and of course, Chris and Evan are here to answer any questions.

[Speaker 3] (1:10:27 - 1:10:28)
You're on mute Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (1:10:30 - 1:11:13)
Thank you staff. All right. Any questions comments from committee members.

We do have a letter of support from Alderman tell the Pharaoh. All right, hearing none Alderman Kaplan makes a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections.

Hearing none, this item is passed as revised. Scott just yes one more question on this thing though I'm sure 16 million right is this what, where is all that money going into. I'll let Evan address that.

Seems it's quite a bit, I don't know if I'm sorry maybe I didn't listen to the entire, but it's buildings being renovated.

[Speaker 20] (1:11:13 - 1:11:38)
Also, there, there are multiple phases of the site work plus I believe that dollar figure may have actually accounted for. And I'm sorry Alderman this is Evan Smith CPS may have accounted for purchase of the land, which I believe was a couple million dollars, but there are multiple things happening at the school including this site, and the other work that Chris I think.

[Speaker 1] (1:11:39 - 1:11:42)
I see a lot of improvements to athletic fields.

[Speaker 20] (1:11:44 - 1:11:48)
Yeah, there's tennis courts they're parking Chris you want to jump in here real quick.

[Speaker 10] (1:11:48 - 1:12:20)
Yeah, sure. Yeah, there was a tennis court. Identify yourself for the record.

Sure, Chris Mealy with Eva design and engineering engineer record for the project and Michelle Clark. Yes, there's tennis courts that were part of a previous phase. There's a substantial underground utility and stormwater improvements there's lighting proposed for the football field as well as pedestrian and parking lot lighting.

There's cameras security cameras telecom.

[Speaker 1] (1:12:21 - 1:12:44)
So a number of improvements made really throughout the entire site parking lot improvements also, but mostly exterior and landscaping and obviously creation of new new turf fields. Okay. Yes, sir.

All right. Okay. So this item is passed as revised.

Congratulations to the 29th ward and all the telephoto and to CBS.

[Speaker 20] (1:12:45 - 1:12:45)
Great, thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:12:46 - 1:13:28)
Thank you. The great, great high school with now even better amenities, so. All right.

Middle of page five document number two to 102 in the 42nd ward ordinance was referred to March 15 of 2023. The common addresses are 314 through 332 North Clark Street, 315 through 333 North LaSalle Street, and one on one through 131 West Carroll Avenue, and the change request waterway business plan development number 1342 to water way business plan development number 1342 as amended. I think Mr. George is on the call on this item in 42nd ward. Yes, yes, yes.

[Speaker 3] (1:13:31 - 1:13:41)
Good morning. Good morning. You're still echoing Joe.

I'm sorry.

[Speaker 23] (1:13:42 - 1:13:46)

[Speaker 22] (1:13:49 - 1:13:50)
Is that better.

[Speaker 3] (1:13:54 - 1:13:56)
That better can hear me now.

[Speaker 23] (1:13:58 - 1:14:03)
You have to log out of zoom from the other I can just remove you if that's okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:14:04 - 1:14:09)
Why don't you do that, please, so we can get a clear voice of Mr. George.

[Speaker 23] (1:14:10 - 1:14:12)
Okay, now try, Mr. George.

[Speaker 6] (1:14:12 - 1:14:14)
Can you hear me now.

[Speaker 23] (1:14:14 - 1:14:14)
Yes.

[Speaker 6] (1:14:15 - 1:15:02)
Good morning Mr Chairman and members of the committee my name is john George I'm an attorney with offices 71 South Walker with a law firm of acrement LLC. I'm appearing this morning on behalf of the client of mine which is 322 North Clark LLC. What we're seeking to do is to amend PD 1342 to permit a residential use as a permitted use under the existing plan development 1342.

This is a technical amendment to allow for the residential use as part of this PD. Mr Chairman and members of the committee this matter was before the Chicago Plan Commission on April the 20th and I would ask at this time that the record of proceeding testimony and documents that were part of that proceeding be incorporated into and be made as part of the proceedings before you today.

[Speaker 1] (1:15:04 - 1:15:15)
All the Hopkins moves to incorporate the record plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections, hearing on the records are incorporated, please proceed.

[Speaker 6] (1:15:16 - 1:16:49)
As I said, Mr Chairman, this amendment would be running a residential use at this site. In addition to permitting the residential use at this site. We have already incorporated as part of this amendment.

Other matters that were part of minor change letters which provided for the decking over kind of deck decking over Carol Street. Also, the pattern that would be used the traffic pattern that would be used here, which would allow us to cars to come in off of Clark Street and exit on LaSalle Street, as well as other provisions that were in the minor change letters. As this time the developer in addition to doing this as a residential use it's not what's the understanding that when the developer seeks to go forward with the residential use.

This would come before the plan commission again, as well as the committee on zoning, there would be community meetings in the in this word which is alderman Riley's word 42. And all of those requirements would be here to it with respect to this, as well as meetings with other city agencies for that plan development amendment, when, when they come forward with it as well as they would then have to have their bulk table, specifying the exact number of dwelling units as well as the traffic patterns that would be used. Alderman Riley did submit a letter of support before the plan commission.

I know, Mr Chairman and members of the committee have no any other any other objections to this matter, and I would ask for a favorable vote for this matter that's before you today.

[Speaker 3] (1:16:53 - 1:16:57)
All right. Jack.

[Speaker 1] (1:16:57 - 1:17:08)
What are we doing here today versus the requirement for them to go back to 42, and the plank this what literally are we doing today with this.

[Speaker 6] (1:17:08 - 1:17:36)
All you're doing today Mr Chairman is allowing residential use as a permitted as the use that all category. There's nothing more than that and that all that does that is to allow the developer of the property to when he's meeting with people who might develop it in that with the residential use to know that a residential use is a permitted use, but that's all it does it still the requirement for coming back to the plan commission the zoning committee.

[Speaker 1] (1:17:36 - 1:17:45)
Okay, I get it, I get it. Now, let me ask you another question. You're putting something over Carol explain that again.

[Speaker 6] (1:17:45 - 1:18:59)
Well there's going to be a decking as part of this. There's going to be a decking over Carol Street, which would be creating a plaza, and that plaza then would be open to the public with certain restrictions as to time, and what would be what would be allowed on that. This is something that was negotiated very extensively with Alderman Brendan Riley, and this was something that we felt everyone felt I think is a good addition to this development, and one that would be good for the community.

I don't know if Riley is still on the call or not but I know that something we discussed a great length with them. What is the height of this deck level. Oh boy.

I don't know the height of the deck level alderman, it's. It would be, it would be where you'll the South Street is that now it would be just even with LaSalle Street so when your cars would come in and go along the side to drop people off here at this area, they would then go along the northern side of the Carol Street as elevated, and it would go right down to LaSalle Street, even with LaSalle Street I don't, I don't know that I would say it would, you know, when I'm when I've been standing on several street is maybe 25 or 30 feet I don't know.

[Speaker 1] (1:19:00 - 1:19:21)
Okay, well I'm sure this was thoroughly engaged with the community and and see that. Okay. Other questions, comments from committee members.

Again, we do have a letter of support from Alderman Riley. Brendan Are you on the call you want to say anything.

[Speaker 6] (1:19:23 - 1:19:45)
I think he's in the middle. I also wanted to say before I finished that on behalf of myself and I know of other of my colleagues who appeared before you over the years. I just wanted to say thanks for the leadership that you've given to all of the lawyers and also to all of our projects over the years but I just wanted to say thanks for all of the help and guidance you've given us.

[Speaker 1] (1:19:45 - 1:20:05)
You're welcome. It's been a two way street. So, all right.

So, the motion by Alderman Kaplan move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections. Hearing none this item is passed as revised.

[Speaker 26] (1:20:05 - 1:20:06)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (1:20:06 - 1:20:32)
Thank you very much. Now we're on page six document number 22145 t one in the 45th Ward ordinance was referred to March 15 of 2023 common address 5415 West Higgins to change request from the three one community shopping district to be three three community shopping districts. Rich cloud or is here on this one.

[Speaker 7] (1:20:32 - 1:23:14)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman, and members of the committee for the record rich cloud or from the law firm of DLA Piper. We do represent the applicant in this matter Chicago center, excuse me Chicago Arts Center, which does business as the ed patch the art center in the 45th Ward. Just a quick note of background companion type one applications were filed for two properties, one located at 5411 West Higgins which is not the subject of this matter, and also the one that is the subject of this matter which is 5415 West Higgins.

Both of those applications, sought to rezone the properties from the B three one shopping center, or excuse me community shopping district to the B three three community shopping district to allow expansion and new construction of a mixed use project that will include cultural exhibit and accessory retails and office. The application for 5411 West Higgins was previously deferred by this committee earlier today, as it has not yet received full community input approval that application, ultimately will enable construction of a national veterans art museum. That would be located next door immediately to the east of this property that application would involve the reuse of the existing commercial building and in addition to allow for occupancy by the National Veterans Art Museum.

We expect to be able to bring that project back to this committee once it's received community review in the near future. The project at hand for which we seek approval today relates to the property at 5415 West Higgins. This application would involve the construction of a very modest addition to the existing two story building on the property, property that is currently home to the Ed Pashke Arts Center.

It has been reviewed by the community is less than 1320 square feet from the Jefferson Park Transit Center and features a building of approximately 34 feet in height, and the total total building square footage of some 11,800 square feet. The expansion will allow for larger exhibit displays and an office area for the Ed Pashke Arts Center. That Arts Center, as many of you may know, commemorates and displays the works of Ed Pashke, a notable Chicago artist.

A letter has been placed on file on behalf of Alderman Gardner, and with respect to this application number 2214-5-T1 for the property 5415 West Higgins, we would ask for a recommendation of approval and for your consideration of this application. Alderman, excuse me, Chairman Tunney, I would like to add my voice to the many of us who commend you for your years of service to this committee and to the city, and I wish you the very best in the next chapter.

[Speaker 1] (1:23:16 - 1:23:20)
Thanks, but wait till you see what I ask about this, but before you start congratulating.

[Speaker 7] (1:23:22 - 1:23:24)
I'm very pleased with your service.

[Speaker 1] (1:23:24 - 1:23:38)
I've been to the Pashke Center. Your comments on specifically 5415, what is the size of the expansion? You said total right now is 10,000 or is that with this modest addition according to your area?

[Speaker 7] (1:23:38 - 1:23:44)
It'll be a total of 11,800 square feet. The expansion is about 3,000 square feet, so very modest.

[Speaker 3] (1:23:48 - 1:23:48)
Okay.

[Speaker 7] (1:23:50 - 1:24:06)
And the height remains 34 feet, so ultimately this will link up with the property next door, but that property has not been fully vetted by the community, and so we decided that we could at least begin to make the modest additions to the Pashke Arts Center itself.

[Speaker 1] (1:24:10 - 1:24:25)
And just one other not zoning issue. Ed, the Pashke Arts Center has been in the 45th Ward for many years. Was he a resident of that neighborhood?

[Speaker 7] (1:24:26 - 1:25:07)
You know, I don't know the answer to that. I actually did do some research on him. He passed away about 18 years ago very suddenly.

He isn't himself a veteran. He served in the 1920s, and actually, check that, in the 1960s, and I believe served with distinction. He then became a prominent artist, displaying his works in multiple publications and galleries across the country, and Lionel Rabb, who is a 45th Ward resident, is a big fan of his and wanted to commemorate his work and his service to the country and has done so and now seeks to expand the exhibit space.

[Speaker 1] (1:25:07 - 1:25:18)
Yeah, well, I was smart enough to buy into his artwork many, many years ago. I was aware of his abilities. His artwork is stunning.

[Speaker 7] (1:25:20 - 1:25:21)
It is indeed.

[Speaker 1] (1:25:21 - 1:25:50)
All right. Other questions, comments from committee members? Alderman Burnett makes the motion to move due pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum, noting, as the attorney said, we do have a letter of support from Alderman Gardner.

Burnett makes the motion. Any objections to the motion? Hearing none, this item is passed.

Good luck. The committee would love to see what's going on with the Veterans Museum in the near future.

[Speaker 7] (1:25:51 - 1:25:54)
Thank you. Good luck to you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:25:55 - 1:26:31)
All right. Now we're on, let's see, middle of page six, document number 22107, 47th Ward. Ordinance was referred on March 15th of 2023.

The common address of this one is 1941 through 1955 West Lawrence Avenue, 4736 through 4756 North Winchester Avenue. The change request from B12 neighborhood shopping district to RM 4.5 residential multi-unit district. And we have Scott Bornstein again on this item in 47.

[Speaker 4] (1:26:31 - 1:26:38)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just before we started, I guess these are your last.

[Speaker 1] (1:26:38 - 1:26:48)
No, no, no. Keep going. Keep going.

You got another, you got another, you got another thing in front of us too. So, let's stick to 47 versus 44. Okay.

[Speaker 4] (1:26:48 - 1:27:04)
These are, these two are companion. There's the 22107 and then the 22108. These both relate to McPherson Elementary School in the 47th Ward.

Okay, so why don't I do this, Scott.

[Speaker 1] (1:27:04 - 1:28:00)
I'll just read the final item, because it is the same project and I'll read that into the record and you will discuss one, you know, the project in its entirety. So, in addition to number 22107, we're going to read into the record 22108. Again, 47th Ward ordinance was referred on March 15th of 2023.

This common address is 1901 through 1937 West Lawrence Avenue, 4718 through 4756 North Walcott, 4731 through 4757 North Winchester. And the change request from RS3 Residential Single Unit Detached House District to an RM4.5 Residential Multi-Unit District. So, this is all about a school campus in the 47th Ward.

We're going to hear the presentation both together.

[Speaker 4] (1:28:00 - 1:30:24)
Thank you so much. Yes, so exactly. This is the McPherson Elementary School campus in the 47th Ward.

It's unique in that it's split down the middle by Winchester Avenue. And that's the reason why we have to do two separate applications. Just under the zoning rules, you know, when you have an intervening public right of way, you have to consider those two separate zoning lots.

So, we've got two different applications, but it's really one campus. And in fact, Winchester Avenue is closed right to vehicular traffic. And that's where we're doing our improvements for this particular project.

This is a playground improvement project. And Evan Smith from Chicago Public Schools is here. We can get into more details about the project, but from a zoning perspective, we're doing a couple things.

We also have split zoning here. And one of the portions, we have a B zone. And so again, public schools, you have to go get a special use in order to do a school in a B zone.

So, we like to clean these up and make them all R zoning. So, we don't have any permitting issues going forward. So, in this particular case, we took both sides of Winchester and we are zoning them to the R45 district.

And the reason for that is, again, to get everything into an R zone. And then the R45 is being selected because that was the zoning district that could accommodate the bulk and density of the existing school. Right.

So, we're not making any changes to the building. We're not enlarging it. But just because of its existing size, we needed the R45 district to be able to accommodate it.

So, again, it's a playground project. It's really cleaning up the existing zoning, but it's a wonderful improvement for 47th Ward. And I think it's not the most exciting case, but it's a wonderful one for you to conclude on, Alderman, because it's a great project for the public.

And similar to your service as Alderman and Chairman of this committee, it's been a great public service as well. So, we thank you and wish you good luck in all your future endeavors.

[Speaker 1] (1:30:26 - 1:30:50)
Thank you, Scott. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Martin. Just while we have CPS on the call, what is the value of these improvements?

Speaking of what we did in the 29th Ward, I'm being selfish because my assistant, my new Alderman is eager to see what we can do in 44 as we continue to improve our schools.

[Speaker 20] (1:30:51 - 1:30:54)
I apologize, Alderman. I don't have the dollars. Do we have our architect on here, Scott?

[Speaker 1] (1:30:55 - 1:31:08)
I don't see Kelsey, so I don't think they were able to make it. Well, it's not going to impair my vote, but I just want, you know, if you get it through the chair before the next couple of days, okay?

[Speaker 20] (1:31:09 - 1:31:10)
Absolutely. Yes.

[Speaker 1] (1:31:10 - 1:31:10)
All right.

[Speaker 4] (1:31:10 - 1:31:22)
I would just venture to say it's a playground project. We're putting in artificial turf. You know, again, this is just a guess based on similar projects, but probably a couple million dollars.

[Speaker 20] (1:31:22 - 1:31:27)
I would imagine such maybe three million or so, but I'll get that exact number and send it over.

[Speaker 1] (1:31:27 - 1:31:29)
Through the chair for the next couple of days. Okay.

[Speaker 20] (1:31:29 - 1:31:30)
All right. Yep. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:31:31 - 1:32:29)
That being said, Alderman Burnett moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum on items number 22107 and also 22108, both applications in the 47th Ward. Any objections to the motion. Hearing none.

This item is passed. As all these, these will be reported out, except the one that was deferred to the next city council meeting, which I believe will be sometime in May. So, with that being said, Alderman Riley moves to adjourn by the same rule to determine quorum.

Any objections. Hearing none. This meeting is adjourned.

Thanks to the staff, legislative staff, the Department of Planning. Good luck. Thank you.

[Speaker 23] (1:32:29 - 1:32:30)
Thank you.

[Speaker 3] (1:32:33 - 1:32:34)
Thank you, Chairman.
