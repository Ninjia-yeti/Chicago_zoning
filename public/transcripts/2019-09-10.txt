Any opposed? Can you ensure the ayes have it and these items are deferred. So before we take public comment, we have a number of appointees that are very busy people and I would like to take them up to get them before us and hopefully get them on their way.

So we have several appointments today to the zoning board of appeals and the plan commission. All the resumes for appointees should be in front of you. It's again in your orange file folder and in your packet.

So let's go. We're going to start with Mayoral Appointment 1909, the appointment of Zurich S. Esposito as a member of the zoning board of appeals for a term effective immediately and expiring on July 1st, 2024 to succeed Shaina Dorr whose term has expired.

So we'll start with Zurich S. Esposito. Can you come on up?

I think you're right over here, I believe. I think that mic is on. Good morning, sir.

You want to speak into the mic, identify yourself for the record and your desire to be on the zoning board of appeals.

[Speaker 31] (8:27 - 8:30)
Thank you, Chairman Tunney.

[Speaker 1] (8:30 - 8:34)
Sometimes I don't know why someone would want to do that, but we're glad you're here.

[Speaker 31] (8:35 - 10:53)
I'm glad too. Thank you, Chairman Tunney and members of the committee. My name is Zurich S.

Esposito and I come before the committee seeking confirmation for my appointment to the zoning board of appeals. I am a resident of Chicago's 33rd Ward where I live on Wilson Avenue with my husband, Brian McCormick, a Chicago public school teacher. Professionally, I'm the executive vice president for AIA Chicago, the Chicago chapter of the American Institute of Architects, a professional association for members of the architecture and design community.

AIA Chicago is a 150-year-old organization this year, and we have a membership currently of about 4,000 individuals in the Chicago area. We are among the largest local chapters of the American Institute of Architects, which has a national membership of about 90,000 individuals. AIA Chicago supports the local design community by providing our members with learning opportunities that qualify for helping them retain their professional architecture licenses.

We also provide training programs to prepare emerging professionals to take the actual architects licensing exam itself. We organize a roster of awards programs throughout the year to recognize both design excellence and professional leadership. We also collaborate with other organizations and agencies on special initiatives like a recent design competition we organized in collaboration with Neighborhood Housing Services focused on affordable housing.

AIA Chicago and many of our members were also very involved in the city's transition to a modernized building code, working closely with the Department of Buildings. As part of our 150th anniversary, we launched a new diversity scholarship program. It's to provide financial support to students attending one of the local schools of architecture, colleges of architecture here in Chicago.

One way of supporting and fostering diversification in the architecture and design community locally. It would be a pleasure and privilege to serve on the Zoning Board of Appeals, and I'm pleased to assist City Council and the Mayor in helping make Chicago as represented by the built environment the best that it can be. I'm happy to answer any of your questions.

Great. Good. Thank you.

And questions from committee members?

[Speaker 1] (10:55 - 12:41)
Committee members? We have a distinguished person from the Institute of Architects, which I personally believe is a real asset to obviously the decisions that come in front of the Zoning Board of Appeals. And I see any questions?

I see you're eminently qualified to do that. Can I have a motion on the appointment of Zurich Esposito? So moved by Alderman Lopez.

All those in favor? And any opposed? No.

Opinions here, the ayes have it. Good luck and look forward to working with you. Thank you very much.

Likewise. Next. Mayoral appointment 1910, the appointment of Timothy Knutson as an alternate member of Zoning Board of Appeals for the term effective immediately and expiring July 1st, 2024.

Timothy, small town, isn't it? Anyways, just for the benefit of the members on the Zoning Committee, the mayor has now, we have a few alternates so that we are required to maintain, is it correct me if I'm wrong, you need at least a minimum of three at the Zoning Board of Appeals to effectively do the city business. So we will now have not only the board members, but we'll have alternates.

So it's going to be hopefully a very responsive group. So Timothy, your appointment Zoning Board of Appeals effective immediately and expiring July 1st of 2024.

[Speaker 60] (12:41 - 13:34)
Good morning. Good morning. Good morning, Chairman Tunney and Zoning Committee members.

My name is Timothy Knutson, and I'm an appointee to the Zoning Board of Appeals and a resident of the 43rd Ward. Currently, I work as an attorney in the corporate practice of the law firm Catton Neusch & Rosenman focusing on private equity transactions and venture capital investments. While at Catton, I have committed significant time to service in the local Chicago community and to pro bono work in the legal industry.

Much of the pro bono work I do relates to LGBTQ immigration issues and the corporate organization of not-for-profit corporations. I'm honored to be appointed to the Zoning Board of Appeals by Mayor Lightfoot and to seek your committee's confirmation. I look forward to serving Chicago.

Thank you, Timothy. Questions for Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 4] (13:37 - 13:59)
Thank you, Chairman. Actually, I just have a question, and it might not even be for you. I'll direct it to whomever can answer.

But is the Zoning Board of Appeals created by ordinance or by order from the mayor? Because how, then, would you be able to ordinance?

[Speaker 3] (14:03 - 14:26)
The question for the department, Patrick Murphy. Alderman, it is created by ordinance. They do have rules of procedures that they operate by.

And I believe it was in 2018, the former administration expanded it by adding the alternate positions, like the chairman said, to help fill in when there are vacancies of the regular members. And those alternate positions were not filled prior to today.

[Speaker 4] (14:28 - 14:36)
OK, so it is allowed to have alternates. It wasn't just something that was magically added. They were just never used before.

[Speaker 3] (14:36 - 14:37)
It was added through an amendment.

[Speaker 4] (14:37 - 14:42)
No, but I mean, it was there previously. We just never did it with the previous mayor.

[Speaker 3] (14:42 - 14:44)
It's been there for about two years.

[Speaker 4] (14:44 - 14:45)
OK, thank you.

[Speaker 1] (14:46 - 14:46)
Other questions?

[Speaker 10] (14:49 - 15:02)
Yes, Alderman Beal. What's your opinion as far as automatic prerogatives and aldermen having the right to have input and veto authority on zoning matters in their ward?

[Speaker 60] (15:02 - 15:14)
Yeah, I believe aldermen have a unique intelligence on their specific communities. So my opinion is that I'll take an alderman's point of view into consultation.

[Speaker 10] (15:15 - 15:18)
That's it? You would just take his input or her input?

[Speaker 60] (15:19 - 15:21)
I'll take input into consultation, correct.

[Speaker 10] (15:22 - 15:41)
Very seriously. If an alderman disagrees with something that's coming before the Zoning Board of Appeals and has proven that whatever the item is is a detriment to their community, what would be your opinion on that?

[Speaker 60] (15:43 - 15:44)
Sorry, will you repeat the question?

[Speaker 10] (15:45 - 16:01)
If an alderman or alderperson has an item before the Zoning Board of Appeals and argues that the item that they're arguing against is a detriment to their community and they don't want it, what would be your opinion?

[Speaker 60] (16:03 - 16:09)
My opinion is I would take that into serious consultation. Okay, thank you. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (16:10 - 16:54)
All right, other questions for Timothy? If not, do I have a motion for the appointment of Timothy, can I say Knudson? Knudson.

Knudson, as an alternate member of the Zoning Board of Appeals. Motion? Motion by Alderman Cardona.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

Can you and the Chair of the Ayes have it? And welcome and look forward to working with you too. Thank you.

All right, moving on. Mayoral appointment 19-11. The appointment of James Ruddick Jr. as an alternate member of the Zoning Board of Appeals for the term effective immediately and expiring on July 1st, 2024. James?

[Speaker 11] (17:06 - 17:07)
Here I am.

[Speaker 1] (17:08 - 17:08)
Good morning, sir.

[Speaker 11] (17:09 - 17:10)
Good morning, how are you?

[Speaker 1] (17:11 - 17:13)
Wonderful. Talk to us.

[Speaker 11] (17:13 - 17:57)
Good morning, my name is James Ruddick. I have the privilege and honor of living in the 33rd Ward and serving as the Executive Director of the Northwest Side Housing Center located in the 31st Ward of the City of Chicago. We're a nonprofit organization dedicated to responding to the needs of the community.

We're a delegate agency of the City of Chicago providing housing services to homeowners, renters, and community members. In addition to that, I serve as an adjunct faculty member at the Department of Sociology at DePaul University teaching courses on housing, race, and gentrification in Chicago. I stand before you today seeking confirmation for my appointment to the Zoning Board of Appeals as an alternate member, and I look forward to talking to all of you.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (18:01 - 18:24)
Okay, so the questions come up in the committee about where Alderman are in front of a Zoning Board case in their ward. They brought substantial opinion and consultation that this particular application might be beneficial or detrimental to their community. How do you feel about how that weighs into your decision-making with the Zoning Board?

[Speaker 11] (18:25 - 18:41)
Sure. The Alderman, just like any other resident of that ward, would have input and say into what happens in their community and in their ward, so we would take their input as any other member of the community into consideration and use that to determine how we would rule on any particular appeal.

[Speaker 1] (18:42 - 19:59)
Well, you know, it's not just that we're just the, just like any other citizen, we've been elected by the majority of residents in our ward, and they expect us to be their representative to make sure that issues, you know, that they deal with every day are addressed at the Zoning Board and given good weight in this. And I know this has been an issue for Aldermen since the 16 years I've been here. You know, the Aldermen live and breathe their communities every day, and oftentimes there's a whole bunch of zoning cases, and there's sometimes a lot of witnesses for a particular thing on for and against.

And I just want you to know, and I know that I can speak for the majority, that we work hard representing our community, and sometimes there are controversial cases. And at the end of the day, we stand in front of our community to lead and not to follow. So I don't know what the case will be, but there's always interesting cases in front of the Zoning Board.

[Speaker 10] (20:00 - 20:11)
Questions from committee members? Just real quick, Mr. Chairman. I mean, you had basically the exact same answer as the person before you.

Were you all scripted to say exactly what you said?

[Speaker 11] (20:11 - 20:54)
No, I think my answer was a little bit different, with all due respect, because I said like any other resident and got in trouble for saying that. No, I mean, I think in all seriousness, our job as the Zoning Board of Appeals is to hear from everyone, right? Anyone that comes to the hearing and has an issue, we have to listen to, right?

And whether that's an alderman, a resident, a business person, it's our job to listen to them and take in their information and then make an informed decision based on what they tell us. So I respect your position as alderman, as being elected officials for your community and for your ward, and that definitely carries and holds weight. But also, it's our job to hear, as it is any elected official's job, to hear from every person, right, and every viewpoint, and then make an informed decision based on our expertise, based on our background, and based on the situation at hand.

[Speaker 10] (20:55 - 21:08)
Okay, great. Well, in your opening statement, you stated that an alderman is just like every other resident in their ward. Was that a misrepresentation of your— I mean, no, it's not.

[Speaker 11] (21:08 - 21:33)
I think an alderman, again, is elected and holds weight, having been elected by the members of their community. But also, I think any individual that stands before the Zoning Board has the ability to and has the right to state their case or claim, no matter who they are. Whether I agree or disagree with them, whether they have a title or not, we should give everyone, every person, the chance to speak and to have their voice heard in public discourse, and I believe that firmly.

[Speaker 10] (21:34 - 22:04)
Okay, great. Well, just understand that an alderman is elected to represent their community, and if they have a voice, that should be the voice, because they are elected by their constituents in their community. And if they're speaking on behalf of their community, that should be because they are elected, so therefore, that is the voice of the community.

And just so you know, an ordinary citizen can't vote for you to be on the Zoning Board of Appeal as an alderman.

[Speaker 1] (22:09 - 22:26)
Okay, I think I've said this. You know, we've got a number of appointees on the Zoning Board, so obviously, I know you're listening, and I really think that sociology degree is going to be really helpful, too, you know, so that we could all understand each other better. Alderman Rodriguez.

[Speaker 63] (22:27 - 23:22)
Thank you, Chairman. I'd like to speak highly of this candidate. I think he brings a unique skill set as a non-profit executive director that's community-based.

Being a community-based non-profit executive director myself in my previous job, we've done a lot of work together. James led a community-wide effort to do neighborhood planning in his community via Le Chicago. It's a program that I helped mentor their community in, and they brought me in to talk about the plans that we did in Little Village.

I was very impressed with the process. I wasn't involved with it day-to-day, but I know that you were a steward of community engagements. My understanding, there was hundreds of people engaged in that process.

That's the type of experience I think we need on this commission, and I'm happy that you represent that type of experience coming in. You'll be having my support.

[Speaker 47] (23:24 - 24:06)
Thank you, Alderman. Alderman Varavoyas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I've worked very closely with James Riddick in the last few years, and he's done a wonderful job on the northwest side, the Belmont-Craigan area. In fact, they put together a Belmont-Craigan plan of action that they're using, and it's unbelievable. It carries a lot of weight in the ward.

It has housing. It has community organizations involved, and it's for the best of the area. So it also involves the 36th Ward, 29th Ward, 31st Ward, 35th Ward, and the 30th Ward, and I highly recommend this individual for the ZBA.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (24:06 - 24:09)
Thank you, Alderman. Any other comments? Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 4] (24:12 - 25:02)
Thank you, Chairman. You're a professor, correct? Adjunct professor?

Yeah. Gentrification, and from what I'm looking at, focus on the foreclosure crisis as well as African American studies? Correct.

I've also heard you say that your views on how you plan on taking your role and our concerns about our communities and things of that nature. Do you think that you are coming into this with an, forgive the expression, but an over-educated viewpoint to look at certain neighborhoods that might come off as biased towards the elected officials who actually are from those neighborhoods?

[Speaker 11] (25:03 - 25:42)
Is that a bias that is there? Absolutely not. Really?

Yeah. In my work at DePaul, I look at gentrification across the city of Chicago and across the United States, so it's not specific to any one neighborhood. In my work at the Northwest Side Housing Center, we represent the Northwest Side.

As Alderman Roboira said, it's the 29th, 30th, 31st, 35th, 36th, 39th, 38th, 45th wards, so that's a large chunk of the city, not any one specific individual. And as Alderman Rodriguez mentioned, we work as part of a citywide coalition throughout the entire city of Chicago with other individuals and other wards that we don't represent or work with directly.

[Speaker 4] (25:43 - 26:27)
So your views on areas that are changing, particularly in the South and West Sides, areas where probably most of the development that are going to happen, how do you see those gentrifying forces? I don't think I can comment. Because my concern is that putting people on this body that are going to come in with their own mindset to try and bring their social justice warrior activism to my neighborhood, when we've seen time and again how the interactions with university-type individuals try to impose their views on neighborhoods as opposed to listening to the views of the neighborhood.

[Speaker 11] (26:27 - 26:53)
And it gives me great pause, especially listening to you this morning. I appreciate the comment. It's not—two things.

One, I think in an elected role, it's not our job to bring our own personal opinions to the table. So whether or not I agree or disagree with a certain individual— Appointed. Yeah, any elected-appointed position, I believe that it's not our job to bring my own personal views to the table.

[Speaker 4] (26:53 - 26:59)
So whether or not I have— Well, actually, you are there because of your personal views. You are there because of your resume.

[Speaker 11] (27:00 - 27:40)
So I'm just trying to get— My resume is different than my individual viewpoint. So if I have a certain opinion about a certain neighborhood or individual, that doesn't weigh into the decision-making of a particular project or a particular property or a particular zoning issue at hand. And then secondly, I appreciate your comments about concern about making decisions for others or for neighborhoods.

That's why we do the work that we do on the Northwest side. We make decisions in the community by the community. So it's not of my opinion that anyone should be making decisions for individuals that don't live or represent that community.

So I'll take into account every individual within that community's input into a particular project. Okay. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (27:41 - 27:41)
Other questions?

[Speaker 22] (27:41 - 27:58)
Alderman Waguespay. Thank you, Chairman. And this will be just a heads-up.

It'll be a question for Plan Commission to point these to. But does your organization receive any city, state, or federal funds for any administration or project?

[Speaker 11] (28:01 - 28:01)
Oh, no.

[Speaker 22] (28:03 - 28:06)
Administrative, overhead, staffing, anything like that.

[Speaker 11] (28:06 - 28:31)
So, yes, we're a HUD-certified housing counseling agency. So we receive funding from HUD. We receive funding from the state of Illinois through the Illinois Housing Development Authority.

And we receive funding from the city of Chicago through the Department of Planning and Development as a delegate agency to provide foreclosure prevention counseling to individuals at risk of losing their home. We have the highest success rate in the state of Illinois, one of the highest in the country, helping 86 out of 100 homeowners save their home from foreclosure.

[Speaker 22] (28:32 - 28:36)
So if there's a conflict of interest that arises before the ZBA, how would you handle that?

[Speaker 11] (28:37 - 28:45)
Yeah, I'd have to recuse myself from voting on any matters related to anything pertaining to our contract with the city regarding foreclosure prevention.

[Speaker 22] (28:46 - 28:48)
Prior to any discussions?

[Speaker 34] (28:49 - 28:50)
Correct.

[Speaker 22] (28:51 - 29:05)
And then, as you're coming onto the board as, I guess, an alternate member, but have you looked at the procedures of the ZBA and thought about any ways to improve the procedures or the practices?

[Speaker 11] (29:06 - 29:12)
To date, not yet. That'll be forthcoming if I am appointed today.

[Speaker 22] (29:13 - 29:14)
Thank you. That's all I have.

[Speaker 1] (29:16 - 29:17)
Great. Paula Mindell.

[Speaker 30] (29:19 - 29:52)
Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Alderman Lopez mentioned that you have looked at, I mean, you're a professor, right?

And you've done a lot of study about gentrification across the United States. Do you have a particular perspective on the development of commercial corridors? And how would you approach the development of commercial corridors in low-income communities and also communities that are undergoing pressures of gentrification?

[Speaker 11] (29:54 - 30:19)
Thank you for the question. My research focuses on housing, not on commercial corridors, yet I realize that they're closely linked and related and that what happens in housing and happens in businesses impact one another. But the research I've done is more on housing prices and how changes in rents and housing prices impact neighborhoods based on the housing market and housing values.

So I have a particular opinion on commercial corridors.

[Speaker 30] (30:20 - 30:47)
So I'll just throw this example out to you and see, on a particular commercial corridor, you have a number of, you have maybe a couple of beauty salons and a barber salon, a barber shop, and you get a special use permit for an additional one. How do you think through, knowing that we want to have more commerce in the city of Chicago, more tax revenue? How do you look at that particular corridor?

[Speaker 11] (30:49 - 31:08)
It's a great question. I would defer to yourself, the alderman, and the residents of the community, the current business owners, and those that are impacted by the addition of the new salon or barber shop to hear their opinion and whether or not they think it would be beneficial for the community and whether or not you think it would help boost the commercial corridor if you think it may be a hindrance based on the type of business.

[Speaker 30] (31:10 - 31:15)
That's an excellent answer, given your previous answer. So thank you. Thank you, Alderman Dowell.

[Speaker 1] (31:16 - 31:18)
Other questions? Alderman Cardona?

[Speaker 50] (31:20 - 31:48)
Well, first of all, I want to thank you, Chairman, and thank you, James, for being here and being appointed. I know James, for over six months, has been working diligently in the community. Northwest Housing is in my ward, 31st Ward, and him being in that leadership program has moved our ward in a great way.

And I approve his appointment today, and I support him today in this appointment.

[Speaker 1] (31:49 - 31:57)
All right. Hearing no other questions, I'm going to ask for a motion for the—oh, I'm sorry. Who am I missing?

I'm sorry.

[Speaker 50] (31:59 - 32:00)
Alderman Austin?

[Speaker 42] (32:10 - 32:13)
Yes, ma'am. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My apologies, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (32:13 - 32:13)
Harry.

[Speaker 42] (32:14 - 33:08)
Well, I don't know James. This is my first time in even meeting or hearing of James. But with all of the questions that have been asked by my colleagues, I think that you answered them in a very strategic way to inform them that you would be fair in your decision-making.

One, when you stated that you would not bring your personal opinion in, you would bring your professional opinion in. And I think that that is something that I wanted to hear. When Alderman Wagesbeck asked you about your funding, you didn't try to dodge the question.

And that was what was important for me to know that. You do receive funds from various state, city organizations, and you didn't duck it. So for me, I think that that says something about your character.

So I am very supportive of you becoming one of our Zoning Board of Appeals members. Thank you. Thank you, Alderman Austin.

[Speaker 17] (33:08 - 33:09)
I'm going to make everybody a president.

[Speaker 1] (33:10 - 33:59)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So let's ask for a motion pass on the appointment of James Rudak to the Zoning Board of Appeals. So moved by Alderman Roboyas.

All those in favor? And any opposed? Is there some no's?

Wait a second. Hold on a second. Who would like to be David Moore and Alderman Lopez?

No on the appointment. All right. See where that sociology degree is going to come in real handy.

We look forward to working with you. And we have all those opposed. And in the opinion to share the ayes, have it.

And we'll report it out. Thank you very much.

[Speaker 11] (33:59 - 34:00)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (34:01 - 34:16)
Moving on. Mayoral appointment 1912, the appointment of Jolene Saul. As a member of the Zoning Board of Appeals for the term effective immediately and expiring on July 1st, 2020, to complete the unexpired term of Amanda Williams, who has resigned.

[Speaker 56] (34:19 - 35:16)
Jolene, good morning. Good morning. Thank you, Chairman Toney and members of the committee.

My name is Jolene Saul, and I come before the committee this morning seeking confirmation for my appointment to the Zoning Board of Appeals. I'm a resident of the Third Ward, and I'm currently a vice president at Brinshore Development, a national developer of affordable and mixed income housing. In my role, I oversee all aspects of the development process from conception to construction completion.

Having worked in both the public and private sectors, I've spent my career working to increase opportunity and access for minority and low income communities through health policy, economic development, and housing. Zoning is an important tool that guides the city's development and is key to creating and maintaining vibrant communities and fostering economic development. I look forward to serving the city in this role, and I'm available for any questions.

Thank you for your time.

[Speaker 1] (35:17 - 35:26)
And thank you, Jolene. Questions from committee members. So the question by Alderman Beal, why don't you repeat the question?

[Speaker 10] (35:28 - 35:35)
Good morning. Just wondering what your opinion is as far as automatic prerogative as it relates to issues that come before the Zoning Board of Appeals.

[Speaker 56] (35:36 - 35:52)
Sure. As elected officials representing their wards, aldermen have a unique and a depth of knowledge of their ward and the interests of their constituents. I would take that into consideration as I consider cases before the Zoning Board of Appeals.

[Speaker 10] (35:53 - 35:55)
Do you believe that aldermen are the voice of their community?

[Speaker 56] (35:56 - 35:58)
I think they are elected to represent their community.

[Speaker 10] (36:00 - 36:02)
Do you believe the alderman is the voice of their community?

[Speaker 56] (36:03 - 36:05)
I think they represent the...

[Speaker 10] (36:07 - 36:09)
Not a trick question.

[Speaker 56] (36:09 - 36:15)
My answer is the same. So I think they are elected to represent their community and voice the concerns of their constituents.

[Speaker 22] (36:16 - 36:37)
Questions? Alderman Wagesby. Thank you, Chairman.

Good morning. If there's a conflict of interest, would you recuse yourself before you had discussions? Absolutely.

And as you move forward, if you have any ideas about practical procedures that can be improved, would you share them with everyone?

[Speaker 30] (36:38 - 36:40)
I would raise that with staff and anyone else. Yeah.

[Speaker 22] (36:41 - 36:44)
I have, Chairman. Thank you. Great.

Okay. Alderman Dowell.

[Speaker 30] (36:47 - 37:18)
I just learned you were a resident of the third ward. But I would like to weigh in on this appointment. I have met Ms. Saul and have worked briefly with her in her role at Brenshaw. I found her to be very thoughtful, very balanced in her approach to community development and housing development in our area. And I think that she would be an excellent appointment addition to the ZBA. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (37:20 - 37:31)
Okay, seeing no more comments, can I have a motion for the appointment of Jolene Saul as a member of the Zoning Board of Appeals? Alderman Riley moves. All those in favor?

[Speaker 6] (37:32 - 37:33)
Any opposed?

[Speaker 1] (37:34 - 38:07)
Continue to the chair. The ayes have it. And welcome to the team.

All right. Next, we have Mayoral Appointment 1913, appointment of Teresa Cordova as a member of the Chicago Plan Commission for a term effective immediately and expiring on January 25, 2022 to complete the unexpired term of Martin Cabrera, who has resigned. Teresa, good morning.

[Speaker 16] (38:07 - 38:08)
Good morning.

[Speaker 1] (38:08 - 38:18)
So you've been witnessing some of this, but this is the Plan Commission, a little different job description. So welcome and please proceed.

[Speaker 16] (38:18 - 39:22)
Thank you very much, Chairman Tunney. Chairman Tunney and members of the committee, my name is Teresa Cordova, and I'm very honored to appear before you seeking confirmation for my appointment to the Chicago Plan Commission. I am a professor of urban planning and policy and director of UIC's Great Cities Institute.

For all of my career, I have been interested in equitable and sustainable community development. My civic life, as partially described in the bio that you have in front of you, demonstrates this commitment. I am interested in a holistic approach to the development of all parts of the city, including neighborhoods.

What I hope to bring to the table is a transparency in development decisions by bringing to bear on our decisions the voices of multiple stakeholders whose lives are affected by those decisions. You can count on me to work hard and bring the best of my decades of knowledge and experience to decision making of the commission. Thank you, and I'm very happy to answer any of your questions.

[Speaker 1] (39:23 - 39:28)
And thank you. Questions? We'll start with David Moore.

Alderman Moore.

[Speaker 25] (39:29 - 40:04)
Thank you, Chairman. I don't have any questions. It's just that I am just honored.

Teresa is going to be an asset to us, really, more than anything, for her to be on the committee. Her voice throughout this community, anytime I attended any forums, have always been fair, one that sought to put neighborhood communities first. And I've always respected your voice in this sphere.

So I'm just honored to have you on this committee. You're going to be a total asset to the city of Chicago. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (40:07 - 40:08)
Alderman Cecil Lopez.

[Speaker 17] (40:09 - 41:10)
Thank you, Chair. I also want to echo some of the comments of Alderman Moore. I had the pleasure to know Teresa.

She's, in fact, one of the first academics that reached out when we continued to address some of the issues of displacement and the affordable housing crisis we have in the city. So it's good, and I think it's encouraging to see more women of color in these positions first. And also, it's important to have academics that are actually working on the ground.

So, yeah, there are scholars and scholars. I'd like to see more academic scholar activists that care and deeply care about the community, that show with their actions and the policy that we can have a different approach. So I hope that we can continue working together.

And the quick question I may have, if you maybe can share with me, what is your vision under the new position? What do you envision now under this potential new role?

[Speaker 16] (41:12 - 42:15)
Mr. Chairman, Alderman Cicholopas, thank you very much. And thank you, Alderman Moore. I really appreciate it, and I'm deeply moved by it.

The role of the Plan Commission, thank you so much. The role of the Plan Commission is to look at plan developments and also to look at lakefront development. So to that extent, it's very specific.

But I think what becomes really important is that there are opportunities throughout the entire process for input. Developers want the certainty. They don't want to have to get to the end of the process and then have things come up at the end.

And I think the extent to which we can incorporate more voices early on and throughout the process as we work through this particulars of the development proposal, I think is important. And I think looking at the criteria and making sure that the criteria by which we are obligated to make decisions reflect the various concerns of the multiple stakeholders.

[Speaker 1] (42:18 - 42:19)
Alderman Hatton.

[Speaker 16] (42:22 - 42:24)
Hello and welcome. Congratulations on your appointment.

[Speaker 35] (42:25 - 43:03)
Similar to what Alderman Moore and Alderman Cicholopas had to say, I just want to share in my personal working experience with you, but also, I mean, we can look at your resume, right? You've got the breadth of experience both within the public sector, right? And all the ways that we work with the non-profit sector and the private sector.

And especially, you know, I think I've experienced and watched your work and how you have centered marginalized voices, your focus on participatory planning processes, that I think is going to be a great asset to this commission. So thank you for accepting the appointment.

[Speaker 16] (43:05 - 43:06)
Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (43:06 - 43:13)
Alderman Locke. Hold on a second. Are you finished?

Then I'm going to move Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 4] (43:16 - 44:33)
Thank you, Chairman. Teresa, you know, we've had a chance to work together. I've seen you in action in back of the yards with your neighborhood plan.

And I've seen how you try to interact with the neighborhoods, try to balance everyone's desire to give their input. I would have just one word of caution where you're going. That has to be tempered with a focus for the end result, which is to continue to improve and build this great city.

Sometimes, as I remember some of our meetings, it would get quite chaotic trying to accommodate everyone to give them a voice. Amazingly chaotic. And I think in our effort to try to be inclusive, we also run the risk sometimes of being unable to accomplish anything.

So I would just offer that cautionary note, because I think that I know your skill set, and I know where your heart is, but on the planning commission, passion with focus.

[Speaker 65] (44:33 - 44:34)
Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 16] (44:35 - 45:18)
Chairman Tony and Alderman Lopez, thank you very much. You're right. Some of those early meetings were difficult because of the various voices and the sentiments that they expressed.

But one of the things that was very important about that process is we continue to work with various community stakeholders, dividing them into subcommittees. And the net result was a neighborhood plan that I think did represent a lot of the voices in that. And I think provides for the community an opportunity to use that plan to continue to work with you, for example, to move forward on some of their vision.

Thank you. I appreciate that very much. Thank you, Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 1] (45:18 - 45:19)
Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 2] (45:20 - 47:04)
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I would be remiss if I did not commend this young lady, but also the other ones who have come before her and also the mayor on these appointments. And, you know, I think it's a breath of fresh air to see so many affordable housing developers or people who have been associated with affordable housing coming on to the board.

In the past, generally, we had a lot of architects that was on the Zoning Board of Appeals. So this is different. These are actual people, not that the architects didn't have experience with development, but folks who were affected by development outside of architects.

So I think this is great. And being in the affordable, seeing the affordable things, I think it gives you all experience of seeing where you can see bias, you know, in different areas in relationship to development. So it's good to have folks who have experienced those type of biases dealing with development and having a broad context of how people deal with different things and their fears and what have you, but knowing actually what happens.

And I'm going to tell you, I haven't seen anyone with this much experience. You have been everywhere. My God, when do you have time to sleep, you know?

So I just commend you for taking on another civic task for free. I commend you for taking this on. So I just want to say thank you.

Thank you.

[Speaker 16] (47:04 - 47:08)
I really appreciate that. Alderman La Spada.

[Speaker 12] (47:10 - 48:10)
Yes, thank you so much, Chair. Just had to take a moment as a member of the UIC community to speak to your appointment. It was my experience with the Great Cities Institute's Civic Leadership Training Program that first really opened my policy imagination, made me believe this could be a path that I would walk down, and I am still grateful to have had that experience five years ago.

But I'm even more than impressed by your commitment to participatory planning, because it is true, like participation is messy. It's uncomfortable. Unilateral decision-making is a lot cleaner, and I think that's why so many planners have preferred it in the past.

But that's not where we're going. We're going towards a planned commission that is more equitable, that is more participatory and civic-minded. And so I'm really glad to see your leadership on that commission.

[Speaker 50] (48:11 - 48:14)
Thank you. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (48:15 - 49:00)
All right, so questions comes up. I've been on the planned commission a number of years, and there is a criticism, I would say, rubber stamp. You've been on a planned commission before.

How do you, obviously, we're all listening to the evidence in the presentation and such. I think there needs to be more, as Alderman Burnett said, just more outspokenness about the individual developments and such. But as we talked about the Zoning Board of Appeals, if you feel, how do you feel when you're opposing the administration on a particular project?

[Speaker 16] (49:04 - 49:42)
Well, I think, first of all, it's the criteria that we have to look at, right? And I think the process is an important part of what will lead up to the point where it reaches us when we have to make a decision. So I think the extent to which that process enables input, not only from various stakeholders, from staff, various city agencies, from aldermen, alderwomen, so I think the extent to which that process enables the input, I think we end up with a better decision.

[Speaker 1] (49:46 - 49:52)
I see you. Obviously, well, let's ask, what ward, what community area?

[Speaker 16] (49:52 - 49:56)
27. Alderman Burnett is my alderman. All right.

[Speaker 1] (49:57 - 49:58)
I do have a question. I know, right?

[Speaker 17] (49:59 - 50:04)
OK, now that prompted Alderman Villegas to ask a question.

[Speaker 65] (50:04 - 50:05)
All right.

[Speaker 62] (50:06 - 51:07)
Thank you, Chairman. Very excited about this appointment. I know Dr. Cordova for quite some time, and what really excites me is the fact that in her resume and her experience demonstrates economic development, and that's something that's much needed in the city of Chicago. On the Planning Commission, the previous administration had an executive order that talked about 30% MWBE goals, and this administration has carried on with that executive order. And so that's something that, on the Planning Commission, that we're hoping and wanting you to continue that and challenge the developers that the 30% is the floor, is the floor, not the ceiling. So we want to make sure that we're supporting you as a council in identifying those developers that are not getting the message, because that's something that spurs economic development, which is, again, sorely needed in some communities.

So I'm excited to have you on this Planning Commission. I look forward to working with you and seeing what you're going to do for the city of Chicago. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.

[Speaker 16] (51:08 - 51:24)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman Tony and Alderman Villegas. Thank you so much. And I think as part of that economic, I hear you.

And I think also as part of economic development, Alderman Dell mentioned the issue of commercial revitalization. That's another important part of the economic development that I'm very much interested in as well.

[Speaker 1] (51:26 - 51:39)
Okay. Thank you. Hearing, seeing no questions, can I have a motion to pass on the appointment of Teresa Cordova to the Chicago Planning Commission, Alderman Villegas?

Does that? Can I, all those in favor?

[Speaker 65] (51:40 - 51:41)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (51:42 - 51:55)
And any, and any opposed? Hearing none from the Alderman, it's the opinion of the Chair of the Ayes have it. Welcome and look forward to working with you.

[Speaker 16] (51:55 - 51:57)
Thank you so much. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (51:57 - 52:20)
Next. Okay. Mayoral appointment 1915, the appointment of Andre Broomfield as a member of the Chicago Planning Commission for a term effective immediately and expiring on January 25th of 2023 to complete the unexpired term of the late Albert D.

Tyson. Andre.

[Speaker 39] (52:22 - 52:22)
Morning.

[Speaker 1] (52:28 - 52:29)
First chair, sir.

[Speaker 64] (52:32 - 52:32)
Welcome.

[Speaker 9] (52:33 - 52:33)
Morning.

[Speaker 33] (52:35 - 53:43)
Good morning, Chairman. And also good morning members of this committee. My name is Andre Broomfield.

I'm principal in charge of cities and urban design for Gensler Architects based here in Chicago. I come before this committee seeking confirmation for my appointment to the Planning Commission. I am trained as an architect, but focused my career on urban redevelopment, neighborhood revitalization, specific emphasis on affordable housing as an urban designer and urban planner.

Please don't hold this against me, but I'm originally from Milwaukee, but I've called Chicago home and continue to call Chicago home since 1997. And a proud resident of the Fifth Ward. I feel that not only my experience, but more importantly, my passion and my background as it relates to bringing about positive change to our neighborhoods, which I feel I've demonstrated throughout my career, would not only be of an asset to this committee, but to the mayor and also the city as a whole.

So I'm humbled to be considered for appointment for this Planning Commission and I look forward to any questions that you have and ultimately working with you.

[Speaker 65] (53:43 - 53:44)
Great.

[Speaker 1] (53:44 - 53:48)
Questions from committee members. Alderman Beal.

[Speaker 10] (53:49 - 54:09)
Good morning. Based on, you say, your upbringing, your appointment depends on this. What's your favorite football team?

Be real careful. Your favorite, what, baseball team? No, no, no, football.

When you said Milwaukee, I was like...

[Speaker 33] (54:09 - 54:25)
You know, and full disclosure, I felt I had to say where I was from and where my roots are. Let's just say this, that I have two children. Some will argue that I'm raising them the right way here as the Chicago Bears fans, but...

[Speaker 10] (54:25 - 54:25)
Enough said.

[Speaker 33] (54:26 - 54:28)
Let's just say that Sundays can be difficult.

[Speaker 10] (54:28 - 54:29)
Move to pass, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (54:31 - 54:34)
That's a prerogative, isn't it? All right. Alderman Doll.

[Speaker 30] (54:36 - 55:27)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Before I say what I have to say about Mr. Brumfeld, I just want to acknowledge the memory of my friend, Reverend Albert D. Tyson III, whose presence on the Planning Commission will be missed.

But I think that this is an excellent appointment by Mayor Lightfoot to the Planning Commission. I have known Andre for over a decade and can speak to his involvement in the city of Chicago on projects large and small all across the city of Chicago. He has a very creative sensibility when it comes to architecture and working with communities and understanding communities.

And I think that he'll be a great addition on the Planning Commission and ask my colleagues to support this appointment.

[Speaker 1] (55:28 - 55:29)
Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 30] (55:29 - 55:29)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (55:29 - 55:31)
Alderman David Moore.

[Speaker 30] (55:32 - 55:33)
Thank you.

[Speaker 25] (55:33 - 56:06)
I definitely echo those things that Chairman has said. And you've been, Andre, just very involved in the communities, very active. But I just want to know, it's not really a but, it's more like giving you your opportunity as we look to develop the South and the West Sides as a focal point of our mayor.

What are some of the challenges that you see and what are some of the things that you think we should be doing to bring development to the South and the West Sides?

[Speaker 33] (56:08 - 57:05)
I appreciate the question. And also, Alderman Dowell, I appreciate your comments. It starts with, in my opinion, understanding what equitable development really means and what it means for the residents of any given community to basically get access to the components of the quality of life that actually make them not only thrive in their neighborhoods, but also, if you will, find ways to actually pass that opportunity on to the next generation.

So I could take up the next 15 or 20 minutes answering your question. I have a lot of thoughts about it. But again, I would hope that at least a number of the efforts I worked on through my career kind of speak to how we've tried to address that as a whole.

But it really does come down to equitable development opportunities and creating a more balanced city as a whole where everyone wins and everyone can benefit.

[Speaker 25] (57:06 - 57:12)
Thank you so much. And I think your voice from that basis would be a definite asset to this commission. Thank you so much.

[Speaker 2] (57:12 - 58:12)
Thank you, Alderman. Thank you, Alderman. Walter Burnett.

Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I'd also like to concur with my colleagues on everything that was said. We did have an opportunity to work with Andre over at Cabrini Green.

As a matter of fact, he's so engaged that you'd think he's more of a community organizer than an architect, you know, because he cares about the people and what he's doing in the neighborhood. I think I commend the mayor on this appointment. I think it's a great appointment.

Actually, the architectural firm that he works for, you guys are like killing them with all of the awards right now. Ginza is like knocking them out. Batting 100.

Every place I go, you're getting an award. So I think this is a great appointment. I think he will bring great value to Zoning Board of Appeal.

[Speaker 1] (58:13 - 58:18)
Thank you, Alderman. Thank you, Alderman. Alderman Osterman.

[Speaker 37] (58:19 - 59:03)
Thank you. I also support your appointment. Alderman Moore did have a question related to how do we increase economic development on the south and west side?

And I know you can go on and on, but I think the members of this committee would welcome your feedback. So if you want to do an open letter to the chairman that can go to us, we as a city are kind of grappling with that issue and relying on expertise. So I think if you would spend that time and do it whenever you have free time, I think we welcome.

We have a new commissioner in the Department of Planning who's coming from Detroit. And all of us are focused on it. So I think any insight you have, I think I'd welcome.

And if you can get it through the chair, I'd appreciate it. Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 2] (59:03 - 59:11)
Mr. Chairman, just a point of corrections. Alderman Burnett. I think it'd be a great appointment to the Planning Commission.

[Speaker 1] (59:11 - 59:13)
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't hear what you said to the Zoning Board. Okay.

[Speaker 2] (59:14 - 59:16)
All right. Alone with us.

[Speaker 1] (59:16 - 59:41)
Other, no other questions. Then I would have a motion on the appointment of Andre Brumfeld to the Chicago Planning Commission. I hear a motion by Alderman Wagespac.

All those in favor? Any opposed? Then you and the chair of the ayes have it, and we report it out.

Thank you and congratulations. Look forward to working with you.

[Speaker 33] (59:41 - 59:42)
Thank you, Alderman. Thank you, committee.

[Speaker 1] (59:44 - 1:00:16)
Lastly, the mayoral appointment 1916, the appointment of Deborah Moore as a member of the Chicago Planning Commission for a term effective immediately and expiring January 25th of 2024 to succeed Gary Gardner, whose term has expired. Deborah, good morning.

[Speaker 42] (1:00:16 - 1:01:17)
Good morning. Thank you, Chairman Tooney and members of the committee. My name is Deborah Moore, and I come before this committee seeking confirmation for my appointment to the Chicago Planning Commission.

I am honored to have been selected to provide my community development and housing expertise to promote the comprehensive growth and sustainability of this city and its neighborhood. I have worked in community development and housing for over 25 years, serving both the south and west sides of the city. Currently, I serve as the director of Neighborhood Strategy and Neighborhood Housing Services of Chicago, where we promote homeownership as a means to strengthen families and communities, especially in the city's most underserved neighborhoods.

It is my pleasure to serve on the Chicago Planning Commission to help align the priorities and strategies for development so that all communities in our city can become neighborhoods of choice and opportunity. Thank you for your time.

[Speaker 1] (1:01:20 - 1:01:28)
Thank you very much. Questions, Mr. Chairman? David Moore, Alderman Moore.

[Speaker 25] (1:01:29 - 1:02:41)
Thank you. I'm excited about this opportunity because it's sometimes rare that you see people who have really been on the ground, boots on the ground in Inglewood and our progression community appointed to these commissions. And so Deborah has, I've known her for well over, well, 15 years, way before I became an alderman and I was serving the residents of the Inglewood and our progression community.

And Deborah, what I like about her, now she listens to the residents. She has a great relationship with the residents, but she knows how to intertwine that and bring her expertise, as well as that of the leadership throughout the community together to form some ideas that we can help us rebuild our community. She was definitely a voice when the Whole Foods and the other development came up on 63rd Street, as well as other developments throughout the our progression and Inglewood community.

So I definitely thank the mayor for this selection and definitely a person that I totally support and know there's no relation for the record. All right.

[Speaker 28] (1:02:42 - 1:02:43)
Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (1:02:44 - 1:02:49)
Other questions? Did we get what ward you're from?

[Speaker 42] (1:02:49 - 1:02:53)
I'm sorry. I'm currently residing in the 21st ward with family members.

[Speaker 1] (1:02:53 - 1:02:54)
21st ward.

[Speaker 42] (1:02:54 - 1:02:57)
Yeah, Alderman Brookings. Say it again. Alderman Brookings.

Okay.

[Speaker 2] (1:03:00 - 1:03:32)
Mr. Chairman. Yeah. I also would like to commend the mayor on this appointment.

As I said earlier, it's good to have someone with a broad perspective, in particular, dealing with affordable housing. Especially with some of the mandates that the new administration is going to be putting in toward working in the communities on the south and the west side. So it's good to have you on board.

Of course, I'm on the plan commission with you, so I look forward to serving with you.

[Speaker 42] (1:03:32 - 1:03:37)
Thank you, Alderman. I also would like to thank Alderman Moore for support. Great.

[Speaker 1] (1:03:38 - 1:03:55)
Thank you. Hearing no more questions, can I have a motion to move the appointment of Deborah Moore as a member of the Chicago Plan Commission? So moved by Alderman Beal.

All those in favor? Any opposed? Opinion of the chair of the ayes have it.

And welcome aboard.

[Speaker 42] (1:03:55 - 1:03:56)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:03:56 - 1:04:54)
Forward to working with you. All right. Okay.

Now, we are going to move to the public comment period. Okay. So, let's see.

We're going to move public comment period. Out of respect for everyone's time, each speaker is limited to four minutes to address all items on the agenda. All items on the agenda.

In the beginning, this will be the only opportunity to address these items on the agenda, and the committee will not conduct separate public comment before each agenda item. And also, I wanted to say we're going to have a little more technology at this meeting. Now, we're going to be having the plans and we're going to be using the screen for the presentation.

So hopefully, we'll get through this. Don't blame me if we don't. Blame staff.

[Speaker 18] (1:04:54 - 1:04:54)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:57 - 1:05:04)
So, let's see. We're going to start. Okay.

Let's start with Mr. Blakemore.

[Speaker 23] (1:05:07 - 1:08:36)
Let's start with Mr. Blakemore. I'm appalled. These appointees that you had a few moments ago, the citizens had a right to give their opinion and vote.

Every item up here on the agenda, the citizens have a right to comment. Oh, what do you call yourself doing? Who do you call?

Who are you? You work for the police. Just public comment.

We all are entitled to speak on each item. This is not legal you're doing. If I wanted to oppose these people for zoning board of appeal, and I've been to many, many, many, many of these meetings, how corrupt and the process.

I wasn't given a chance. When these other folks are sitting around, do you know what's happening? That means you're going to have to come up and speak on these items all at one time.

Are you educated people? Or are y'all uninformed, unenlightened, unengaged with government? This is a shame what's going on here.

And oh, fake media. Show me and write about me what I say. We are entitled to, as citizens, to speak on all these items.

You have approved these upon ease. I should have had a chance, excuse me, and every citizen should have a chance to say, I agree, or I oppose, or I'm for these appointees. These appointees and reappointees.

So again, the reason we have bad leadership, what went on with Burke or Shalik Trinala is because of you people, y'all, who put these hacks in. These black political hacks, these white political hacks, these Hispanic political hacks, these prostitutes, political prostitutes. Do you know what he said?

He has changed the rules to benefit him. He do not want to hear from the public on these items. So those who have a history of coming to Golden Gorge, you know that never went on in our great city, what he's doing here.

With the approval of you other hacks, denying the public the right to speak on these appointees and these items. Say, you can only speak five minutes on maybe 30 items. If you don't want to listen, then you first.

You hear me, y'all? If you don't want to speak, you don't need me, y'all. And some of those people, y'all, are hacks.

Nothing but hacks. So I'm just grateful. All of y'all.

And all of y'all are just grateful.

[Speaker 1] (1:08:36 - 1:08:42)
All right. Yes, Alderman Beal.

[Speaker 10] (1:08:42 - 1:09:11)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, where, you know, I don't totally agree with the antics in which Mr. Blakemore has portrayed, but I think he has a valid point as it relates to each item that is presented before this body and that the public does have an opportunity to speak on each item before they are voted on. And so, again, I just want to state for the record that I don't agree with his antics.

However, I do believe he has a valid point. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:09:12 - 1:09:15)
I appreciate that, Alderman. Alderman Brian Hopkins.

[Speaker 48] (1:09:17 - 1:09:57)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would only point out that there's a variety of ways to provide input to us as aldermen. Speaking during a public hearing is merely one, and it's probably not the best.

It certainly isn't the most effective because we're poised to take action. My office, like I think most of my colleagues, is open to input, phone calls, emails, personal meetings. You know, there's a variety of channels for the public to provide input on matters before this committee and others.

And speaking on the day of for your three minutes or five minutes is probably the least effective of all of them.

[Speaker 1] (1:09:59 - 1:10:43)
Thank you, Alderman. And just for edification, our agenda is out 15 days prior to the meeting. We receive all sorts of communication, phone, email, et cetera, on items.

So it is. And for the record, when Mr. Blakemore signed up for mayoral appointment 1909 and 1910, those appointments were already approved. So he was a little late to the game.

Thank you, Mr. Next, Kimberly Dion. Kimberly, Kimberly, good morning.

[Speaker 32] (1:10:44 - 1:11:09)
That's a lot to follow. Good morning. I'm a current resident of the one superior place.

And I'm here in support of the amendment to allow for more short term rental guest suites at my building. I believe this is agenda number 59 or number 20119. Oh, wait, wait, I'm sorry.

Those were the only ones to the appointment.

[Speaker 18] (1:11:10 - 1:11:12)
These are just regular public testimony.

[Speaker 1] (1:11:12 - 1:11:19)
Yeah, this is public testimony. We're finished with the appointments for the public comment period for all zoning items. And you're referring to which zoning item?

[Speaker 32] (1:11:21 - 1:11:29)
20119 is the one west superior. Is that correct? 20119.

I'm on page 22.

[Speaker 1] (1:11:33 - 1:11:36)
Okay. So make sure that we're all on the page, please.

[Speaker 35] (1:11:44 - 1:11:48)
Okay. Oh, nevermind.

[Speaker 32] (1:11:49 - 1:11:49)
Yeah.

[Speaker 1] (1:11:51 - 1:11:57)
So it is not being deferred. So it is happening. Okay.

I'm sorry. We're going to continue, please.

[Speaker 32] (1:11:57 - 1:13:14)
Okay, not a problem. Again, I'm in current residence at one west superior. At first, I was skeptical of the idea of having more short term rentals and guest suites.

I was concerned about safety and security. I visited one of the CASA meetings last month and was impressed by the thoroughness of their safety procedures. They clearly care about the community.

And I'm confident that they will take proper steps to bring service to our building in a responsible and thoughtful way. I'm looking forward to using this short stay option when my friends and family come to visit, especially like the discount for residences. Discounts are always appreciated.

I know I am not alone in my support for CASA at one superior. There are many other residents I have spoken with that are also excited about the convenience, having family and friends staying under our roof, but not in our apartment. I wanted to make sure that my and other supported residents' voices are heard at today's meeting.

Thank you so much for your time and your consideration.

[Speaker 1] (1:13:15 - 1:13:44)
Thank you, Kimberly. Next, Jordan Chancer, same item. Jordan is in favor of the item 20119, which is the one we're talking about right now in Superior.

Jordan, for the record, he's in support. Next is Sarah Doherty. And our same number is Sarah here.

Come on down.

[Speaker 38] (1:13:57 - 1:16:11)
Hi, my name is Sarah Doherty. Thanks so much for giving me the opportunity to speak today. I'm a longtime resident of downtown Chicago where I've built my business and am building my life with my fiancee.

I love our city and love to share it with my out-of-town family, friends, and colleagues. I wanted to speak in support of allowing short-term stays, similar to the speaker before me, to a property on our community, One Superior Place, application number 20119. I'd like to support it for many reasons, among them that this is a type of accommodation our city needs for both business and touristic purposes, I believe.

Additionally, I believe it has the capability to create additional tax revenue to address our projected 2020 budget deficit of $838 million. When my businesses, colleagues, and partners come to advance our work here in the city for periods of a week or more, we often have trouble providing adequate places to stay that are professionally maintained while helping them feel at home. Similarly, when my family comes to visit and we all want a little space, especially for friends of mine that are growing their families and need support from grandma and grandpa but don't necessarily have space for them in their own home, providing a space that's comfortable, that helps them feel at home is hard to come by.

And I believe spaces like the one proposed in One West Superior could resolve that issue without the disruption and inconvenience of construction, which is certainly an issue in our community. Also, as an individual invested in the economic future of our city, the significant occupancy tax that this will generate also matters. As our mayor shared in her State of the City address just over a week ago, our city's budget deficit needs innovative, revenue-generating ways that we can sort of get tax revenue.

And I think this zoning adjustment could provide that. This is a way to provide significant revenue without additional building. I'm excited about the opportunity that this type of accommodation can bring our community, friends and family and colleagues that visit us and that also can provide for a sustainable economic future for our city.

Thanks so much for considering this and for having me here today.

[Speaker 1] (1:16:11 - 1:16:30)
Thank you very much. All right, next speaker will be Annette Britton. Annette, are you here?

And just when you come up to the mic, I know you're opposed, but I don't know what you're opposed to because I don't have an application number. Come on down.

[Speaker 32] (1:16:31 - 1:16:32)
Come on down.

[Speaker 1] (1:16:35 - 1:16:47)
Okay. Well, okay. Annette, hold on one second.

Are we going to hold that now? Okay. Okay, come on down.

This is, I'm assuming it's the Kinsey Corridor now.

[Speaker 20] (1:16:48 - 1:16:49)
Kinsey Corridor, MA-1908.

[Speaker 1] (1:16:50 - 1:16:50)
Yes, ma'am.

[Speaker 20] (1:16:51 - 1:16:51)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:16:51 - 1:17:07)
So we're going to have, we have plenty of speakers on both for and against this. So let's try not to be redundant. We've got a long agenda today and we really expect you coming down and we're going to probably move that up very up to the front of the agenda.

Okay.

[Speaker 20] (1:17:07 - 1:17:08)
So we may speak now or no?

[Speaker 1] (1:17:08 - 1:17:09)
Speak now.

[Speaker 20] (1:17:09 - 1:20:57)
Okay. So my name is Annette Britton and my family has lived on the west side for over 50 years. My extended family, nearly 100.

So let me be clear. This is who I'm here for. Those residents who have deep and long roots on the west side.

And for 50 years, I have seen the same unfortunate blighted conditions and vacant lots in the Kinsey Corridor. My first home was at 2639 West Lake Street at the southwest corner of Lake and Tallman. That same vacant lot has been there since I was a child.

Mayor Lightfoot has promised to bring more economic development and jobs to the west side than ever before. She promised to focus on the west side and to work with us. But today we are faced with the shocking proposal from the planning department that takes the west side economic development in the exact opposite direction.

Instead of asking us about the Kinsey Corridor's future, because make no mistake, it is part and parcel to the larger west side community. The city has held no west side meetings with residents. We're being told that some business opportunities will in fact be taken away.

Instead of helping us gain more goods and services for our families and communities, the city is proposing less goods and services. I object and I call on this committee not to approve the PMD because west side residents have not been consulted or involved. In fact, we've been systematically excluded from the process and attend meetings as uninvited guests.

And city planners haven't explained their ideals to us, period. We demand to meet with the mayor and her new planning commissioner. We demand that you halt this plan before it is fast-tracked.

After 21 years of the PMD and over 50 years of blight on the west side, there's no rush to approve this misguided plan overnight without reasonable community input. If a west side resident wants to work in a factory or distribution center in the PMD, that's fine. But what about a resident who wants to open a medical office, yoga, exercise, or daycare?

Why are we being blocked? What about a resident who wants services along Lake Street from California to Damon, services that are also needed by people who are working in the corridor? Where is the proof that commercial companies are hurting industrial firms so we must eliminate them?

For these questions, we need evidence. This proposal doesn't address the real issue of the Kinsey Corridor as part of the larger west side community. Why are there vacant properties and what is the city doing about it?

What are the obstacles to companies hiring west side residents and what is the city doing about it? What is the city doing about helping west side residents open new and sustainable businesses instead of taking opportunities away? Lemire has said this is a specific priority.

So this plan must tell us specifically how this plan will impact and benefit our community. Meanwhile, our city faces historic budget deficits and residential property taxes will likely increase because we're not gaining enough revenue from taxes. Hang on.

Yeah, we're just not gaining enough revenue from new businesses and taxes. So why in the world would we eliminate business opportunities in the Kinsey Corridor, which is a central part of our larger west side community? Please allow west side residents to work with businesses, Mayor Lightfoot and her new planning commissioner.

Please table this proposal today and allow a genuine public planning process. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:20:58 - 1:21:24)
Thank you, Annette. Now, Kelly Lennox and followed by John K-U-Y-P-R. Okay, so can we get the next two and then we'll follow with people in favor.

Okay, Kelly.

[Speaker 14] (1:21:24 - 1:25:49)
Hi, and thank you. While it says I am opposed, I am opposed to the proposal in its current rendition. I am here to speak on the agenda number MA-1908.

I'm here representing my company, Wright Auction House. We are at 1440 West Hubbard Street. We have been in the PMD for 20 years.

We own the property in which we operate, 60,000 square feet adjacent to multiple residences on Grand Avenue and just to the east of us along Ogden Street and Noble. We have seen the area change over the last 20 years and we are eager to see the PMD revised for the 21st century. Today, I want to say that I am for a new proposal for the corridor, but I don't agree with all of the recommendations in the current proposal being offered today.

And I'm asking to delay the vote on this proposed ordinance so more community involvement can contribute to the overall plan. As a property owner and a business owner in the PMD, we were not a made aware of the revised proposal before it was published in April. And to my knowledge, there was one, maybe two public hearings subsequent to that to hear community input on the proposal.

We have appealed to Alderman Burnett, who sits on this committee and has told us he would work to allow for this postponement for more community involvement. And also with Alderman LaSpada of the First Ward, who has many residents in the area on the east end of the corridor. While I said I agree with many of the recommendations in the proposal, we appreciate the work that the planning department has done in this effort.

But what we respectfully disagree with is the retention of the PMD in the east end of the PMD district between Ogden and Ashland and Grand and Lake. We would like to allow this area to experience the same economic development that has been allowed to occur in the area immediately to our east in the Fulton Market area where the PMD was lifted. This area between Ogden and Ashland is perfect for new and existing businesses to provide badly needed commercial services to the businesses of the PMD to the west and to the residents and workers within.

There are many existing businesses that fit the PMD industrial profile in this area and they want their businesses to remain and co-exist with our residents and allow for a diverse economic development. There is majority support for lifting the PMD in this area by residents and industry businesses alike. The makeup of this area is considerably different than that of the rest of the PMD that is west of Ashland.

As for the area west of Ashland, I would like to state my opposition to the restriction of the businesses that are currently permitted in the PMD. Medical clinics, immediate care and chiropractic and dialysis, daycare, pet daycare and personal training services that are all allowed now and grocery stores which are allowed are only small convenience store of the small convenience store variety. Large grocery stores that are bigger are not allowed and we have thousands and thousands of residents in our immediate vicinity in this area.

The corridor should be a place where existing and new businesses are able to attract and retain workers that have normal services in walkable proximity to their workplace. We want makers. We want industry.

We want blue-collar jobs to remain but we want existing and we want existing businesses in the corridor to grow and expand without restriction. Currently, property owners cannot expand or grow. Why don't you finish the thought?

We are not allowed. Current businesses within the corridor cannot. They're restricted in their growth.

We can't build buildings up. There's a three-story limit. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:25:49 - 1:25:56)
Thank you, Kelly. All right. Next, John Kuyper.

Did I pronounce that right, sir?

[Speaker 34] (1:25:56 - 1:28:24)
Thank you, Kuyper. Okay, great. Thank you for the opportunity to speak before the committee.

I'm also speaking to Mayoral Application 1908. So I am a resident of the 27th Ward. I live in the Noble Hubbard District, we start to call it and my wife and I are signers on a petition to Alderman Burnett to halt the moving forward of this PMD revision, I guess I would call.

So our Noble Hubbard community is asking you to allow us to work with Maurice Cox, Mayor's new Planning Commissioner to establish a collaborative working relationship between the residents and the city. The current proposal, the public input has been ignored. For the first time on August 13th, we learned that the proposal would ban parks in our area, allow large sized restaurants on neighborhood streets, allow nightclubs and shooting ranges to apply to come into our neighborhood.

We respectfully do not agree. We feel a better use of the area would be expansion of residential development and services to support that demographic, including grocery stores. It has been suggested by community organizations that full PMD repeal would be the most beneficial to the area, allowing the urban expansion that has occurred east of Ogden, like Kelly referred to, to expand westward.

Planning Department's response is not only to retain the PMD, but to further restrict economic growth, except for large restaurants, nightclubs and gun ranges that I just previously mentioned. All we're asking as residents is a seat at the table. Thank you.

Many of us have deep roots in the community, continue to stay involved locally as family and neighbors. And by the way, we pay a ton of taxes. We cherish the city as our home.

We want to do what's right for all and not just a select few. I sincerely appreciate the consideration to delay today's vote so that a more robust relationship between the community and the city can be built. Thank you again for allowing me to speak.

Thank you to the mayor. Thank you to Alderman Burnett, although I think he's left the room. Case in point.

Thank you. Great. I know that the Alderman had a short committee meeting.

[Speaker 1] (1:28:25 - 1:29:03)
I know he is in the area. Next, I'm going to call the following three witnesses. These are in favor of this mayoral application 1908.

They are David Avery, or A-V-R-A-M, maybe, Kelly Deedy, and John Hall. Okay, David. Okay.

[Speaker 26] (1:29:04 - 1:29:04)
Good morning.

[Speaker 1] (1:29:05 - 1:29:05)
Good morning, sir.

[Speaker 26] (1:29:06 - 1:32:12)
I'm David Abram, CEO of Great Central Brewing Company, located at 221 Northwood Street here in Chicago. I'm here today to express my support for the amendment to the Municipal Code Title 17 regarding PMD District 4, Agenda Number 1908. I'm in favor of the changes proposed by the DPD to PMD 4.

If not but for the PMD and support from the City of Chicago's Development Fund, my business and the 26 new jobs we have created to date would not exist. I would encourage the committee to support this amendment. By doing so, your preservation of the PMD will make a positive and meaningful impact on existing and new businesses in the PMD by providing entitlements necessary to locate modern manufacturing businesses within close proximity to the clients and consumers they intend to serve.

Affordable real estate, which outside of the PMD, is highly cost prohibitive for manufacturing businesses in Chicago, sometimes forcing them to move out of the city limits. Clarity on the zoning of this area for the foreseeable future to encourage more development of manufacturing businesses. Manufacturing jobs close to public transportation and major highways, making it accessible for residents from around Chicago to reach their place of employment.

And also an environment for growing manufacturing businesses to thrive, add jobs, and increase taxable sales and revenue. The PMD and the entitlements it provides cultivate an environment of entrepreneurship for new and growing manufacturing businesses right here in the heart of Chicago. Protecting and preserving the PMD is important because the PMD4 provides a necessary source of clarity for modern manufacturing businesses.

It provides a functional, physical distinction between manufacturing businesses and the surrounding community, protecting both users. Preservation of the PMD also provides a stable land use policy for the area, which will encourage new and increased investment by the owners of manufacturing businesses already located in this community. The location of PMD4 is critical for many of these businesses who directly service the Loop, the West Loop, and other surrounding neighborhoods.

The location of PMD4 is also critical to maintain the availability of manufacturing-related jobs in the heart of Chicago. To date, it has created and provided an environment for these businesses to be successful by contributing directly to the growth and prosperity of some of Chicago's greatest name brands, such as Goose Island, Farmer's Fridge, Intelligentsia Coffee, just to name a few. I would encourage all of you to support this amendment, and by doing so, memorialize additional flexibility for businesses whose primary function is manufacturing by allowing these businesses expanded retail and office functions, which serve as direct support functions to their manufacturing businesses.

So that would be a recommended addition, in my opinion. Thank you for your time. I appreciate the opportunity.

[Speaker 1] (1:32:12 - 1:32:18)
Thank you, sir. Thank you for coming down. Kelly, good morning.

[Speaker 57] (1:32:18 - 1:33:43)
Good morning. I'll keep it nice and short and brief. My name is Kelly Deedy.

I work at the Coons Glove Company. We've been on the west side of Chicago for 119 years. We manufacture leather gloves for the power utility companies.

Every ComEd truck has a pair of our gloves on their truck, if not a couple dozen. We've moved four times in those years. The last one was from Oakley in the P&D to the Fulton Market, staying in the P&D.

The reason we moved was for the better space for the interests of the company. We have never moved again and to never move again. But the reason we stayed in the P&D was because of the closeness for our employees to go to and from work.

Around 50% of our employees live on the west side of Chicago. Our employees are from various backgrounds and education levels. One of our employees was a high school dropout and she has worked for us for 23 years and is now in a management position.

The P&D allows my business not only to survive, but to strive. Without the P&D, it would be hard to survive in the area as a small business. And my fear is that moving the company out of the city, we would lose our workforce and our workforce would have a hard time getting a job that they would qualify for.

We're very proud to stamp Made in Chicago on a quarter million gloves that we make every year around the world in our 50-person factory on the west side of Chicago. So I'm for the P&D in order for businesses like my own to stay.

[Speaker 1] (1:33:43 - 1:33:52)
Thank you very much. John Hall. Good morning, John.

[Speaker 40] (1:33:52 - 1:36:10)
Good morning, Alderman. My name is John Hall. I'm the founder of Goose Island Beer Company.

I'm here with the president of Goose Island, Todd Osman. We're here to support the modernization of the Kinsey Industrial Corridor's planned manufacturing district. I opened a brewpub on Clyburn in 1988.

It was located in the first, Chicago's first P&D. So I was familiar with the P&D right at the beginning. In 1995, we decided to open a production brewery where we would make our beer available in bottles and kegs and make it available to people throughout Chicago.

Some of our investors thought we should look in the suburbs because we could probably save some money and it might be easier. But back then, while we weren't Chicago's beer, I was committed to staying in Chicago. We spent nine months looking for properties and we found a property on West Fulton Street.

In 1998, the P&D, the Kinsey Corridor P&D was established. We were very pleased about that. It enabled us to grow.

In fact, in the next 15 years, we more than tripled our footprint, hired many people, and grew. In addition, in 2012, we opened a 300,000-square-foot warehouse, also in the P&D, on Sacramento Street for our world-famous barrel warehousing program and an event space. So we are very, very committed to the P&D.

The neighborhood has changed and so has manufacturing. But it's still true that businesses like Goose Island back in 1998 and Goose Island today needs to know that they can grow and be supported by the city and not be affected in their plans. The P&D is vital to both of these reasons and we command Mayor Lightfoot, Alderman Burnett, and the Department of Planning and Development for their continued commitment to businesses.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:36:11 - 1:36:46)
Thank you, John. And thank you for your commitment to the city and a wildly successful brand. Okay, the following three will be opposed.

And they, well, four. Okay, there's four left to oppose and they will be Kevin Drever, Martha Montanez, Roger Romanelli, and Dan Olas. So the four can get in order and we'll start with Kevin.

[Speaker 59] (1:36:46 - 1:38:04)
Good morning, esteemed committee members. My name is Kevin Drever. I'm a native of Chicago and I live at 426 North Ada Street at the intersection of Hubbard and Ada in the area that John Kuypers had described earlier.

I would say I'm really, honestly, with the for or against, not really against, to be very honest. I support everything that was just said by the founder of Goose Island. I do live in that corridor that is in the area east of Ashland through Ogden.

And the main concern I have, and I just want to express to the committee, is the idea that in that section, if you could somehow make a change, be not to allow for an expansion in the footprint of bars and restaurants, because there still are a lot of residents that we think more, excuse me, in larger restaurants and bars would create more traffic noise and potentially indirectly contribute to an increase in crime.

And my second concern would just be about the placement of a gunnery in that area, which I believe this ordinance will allow. But everything that was said by the founder, I'm very supportive of all the businesses and the prior two speakers that are in favor. But I do have some reservations, a couple items.

[Speaker 1] (1:38:04 - 1:38:07)
Thank you. Thank you, Kevin, for coming down. Martha?

[Speaker 32] (1:38:08 - 1:38:35)
Hi, my name is Martha Montaignez and I've been in the area since I was a little girl. Oh, I'm opposed to having the PMD lifted. I like it the way it is.

I like it just like it is now. We have a nice family neighborhood. My husband and I inherited my grandma's building.

We have a nice family neighborhood. It's quiet with children on it. We don't need another Wicker Park, Fulton Market on our block.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:38:36 - 1:38:40)
Thank you, Martha, for your commitment to our city and your neighborhood. Roger?

[Speaker 15] (1:38:43 - 1:42:50)
Good afternoon. I'm Roger Romanelli and I'm the director of the Fulton Market Association and the Kinsey Corridor Development Committee. We're a nonprofit neighborhood-based group.

We're asking you to please delay approval of the PMD proposal today. The planning department's process has simply not properly involved the public. The draft was released April 9th.

There was no public meeting. The proposal was extensively revised on July 24th with reversals and changes and no explanations. One meeting was held in August with city staff cutting people off while speaking.

By comparison, the city's north branch PMD had 25 public meetings. We do not quarrel with wanting to dismiss the PMD west of Ashland. We want to keep the PMD west of Ashland.

But east of Ashland, the process does not match Mayor Lightfoot's pledge of open government. We cannot rush a plan in 48 days after 21 years of waiting to discuss it. Please table this proposal and let our community meet with the new planning commissioner.

Now, for two decades, our association served industrial food businesses in Fulton Market. We fully supported PMD zoning to prevent encroaching residential units. But when there was no longer a concentration of industry, people agreed to lift the PMD and remaining industry haven't been forced out or priced out.

With the same commitment to industry but seeing Chicago's urgent need for more economic development, here are concerns about the Ashland, Ogden-Ashland area and the proposal. There is great support to repeal the PMD. This is what the majority of the community wants.

While we value Coons Glove and other remaining industrial firms, they are in the minority. Like Fulton Market, we can repeal the PMD, we can protect industrial companies, and we can gain urgently needed new economic development. Now, the proposal doesn't admit in this area that thousands of people don't have a grocery store.

Let us solve this and reduce vehicle reliance. The proposal doesn't show that Noble Street residents sued to stop illegal noise violations outside their bedrooms. If another conflicting use comes to Noble and Kinsey, more legal action could occur.

There is a clear case for PMD repeal. Please allow our community to dialogue with the new planning commissioner. Over in the Ashland-Sacramento area, the PMD absolutely should remain to protect industrial businesses from residential encroachment.

But most people don't support the details of calling to eliminate five existing commercial business types from future licenses that are allowed today. Why can't a PMD employee walk to a dentist, a doctor, or a personal trainer on their lunch break? Why can't people drop off children at daycare centers in the PMD?

Why don't we acknowledge the corridor as our events production corridor with so many industrial businesses that want event spaces to showcase their services? Amid the city's proposal, there is no evidence that these five businesses are jeopardizing the success of any of the industrial companies in any way. There are no examples or testimonials on pages 31 and 38 of the city's proposal.

We have three sentences. We have three sentences about taking away existing low-impact commercial business rights without any examples of any conflicts. If the department, for the first time in PMD history, wants to take away low-impact commercial businesses that are wanted by thousands of PMD employees and thousands of Westside residents, please, dialogue with the community.

Present the evidence. There is one million square feet of available space and land in the PMD. We need to fill up the Westside with businesses.

We have seen in Fulton Market that commercial businesses and industrial businesses can absolutely coexist and thrive. That is the cornerstone of Fulton Market success. Please let us dialogue with the new planning commissioner.

Thank you very much.

[Speaker 61] (1:42:51 - 1:44:02)
Thank you for coming down. Dan Ollis, please. Good morning.

My name is Dan Ollis, and I have been a resident of the 27th Ward for over 20 years. Today, we're here to ask Alderman Burnett and the committee to postpone the vote on this proposal, the Kinsey PMD proposal. As you can hear today, there are a lot of moving pieces going on here.

We love our business owners. We love John and Todd and the Glovelady and Kelly. They're all fantastic.

What we're looking for here, though, is to review what's been proposed and to make recommendations from the residents like myself, the other business owners. We're all here to work to make the PMD much better, bigger, brighter for the next 20 years. So without going into reiterations of what everybody said today, I ask you just once again, let's take our time with this.

We've waited 20 years before this can come under review. Let's learn about it. Let's make suggestions.

Let's make it better for everyone. Thank you.

[Speaker 25] (1:44:04 - 1:44:05)
Great.

[Speaker 1] (1:44:05 - 1:44:22)
All right. The following three and last three speakers are in favor of this application. They include Steve DiBretto.

Steve, come on down. Kate Jacobus and Mohana Dandamidu.

[Speaker 31] (1:44:22 - 1:44:23)
Sorry about that.

[Speaker 1] (1:44:29 - 1:44:34)
Steve? Good morning. Morning.

[Speaker 21] (1:44:34 - 1:48:09)
My name is Steve DiBretto. I'm the executive director of the Industrial Council of Near West Chicago. We're a non-profit economic development organization in the Kinsey Corridor.

And I'm here this morning to speak in favor of the Kinsey PMD proposal. Our planned manufacturing district is doing exactly what it was designed to do. It's protecting modern urban industrial users from residential and retail encroachment.

It stops them from being priced out or from being cast as nuisances for conducting their operations. And it allows them to employ Chicagoans of all backgrounds and levels of educational achievement. The decision in front of you couldn't be more straightforward.

You vote to support inclusive economic development with this modernized PMD, or you vote against the ordinance and reward real estate speculation that crowds out career path jobs like the ones our small businesses provide. If you read the business press, here's some of what you've been hearing the past couple years about the PMD. From a commercial broker quoted in Cranes, March 2017, this is about the area west of Ashland.

I don't think you'll have the same demand as you did east of Ashland, but you'll see a lot of money. It's a better price point, and it's people looking at the long haul to go retail or residential. In other words, they're buying property, banking on the PMD being eliminated.

From a broker of a PMD property in April of 2017, quoted in the Tribune, a long-term owner of the property could wait to see how potential changes to the PMD zoning play out in the next year or two. In the meantime, a landlord could make upgrades to the building and replace expiring leases with new deals at considerably higher rents. Here's a real estate attorney quoted in RE Journal from October of last year.

Even if there are employees of industrial uses who live close to their work, those uses are just not conducive to developing neighborhoods. Finally, a broker of a PMD property quoted in Globe Street, February of this year, the city's proposed rezoning of the Kinsey Industrial Corridor is attracting strong interest from investors and developers as they look to move west of Fulton Market. Of course it is.

That's all we've been hearing for the last several years. Invest now, and when all these factories go away, you'll make a lot of money. I get it.

If you own property in the PMD and you've seen the skyrocketing prices that some of the buildings in Fulton Market have been fetching, you want in. Who wouldn't? But it's not policymakers' job to inflate the resale value of property at the expense of industry in the PMD.

If you own property in the PMD, there's plenty of money that you can make doing business or selling that property. You don't need a zoning change for that. For nearly 40 years, my organization, ICNC, has owned one of the largest and oldest business incubators in the country, MakeCity.

Small, light industrial businesses spend a few years with us, and they usually hire their first 10 or 12 employees before they outgrow us and move on. We own 416,000 square feet right in the middle of the PMD. So I don't understand it when people who oppose the PMD tell me that you can't make money under this zoning.

We do. And we reinvest it all. I believe that was three minutes, not four.

We do. And we reinvest all of that money back into our mission. I don't understand it when they tell me that they can't find an industrial tenant when we've been hitting 96 and 97 percent occupancy for years.

And if the call is for more safety or property tax relief or more business services, we agree. And we'd like to partner with you. This PMD modernization can be part of a strategy to achieve those things.

I commend the Department of Planning and Development for its thorough work. And I respectfully ask the committee to support the proposal. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:48:10 - 1:48:11)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 24] (1:48:11 - 1:51:34)
Next is Kate. Good morning. My name is Kate Jacobus.

I'm the founder of Maliora Cleaning Products, a sustainable manufacturing company based in the PMD. I'm here to speak today to support the proposal for the changes to the PMD. There are important changes that are going to help my business, my fellow business owners in the corridor and the city as a whole.

My company was founded in 2013 and we make people and planet friendly cleaning products. Making products here in the city has presented some unique challenges starting from our very founding. Making products is not something that you can legally do here in Chicago in your basement or in your garage.

So right at the beginning, we needed to look for a space where we were welcomed. We couldn't get a spot in a shared office building. We couldn't rent a spot at 1871.

Our kind of company that's making dust, making noise and making physical products is not welcome at these wonderful locations that make sense for other small and growing businesses. So we moved into the PMD. We've been at the incubator for several years now and the entire time that our business has been functioning, we've grown two times and three times a year in revenue growth.

Our business is exploding. I know you all know Goose Island. You've heard of Goose Island and how they were supported in the PMD.

You might not have heard of Maliora Cleaning Products yet, but you have today and we'll be as big as Goose Island pretty soon and the PMD is supporting us in doing that and growing. Right now, we have seven people making a living wage at our factory in the corridor. It's a great place to do business.

Every morning we get there. By the way, I walk to work. I'm a resident of the local area too.

I love that I walk from a quiet street where I wave at my neighbors. I've got some nine-year-old twins that are happily running around the street in a very safe residential area and five minutes later, I'm in a zoned manufacturing corridor where trucks can come in and out and manufacturing is taking place. We get a lot of business done.

I'm so happy to be in a place where the kind of work that we do is welcomed. We're next to places like coffee roasters, brandy distilleries, several breweries, which is awesome. And we're happy to be good neighbors to those sorts of businesses.

Coffee roasteries, the perfect accompaniment next door to a soap making company. We both have deliveries. We can support each other and multiple small business owners in the corridor all work to help each other out.

This sort of modern green manufacturing takes place every day in the corridor and we will continue to keep growing with the PMD remaining in place and being modernized with this plan. We plan and we really want to stay in the city. We love living close to our jobs and being able to grow our business.

Having so many great products that are made here in Chicago has been really wonderful and we want to continue to support that. I'm here not just on behalf of myself and my company, but I also represent a lot of other small business owners. If anyone here in the building has been a small business owner or if they know or are close to a small business owner, you know that we can't always take a few hours out of our day to go to a zoning committee meeting.

So I hope you understand that like finding a blazer instead of a soap stained apron, you know, it took a lot. And I'm really happy and glad that I could be here today to speak on behalf of my company and other businesses like mine in the corridor. Thank you for this opportunity.

Thanks.

[Speaker 1] (1:51:34 - 1:51:41)
Thank you, Kate. Mohana. I'm not going to try the last name.

[Speaker 44] (1:51:45 - 1:51:45)
Good afternoon, sir.

[Speaker 1] (1:51:45 - 1:51:46)
Thank you.

[Speaker 44] (1:51:47 - 1:51:59)
My name is Mohan Dandamudi. We own the property at 1420 West Hubbard Street. We are in granite fabrication and installation business for most of these major buildings.

[Speaker 1] (1:51:59 - 1:52:03)
Could you speak in a little bit to the mic? I'm having a little difficulty hearing you.

[Speaker 44] (1:52:03 - 1:54:00)
We do fabrication and installation for most of the high-rise buildings in Chicago. We have been in this location, 1420 West Hubbard. That's between Ashland Avenue and Ogden.

And I'm only concentrating on that area because we are affected by having PMD. When we moved from Oak Brook, I'm sorry, Elk Grove Village, about 20 years ago, there was a lot of manufacturing around our warehouse. Now things have changed.

There are very few in manufacturing. We have all kinds of other businesses around us. And our taxes have increased many fold and we don't have any relief from the city being in PMD.

When we moved out, I was one of the first proponents to support our alderman Barnett and also Steve Debrato. They helped me so much. But it has changed in the last five, six years.

So we feel it's even expensive for us to stay there for our granite fabrication business. So when I talk to a lot of people, there's a mixed emotions. I only request you to reconsider postponing this.

And then talk to each one of us who are affected. I'm all for PMD, but this corridor is very much affected by having PMD. We have too many restrictions.

So I'm for PMD. I'm also against PMD. I'm the only one, I guess, experiencing these two developments.

So I have lived in Chicago for the last 57 years. This is my home. This is one of the best countries.

[Speaker 1] (1:54:02 - 1:55:58)
Okay, thank you. So just let me clarify. You are opposed to the application?

Right now. Yes. Obviously a delay is what I've heard.

Right. Okay. Thank you.

I want to make sure that's in the record. Thank you for coming down. That's the end of the testimony on the public testimony period.

But we have received a petition with 50 signatures opposed to this Kinsey Corridor Amendment from residents in the area. I just, for the record, it's submitted. And what is that?

Okay, we'll bring it to our clerk and then we'll add that to the documentation. All right. So at this time, we're going to get on to the mayoral application 1908, ordinance referred on July 24th of 19.

The amendment of the municipal code title 17 regarding the boundaries, use table standards and supplemental use standards for plan manufacturing district number four, also known as the Kinsey Corridor. It is my understanding that there is a substitute for the item. Alderman Ravois moves to accept the substitute.

All those in favor? Aye. And are any opposed?

The ayes have it. And the substitute is before us. We have our zoning administrator, Patrick Murphy, here to speak on the matter.

And then before that, I'll get to Patrick to note that we've got four letters of support from business owners in the area, which all committee members will find in their respective packets. So there's additional ones that we've received. Obviously the input both for and against has been heard.

And we'll forward all this to our committee members, correct?

[Speaker 32] (1:55:58 - 1:56:01)
In addition to those four, we received 15 more letters.

[Speaker 1] (1:56:01 - 1:56:17)
15 more. So obviously it's a heated issue. There's a lot of activity on both sides of the aisle.

But thank you all for coming down and your commitment to our city and our industrial corridor. So Patrick, let's start. Patrick Murphy.

[Speaker 3] (1:56:18 - 1:56:57)
Thank you. Good afternoon, Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Patrick Murphy with the Department of Planning and Development.

I'm here to discuss the proposed changes to Chapter 17-6 of the Chicago Zoning Ordinance as it relates to the Kinsey Plan Manufacturing District. As you noted, thank you for supporting the substitute ordinance. And I'd like to add that after discussions with Alderman Burnett and the community, the substitute specifically reverses the omission of sports and recreational activities and adjusts the eating and drinking size limitations in the B subarea of this PMD.

And it permits daycares as incidental commercial uses in subarea A along the west side of Ashland Avenue.

[Speaker 1] (1:56:59 - 1:57:00)
So this is new information for the people?

[Speaker 3] (1:57:01 - 1:57:03)
That's just to clarify what the substitution entailed.

[Speaker 1] (1:57:03 - 1:57:09)
Okay, I just want everyone to understand because there was obviously some concern about the variety of uses.

[Speaker 3] (1:57:09 - 2:02:28)
Right, it adjusts the daycare and the size of the two uses that we talked about in the subarea B. The changes detailed in this proposed substitute ordinance amendment are designed, one, to maintain the existing floor area ratio and boundaries of the Kinsey PMD, otherwise known as PMD 4, and depicted on the map in your packets. Shift the interior subarea boundaries, the before and after conditions are also available in the packets, excuse me, on page seven.

Sorry, there you go. Adjust the allowed, permitted, and prohibited uses to better reflect the evolution of this PMD and the present land use conditions, as well as reinforce the city's commitment to the role of our PMDs and to bring PMD 4's use standards into conformance with those of PMDs 1, 2, 3, and 5, which the city has recently previously evaluated. Specifically regarding the uses, all legally established current uses, regardless of the terms of this substitute amendment, would be permitted to remain as legal non-conformities.

Those non-conformities, which will remain, are indicated in blue and... Sorry, Nicole, use the mic the other way. The ordinance before you today represents the culmination of over five years of analysis by the city.

What began in 2014 with the Fulton Market Innovation District Plan evolved with the expansion of the downtown zoning classification and bonus floor area structure in 2016 and the repeal of a portion of this same PMD east of Ogden Avenue in 2017 to a commitment by the city that same fall to analyze the PMD west of Ogden and present to the city council our findings and recommendations. We're here today following up on that commitment pursuant to the requirements of the zoning ordinance to regularly review the city's PMDs to make these recommendations. In the western sub area, west of Ashland, and to be renamed PMD 4A, the permitted uses would promote the continued industrial importance and viability of the Kinsey Industrial Corridor and reduce conflicts between industrial and manufacturing businesses, incompatible commercial uses and intensive industrial uses.

Some commercial uses would no longer be permitted, large-scale restaurants, taverns, private event spaces, and some heavy industrial uses would no longer be permitted, including container storage, intense manufacturing, and waste-related. In the eastern sub area, the portion between Ashland and Ogden, now referred to as PMD 4B, some new commercial uses would be permitted to more accurately reflect current uses and act as a buffer between the downtown district east of Ogden and the reinforced industrial and manufacturing sub area 4A west of Ashland. Permitted uses will include office over 9,000 square feet, restaurants and taverns up to 4,000 square feet, personal services and food and beverage sales up to 8,000 square feet, and the zoning board could expand restaurant and tavern uses up to 12,000 square feet.

Furthermore, the east and west frontages of Ashland would be treated similarly as the ZBA could allow zoning lots that front on the west side of Ashland in the proposed PMD 4A to permit office floor area over 9,000 square feet and incidental commercial uses on the ground floor of the building. This would ensure both frontages of this major transit-oriented corridor would be developed similarly. This planning process for the area of the PMD west of Ogden included two public meetings held last summer and fall, followed by a release of the draft plan earlier this spring, which was adopted by the plan commission in May.

Specific to these zoning details, the ordinance before you was introduced in July and a public hearing was held in mid-August. Separately, staff from DPD, including myself, Steve Valenziano, Commissioner Gorski, and Erica Selke from our planning bureau have met and otherwise communicated with numerous various land and business owners about the planning process and ordinance. The department is confident in our research and recommendations and the accompanying public process, and we thank you for considering this amendment.

Myself, along with others from DPD are here for any questions you may have about this ordinance. Thank you again. No, because that was for the framework.

Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:02:29 - 2:02:38)
Do we have Alderman Burnett? Okay. Questions, many members.

Alderman Beal.

[Speaker 10] (2:02:39 - 2:02:48)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This amendment, was it presented to the overall community on this amendment? The text amendment was, yes, sir.

[Speaker 3] (2:02:49 - 2:03:04)
Well, so it's two different things. So the framework plan, we referenced that was approved by plan commission, was addressed through the community process earlier this year and this summer. And then that was approved separately by the plan commission.

Then the text changes of which this is specific to was the community meeting that was referenced in August.

[Speaker 10] (2:03:04 - 2:03:17)
And these were introduced back in July. Okay. So was that committee meeting here or was it held in the community?

It was held out in the community. Okay. So everything that we're voting on today, this amendment was communicated throughout the community.

[Speaker 3] (2:03:17 - 2:03:29)
Yes. And the changes that I referenced at the beginning were a specific by-product of questions and comments and concerns that came out of that as we followed up with Alderman Burnett after the community meeting. Okay.

Incorporating the substitute. Yes.

[Speaker 10] (2:03:29 - 2:04:03)
Well, again, I mean, it just goes back to my point that an amendment is coming before us. Okay. And, you know, the people testified and then we adopt an amendment.

The amendment should have been adopted first and communicated first and then the community has an opportunity to talk about what we're voting on now. Okay. Because what we're voting on right now, even though it was in the community, testimony does not reflect what is before us right now.

[Speaker 3] (2:04:04 - 2:04:05)
It doesn't reflect the changes.

[Speaker 10] (2:04:05 - 2:04:28)
Okay. So that just goes back to my point, Mr. Chairman. And I'm, you know, with all due respect to you, Mr. Chairman, you know, the process needs to be fixed because we need to hear from the community. When an amendment comes before us, they need to talk about what is before us and not something that has been changed. All right. So.

[Speaker 42] (2:04:29 - 2:04:29)
Understood.

[Speaker 10] (2:04:29 - 2:04:35)
All right. So I'm going to continue to beat that dead horse until we make that change, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:04:40 - 2:04:42)
Questions. Other questions from committee members.

[Speaker 63] (2:04:46 - 2:04:49)
Want to see if Alderman Burnett wants to come in here?

[Speaker 24] (2:05:10 - 2:05:10)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (2:05:11 - 2:05:13)
Alderman Siccio-Lopez.

[Speaker 17] (2:05:15 - 2:06:27)
In regards of, and we have an endorsed corridor in the 20 feet ward. I shared some of the concerns that the residents have expressed. We obviously want to maintain that balance between the corridors and residential areas.

My question goes in terms of the process for evaluation of projects or permits that come in. We've seen, you know, in all endorsed corridor, obviously when you have, with the current zoning, it is hard to bet projects when they come in. We definitely, I think there's a lot of room for improvement to make sure that we can discuss about environmental impact studies.

And obviously I share the concerns to make sure that the residents can have a voice and they can actually evaluate, you know, the projects coming in. So maybe if you can tell us maybe what are those things that maybe can be done in terms of, I know that the zoning process works differently in endorsed area. So maybe what are those things that you can suggest so that they can be implemented under this ordinance?

[Speaker 3] (2:06:29 - 2:07:15)
So Patrick, so as of, so currently, if a project comes in an industrial corridor absent being in a planned manufacturing district and it's looking to rezone to something that would allow a non-industrial use, those have to be heard before the plan commission. They're not, they are not planned developments necessarily, but they do come with the additional scrutiny that could involve environmental impact studies. It could involve other analysis that would go above and beyond what's something that might be coming in as an as of right project.

If a project in an industrial corridor comes in and hits a planned development threshold or a trigger, then that would carry along the same additional analysis that would come from other similarly scaled projects, whether they were in an industrial area or not, but the analysis would be specific to the industrial corridor and the industrial environment that it's in.

[Speaker 17] (2:07:16 - 2:07:50)
There is concerns in terms of the environmental impact, right? Sometimes, you know, we've seen that in non-industrial corridor, these permits, you know, sometimes don't have to be vetted by the residents. So is there a way to make sure that there are environmental impacts in place and that the residents and the community it is if there are potential concerns about a particular permit?

We've seen that in the 25th ward and it is really hard to, you know, once the permits are awarded, it's really hard to revise those.

[Speaker 3] (2:07:51 - 2:08:25)
The use is permitted by right, then the environmental review wouldn't necessarily take place with zoning, but it could be through the permitting process through the Department of Public Health. If they need additional permits for a waste-related or recycling use that they are doing that has an environmental impact, that may be a part of a separate process that doesn't necessarily come through zoning, but it's through the Department of Public Health with the city that they're asking. It depends on what the requirements are for the permit is that they're seeking.

[Speaker 1] (2:08:28 - 2:08:46)
Thank you, Alderman. Alderman Raboyas. Oh, I think that conversation is obviously something that Alderman Lopez and the department can work on, especially concerning his issues that was presented.

[Speaker 2] (2:08:48 - 2:16:15)
Okay, now we'll hear from Alderman Burnett. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. First of all, I want to commend the Department of Planning for all of their due diligence and all of the meetings that they've had and all of the work that they had.

Of course, I've had many meetings in regards to this. Some of you may or may not know that I have ward night every Monday night and Thursday night. On average, on Thursday night, I've been getting an average of 10 people a night coming to me about this particular issue and I have to explain to them what's going on because there's a lot of miscommunication and misinformation in regards to this.

As the industrial council has said, there are some developers who want to make a lot of money and turn this area around at the expense of people's jobs and businesses and they have their ideas to make money but we have our ideas to help people keep their jobs. Some of you may or may not know I introduced the PMD over 20 years ago. I put the PMD in to protect businesses.

There's over 20 something thousand businesses. I mean, 20 something thousand jobs in this area. People are getting living wages.

Folks are making money. They live every day. They work hard and we want to help them to be able to keep their jobs.

Businesses in this community have asked to be able to stay there without being challenged by residents. Some of you all that are all of you aldermen that are like me, you know when your residents complain about a business, we have to respond and it puts us in awkward positions, right? So this area is an area that allow these businesses to be able to stay there without being challenged, right?

And also being able to make an investment and expand their business like Goose Island did when John came to me in 1998, right? He started a small business now Goose Island is being sold all over the world, right? And we're very proud of it.

And one of the reasons why he moved to the PMD because he knew that he was not going to be encroached upon and potentially get harassed and closed down because of residents living around them. So we have to have a balance in our community. The other thing I know some of the residents I hear from South and West of the PMD, having the PMD in place encourage more development to happen West in their area.

If we open a PMD up for residential, every residential developer will only build in the PMD area and they will not build South. I mean, build West because they feel like they can get that property for cheaper and they feel like why build on the West side when we can get these properties and not have to deal with a lot of residents to hassle us in these developments. We've been very, I want to thank the Department of Planning for listening.

The residents came to me because they were concerned about big restaurants being East of Ashland. Right now, some of them may or may not know that right now you could open up a 4,000 square foot restaurant and then you can go up to 8,000 square feet. Well, in this new plan, it allows you to go up to 12,000 square feet, but I told planning to allow for 4,000 square feet to be there, but if you want to go up higher, you have to come before the community in order to get their approval.

So if there's something that the community don't want, we won't allow it to happen. Folks asked about daycares. So we encourage more daycares to happen.

Folks asked about dog cares, which we have a lot of dog places in this PMD. We took that off the map and allowed that to continue to happen because there are a lot of kennels and dog grooming and dog boarding and all of those dog things in the area, which I have two dogs and my dogs go to some of them, you know, so we allowed those things to continue to happen. I do want to say the PMD allowed for East of Ashland and a little bit West of Ashland to be able to have more offices because industrial and commercial is all changing.

You're having these tech offices and a lot of kids working there and we allow for more square footage to be put in these offices in order for these businesses to be able to expand. We heard that from some of the people at some of the meetings. Just about everything we heard at the meetings that would not hinder other businesses, we incorporated and we encourage them to incorporate it.

So, you know, the other, the alternative to this plan is having the PMD stay there as it is. That's the only alternative. There's no other alternative.

Residential is not going to go there. The only other alternative is to leave it like it is. And so this will allow for some property owners to be able to expand, have more retail, have a lot of other things East of Ashland in those areas connected, adjacent to what's going on in Fulton Market, but without the residential.

So we are planning, and this is a planning plan. This came from the administration, but I support it. Planning is easing up to allow with the changes that's happening in the area, but at the same time, protecting those folks West of Ashland that want to stay there.

We have everything over there from transfer stations where people, you know, they transfer garbage all over the place and it smells to all types of manufacturing that's been there for a long time. And as you all seen in the second ward, it's hard for businesses like that to move. And they have a protected area and they moved to this area because it was a protected area and we're going to keep it a protected area for them to be able to stay here.

So I ask all of you all, if you will support this. I know some people not going to like it. Let me tell you guys, in this business you learn, you can't satisfy everybody, right?

But at the end of the day, you have to do what's right for the majority of the people. And it's right for folks to be able to keep their jobs, people to be able to keep their business. And guess what?

The developers will be able to develop somewhere else, hopefully going West. And they're going to continue to make their money. But we, I am not driven by developers being able to make money at the expense of people losing their jobs.

We have to help folks to keep their jobs and help businesses to stay in the city of Chicago. It has to be a win-win situation. And this is a win-win situation in this community.

And I ask for all of you all support. Thank you very much. And of course, people, some folks aren't going to like it.

But hey, I still sleep at night. So thank you all very much. Thank you, Alderman.

Alderman LaSpada.

[Speaker 12] (2:16:17 - 2:18:23)
Thank you very much, Chairman. This feels like the first major zoning decision I've had the opportunity to weigh in on. I'm not a voting member of this body.

I have a relatively slim section of PMD 4B, but a lot of the surrounding area. And I was committed to a deliberative decision. And I'm really grateful for many of the people in the gallery here who reached out to me.

Folks from CPD, from Fulton Market Association, from ICNC, many businesses and individuals who came to inform my perspective on this. It's the kind of decision making I want to be able to embrace as an alderman. Ultimately, I was convinced of the merits of the plan that we're looking at today.

Looking at the statistics, the stories of business owners in this community, the fact that manufacturing is evolving, but it is evolving and on the way up in this area, not only in terms of productivity, but in terms of the jobs that are being created. So many reached out to me saying, we want to expand our workforce and our footprint, but we want the clarity and the stability and the predictability that allows us to do this. I see this as a plan that helps those businesses succeed, but also opens up new commercial opportunities, particularly in PMDB.

It's really exciting and a thoughtful process that I think we've worked through. I know that there were concerns around deliberation, around the public process. I hope for at least constituents of the First Ward that you believed that I heard your perspective and made space in my office and came to meet you where you are at to hear your perspectives.

But I really believe in what we are doing here and in the future of jobs and manufacturing within this space. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:18:24 - 2:18:28)
Thank you, Alderman. Alderman Osterman.

[Speaker 37] (2:18:29 - 2:18:57)
I commend the Planning Department and Alderman Burnett. We need a place for these jobs. And I think as someone who's seen that whole area grow and can envision the next five to 10 years, the housing is going to continue to grow around there, but we need to make sure that these businesses provide important living wage jobs for Chicagoans, have a place to stay and grow as well.

So I'll be supporting this.

[Speaker 1] (2:18:58 - 2:19:02)
All right. Alderman Waguesbay.

[Speaker 22] (2:19:02 - 2:19:32)
Thank you, Chairman. It sounds like it's moving in the right direction. It was good to see the amount of meetings that were held.

And perhaps all those businesses that are leaving the Lincoln Yards PMD can move right into this PMD. As the other chairman said, move west. Perhaps that's a good place for it, but it looks like it was well vetted otherwise and I do support it.

Great, great.

[Speaker 1] (2:19:32 - 2:19:56)
Okay, without any more questions, I just for process-wise for the audience, Patrick, will you just summarize quickly the substitute? And the timing-wise, I think Alderman Beal has a point. I just, before we vote, I just wanna make sure the audience, everyone knows what is in the substitute.

I think the alderman referred to grooming, dog grooming, some other things.

[Speaker 3] (2:19:56 - 2:21:42)
So the dog kenneling remained. What changed is in subarea B, so the more commercial permissive eastern edge of the PMD is being treated in a subarea B like we have traditionally treated other PMDs. We allow for greater commercial flexibility, still a prohibition of residential, but in subarea B, it will allow, as the alderman said, restaurants can start out at 4,000 square feet and go to the zoning board for a 12,000 square foot maximum ability.

That's slightly different than we have in other PMDs, but part of our goal in all of our PMD reviews, the first five that we've done, have been trying to get consistency and predictability in all of the use standards and the fluctuations that are permitted. So that's one that has changed since the community meeting. The other one that was referenced was the daycare allowance.

So like I talked about on Ashland Avenue, we're allowing greater commercial flexibility on the west side of Ashland, which is in the stricter PMD 4A, but it allows it to mirror the commercial flexibility on the west side of Ashland. And as a part of that, on the subarea A, we will allow for daycare uses as permitted commercial incidental uses in those commercial buildings along the west side of Ashland. And the third one...

Sorry, oh, it was restaurants and taverns. Sorry, I had referenced both. Oh, and also sports and recreation.

So you have indoor sports and rec facilities, areas that are treated in the subarea B for commercial purposes to allow for indoor activities that people can come to for event purposes, not large special events we're talking about, facilities that you would go to for entertainment purposes. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:21:43 - 2:22:05)
So may I have a motion do pass on this ordinance? Alderman Brendan Riley. Motions do pass.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

In the opinion to share, the ayes have it, and the ordinance is passed as amended. Okay.

[Speaker 63] (2:22:06 - 2:22:06)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:22:06 - 2:22:13)
Thank you. All right. Now we're moving to large sign.

Yeah.

[Speaker 2] (2:22:14 - 2:22:17)
Say it again. Good job, Patrick. Thank you.

Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:22:18 - 2:30:09)
We're staying on the addendum, moving to large signs over 100 square feet in area, 24 feet above grade. We will hear them all together. I will read the ward followed by the address and take a motion at the end.

Last on the addendum, we have one historical landmark designation that being document number 02019-5484. In the 40th ward, the historical landmark designation for the former Lyman Trumbull public school building at 5200 North Ashland Avenue. We have Dan Kleiber here from Department of Planning and Development.

Answer any questions if there, I know it's a very visible building on the corner of Ashland and Foster, I believe, yes. Any questions for the department? For committee members, and if not, can I have a motion to pass on the ordinance?

Alderman Osterman moves do pass on the ordinance. All those in favor say aye. Any opposed?

In the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it. And the ordinance is passed and will be reported out at September 18th. Okay, next we're going on to the regular agenda.

Okay, so document number on page two, document number 20096 T1 in the 48th ward ordinance referred on July 24th. This item 5356 North Sheridan is deferred at the request of Alderman Osterman. Wait, wait, do we want to get a vote on that?

Okay, motion to defer Alderman Osterman. So be it deferred. Next, we're going to go on this one.

Staying in the well, 47th and 48th wards document number 20114 ordinance referred on July 24th of 19. Document number 02019-5584 common address. 5046 through 5056 North Broadway, 1200 West Winnemac Avenue, 5077 North Broadway Avenue, 5051 through 5063 North Broadway and 1125 West Winona.

All right, the change request. Residential business plan development number 1347 to residential business plan development number 1347 as amended. And then we're going to, so this Alderman Lopez was going to move to incorporate the records from the plan commission.

All those in favor? Aye, any opposed? The ayes have it and the records from plan commission are incorporated.

Katie, do you want to make the presentation? So if we have a slide, we're going to see it all. If this is coming, is this the insurance building?

Yeah. Okay, famous building. Okay, let's go.

[Speaker 8] (2:30:10 - 2:31:27)
Thank you. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Katie Janky Dale from the law firm of DLA Piper located at 444 West Lake, which represents 5050 North Broadway property LLC, the applicant for a PD amendment for a property generally located at 5050 North Broadway.

With me today is Jack Tabor from the property owner. The applicant seeks to rezone the property from PD 1347 to PD 1347 as amended to allow for school and daycare as permitted uses. As you can see, the PD consists of portions of the property located on the east and west sides of Broadway, generally between Winnemac and Winona.

It was previously approved in 2018 as a two sub area PD containing 710 overall units. The applicant proposes a technical amendment to the existing PD to allow for school and daycare as permitted uses to accommodate a ground floor retail tenant in the building located at 5060 North Broadway. No other changes are contemplated in connection with this request.

The PD is located in the 47th and 48th wards, and we have worked with both Alderman Martin and Osterman on this request, both of whom have provided letters of support. Our team is available to answer any questions you may have and respectfully request that you recommend City Council approval of the application. Thank you for your time and consideration.

[Speaker 65] (2:31:28 - 2:31:29)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:31:30 - 2:31:35)
Do we want to hear from the Alderman? I know we have letters of support. Alderman Osterman.

[Speaker 37] (2:31:36 - 2:32:02)
Briefly, this had previously had a PD plan on this. There's a building that's been renovated it'll be open this fall. This allows for daycare and school use on ground floor commercial.

It's an exciting building. The developer working with Alderman Poir, Time and myself increase the affordable on site from 10% to 15%. So I would ask the members of committee support this change.

[Speaker 1] (2:32:04 - 2:32:07)
And I do not see Alderman Martin here.

[Speaker 63] (2:32:08 - 2:32:09)
Many member, but we do.

[Speaker 1] (2:32:09 - 2:33:23)
We do have a letter of support. So I would ask for a motion to pass as revised. The ordinance for this building.

Pass as revised. Motion by Alderman Wogsback to pass as revised. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? Opinion of the chair.

The ayes have it. Okay, great. Next.

Good luck. Thank you. Congrats Alderman.

Out of order to page. Okay. All right.

Bottom of page 15 and the 25th ward. This is document number 20083. Again, 25th ward ordinance referred on July 24th of 19.

Common address 969 West 18th street in Alderman Ciccio Lopez's ward. Change request C12 neighborhood commercial district to C13 commercial district. So.

Attorney. Counsel. Good afternoon.

[Speaker 9] (2:33:24 - 2:34:13)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Tyler Manick of the Shane Bakes law firm. I'm here on behalf of Sean Serkin, the applicant who owns the subject property at 969 West 18th street.

The applicant seeks to rezone 969 West 18th street from a C12 neighborhood commercial district to a C13 neighborhood commercial district in order to construct a four-story building. The ground floor will expand the existing dental practice of the applicant's wife and then include three more dwelling units above the ground floor with three parking spaces to be provided. The applicant has met with the alderman who has given his letter of support for this project and I believe he's also here to confirm the support.

We would be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (2:34:14 - 2:34:17)
All right. Alderman Ciccio Lopez, do you want to comment on this?

[Speaker 17] (2:34:18 - 2:34:33)
No, I think just want to thank for the patience of things being, it takes a little while to get our guidelines in order but based on the parking compliance and everything else, everything is in order. So I'm glad to support this project.

[Speaker 1] (2:34:33 - 2:35:16)
Thank you, Alderman. Any questions by committee members? If not, do I have a motion to pass?

So moved by Alderman Raboyas. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Opinion chair, the ayes have it and this item is passed. We will move to the top of page 16.

Thank you. Thank you, council. Again, in the 25th ward application number 20099.

25th ward ordinance referred on July 24th of 19. Common address 901 through 05 West 18th street. Change request the 22 neighborhood mixed-use district to C12 commercial neighborhood commercial district.

[Speaker 43] (2:35:16 - 2:36:00)
Council. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant.

Mr. John Madonnas is here with me. He is the principal with the applicant. This involves an existing four story building that has four units in the building, ground floor, retail space and five parking spaces in the rear.

There's an existing personal service establishment, a massage establishment in the 25th ward that has to leave its current location, wishes to relocate here. That use is not permitted in the B22, hence the proposed rezoning to a C12 so that we can authorize that use. We've met with Alderman Ciccio who's consulted his community, and I believe he's here to speak in support.

Happy to answer any questions the committee may have.

[Speaker 1] (2:36:01 - 2:36:03)
Alderman Ciccio-Lopez.

[Speaker 17] (2:36:04 - 2:36:35)
Thank you, Chairman. Again, and I want to commend the homeowner. He's made a decision to help out a long term business in the community.

Verde now will be able to open the doors. He's been waiting for a space in the community. I know that the landlord also has had an empty storefront for several years, so we're glad to see our business community now having a space and really glad that we'll be able to work together to make this happen.

Happy to support this project.

[Speaker 1] (2:36:36 - 2:37:34)
Thank you, Alderman. Any questions by committee members? If not, Alderman Roboyas moves to pass.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

The chair of the ayes have it, and this item is passed. Thank you very much. All right.

Now we're moving to page three on the regular agenda. Page three, folks. Document number 20104-T1 in the 46th Ward.

Ordinance referred on July 24th of 19. Common address 3501 North Pine Grove Avenue. Change request from an RM-5 residential multi-unit district to an RM-5.5 residential multi-unit district. Good afternoon, Bridget. Counsel, would you proceed?

[Speaker 19] (2:37:35 - 2:39:04)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman. I'm Alderman. My name is Bridget O'Keefe.

I'm an attorney at D'Aspen & Almond, 300 South Wacker, Suite 2200, Chicago, Illinois, 60606. I represent Maynard 3501 Pine Grove LLC, which is the owner and the applicant of the subject property at 3501 North Pine Grove. I'm accompanied by Tammy Bailey, who is the district manager for Chicago for CLK Properties, which is the owner of this subject property.

The property is located at the northeast corner of Pine Grove and Cornelia in the 46th Ward. It's currently zoned RM-5. We're seeking to rezone the property per a type one amendment to an RM-5.5 district. There are currently 16 units of rental housing in a traditional brick courtyard building. They have eight of the 16 units are three to four bedrooms. They are experiencing high vacancies and they would like to have the ability to break a few of these larger units into smaller units to create a total of 21 units.

This would help ensure the financial viability of the building and also allow them to seek parking relief. There'd be no changes to the footprint or the height of the building. We have attended a community meeting sponsored by Alderman Kappelman.

He has issued a letter of support for this project and we would appreciate your support. We are available if you have any further questions.

[Speaker 1] (2:39:07 - 2:39:17)
Okay, we do not have a letter from Alderman Kappelman, but we have Tressa here. I have one too, if you'd like. We have it?

Okay, Tressa, come on.

[Speaker 46] (2:39:34 - 2:40:18)
Hello, my name is Tressa Feer. I am the Chief of Staff for Alderman James Kappelman in the 46th Ward. Thank you, Chairman, for letting me speak.

We had a community meeting with the neighboring residents in this area and they had some concerns about the current building with regard to some garbage issues in the alley and things like that. And the developer agreed or the owner, I'm sorry, agreed to change the area in the back to accommodate better garbage removal and locations. And then I heard from the community saying that they were fine with this change.

[Speaker 1] (2:40:19 - 2:40:58)
Okay, so I want to just ask you and the applicant to opine a little bit on why there's vacancy at Cornelia over here. And if I recall from the testimony, there are larger units. There's three-bedroom units and the request is actually add more density and to cut up some of these three bedrooms.

Would you talk about that for a second? Because I think it's kind of important for us to see some of these in some of these demographic changes that are happening. There's a plus and a minus to this, but let's...

[Speaker 19] (2:40:59 - 2:41:16)
Two points. One is that right now that market in actually your area because you're right next to it. The larger units are not as attractive to renters and the smaller units are.

You have a different demographic moving in. So for this building, for example...

[Speaker 1] (2:41:16 - 2:41:18)
It's always been rental, hasn't it?

[Speaker 19] (2:41:18 - 2:41:57)
Yes. And what's going on here at this building is we have a high vacancy rate of like 12.5%. It's taking an average of 99 days to fill a unit, which is far longer than in CLK's other portfolios. And they feel it's as a result of these larger units.

But what's an interesting point is we looked at the actual issue of density. Yes, there will be an increase in number of units, but there's actually going to be a decrease in the number of beds. Currently, there are 44 bedrooms on the subject property.

And given the plan to break up the larger units into smaller units, there would only be 41 bedrooms at the end of this. So it actually, we think, will result in a little less density.

[Speaker 1] (2:42:00 - 2:42:04)
And in the increase in units, what about affordability?

[Speaker 19] (2:42:05 - 2:42:24)
Because as you can see on the plan to the left, all we're basically doing is just putting a wall in and adding a kitchen. So the average expense of renovating units is about $10,000. So it's exempt from ARO.

And we've got a letter from the Department of Housing confirming that. OK.

[Speaker 1] (2:42:25 - 2:42:29)
Department? Housing, you're saying?

[Speaker 3] (2:42:29 - 2:42:31)
Yeah, it wouldn't be us. OK.

[Speaker 1] (2:42:31 - 2:42:38)
Just wanted to put it on the record. OK. Questions from committee members?

Alderman Henn.

[Speaker 35] (2:42:42 - 2:44:30)
Thank you, Chair. Hello. How's it going?

We're at a loss for these large family-sized units in most places, especially on the north side. And I know you guys have a heavily dense ward. It's surprising to me that you would basically deconvert.

So I'm wondering, I hear you say these things aren't renting. What are the prices? What are the other market conditions?

And knowing that new construction is so expensive, so much of our new construction, honestly, most of the plans coming across my desk now, they're studios, they're one bedrooms. And I hear a lot of developers talk about how it's what the market is dictating. I understand a lot of the different parts of these market forces and what's costing more.

But it's very concerning to me as we're working to keep a lot of buildings from deconverting into single-family homes, just in the neighborhoods next to you. And as we're seeing people being forced out of the city with these increased prices, that we would look to take a really lovely original-ish four-bedroom layout that could accommodate a family that could live someplace and stabilize neighborhoods to turn it into a pretty small unit that, while it might make it more affordable and more attractive for you guys to market, reduces the types of housing stocks that working families can afford. So looking at the area, as you're looking at your single-family homes, how many three- and four-bedroom apartments exist in this market?

And what will it do in starting this trend of reducing the availability of this moving forward?

[Speaker 1] (2:44:32 - 2:44:37)
I think for the applicant, and Trussee, if you want to open it afterwards.

[Speaker 19] (2:44:37 - 2:44:38)
I can absolutely find an answer.

[Speaker 1] (2:44:39 - 2:44:39)
Bridget?

[Speaker 19] (2:44:40 - 2:45:30)
I want to speak on behalf of the Alderman's Office. I know when we went through the community process, there was a recognition that there was more of a demand for these type of units in this particular area, and that there just wasn't as many renters seeking these larger units at these locations. These are older units, and I think the community's concern was that they were not they wanted to make sure that courtyard building stayed in place, which is why they insisted on a type one zoning, because they feel it's really important to the character of the area.

And for the building to be financially viable, they were having to look at this in a different way. And so it was a balancing between we don't use all the FAR now, even with the existing building. And so it was felt that this was really important for the character of the area to make sure this building stays, and that this was one way to do it.

And maybe Trussee would like to jump in.

[Speaker 46] (2:45:31 - 2:46:18)
Yeah, I would just like to say that our area has always been very dense with very small units. That's just how it's always been. And if you look at places like the Lawrence House and other places, they actually increase the size of those units, which were even smaller before.

So it's something in our area we're finding a lot of millennials and folks that don't have cars really can afford these smaller units. And that's why they moved to our neighborhood because we have them. There are other neighborhoods that have larger units, but the ones that people have built recently in our ward, they're not renting.

So that's a good question, I think, for the city overall.

[Speaker 1] (2:46:19 - 2:47:29)
All right. Other questions? Committee members?

Hearing none, I have a motion. On this application, move do pass. Alderman Osterman moves.

All those in favor? Any opposed? The chair of the ayes have it.

And the item will be passed. Right. So, Bridget, we're moving to electronic stuff.

So would you make sure you can help us on that? Thank you so much. OK.

OK. We're going to stay. Trustee, you can sit down here for a sec because I think we're going to moving to the bottom of page three.

On item number 200881 in the 46th ward ordinance referred on July 24th of 19. Common address 4738 through 4750 North Winthrop Avenue. Change request.

RT4 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district to a B25 neighborhood mixed use district. OK.

[Speaker 52] (2:47:34 - 2:48:16)
OK. Good to go? Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My name is Andrew Scott with the law offices of Dykema Gossett. I'm also here today with TJ Sobchak and for the benefit of the person transcribing, SOB CZAK and Mark Heffron. They're both here on behalf of the applicant.

And finally, we have Greg Gibson with Level Architecture, the project architect. Before proceeding on a description of the general project, I just wanted to make sure that the substitute narrative and plans which had been submitted to the Zoning Bureau approximately 10 days ago were before the committee and were made part of this ordinance that's being considered.

[Speaker 1] (2:48:17 - 2:48:33)
So Alderman Marboyas moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for this type one application. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Chair, the ayes have it. The narrative, substitute narrative and plans are accepted.

[Speaker 52] (2:48:33 - 2:49:26)
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. The site that is the subject of the rezoning, as you mentioned, proposed to go from RT4 to B25 type one. It's currently a vacant surface parking lot.

It's within 600 feet of the Lawrence Red Line Station. So it's a transit serve location. The applicant proposes this rezoning in order to develop a four story, 84 unit residential building with 37 parking spaces on the ground floor.

The applicant has met with the local block club, the community and its neighbors, discussed any issues that all of those groups may have. And I believe we have the support of the community groups. And finally, I believe there should be a letter of support on file with your office.

And if not, obviously, Tressa is here to speak to the alderman's support and we're available to answer any questions. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:49:27 - 2:49:49)
Great. So there's been a surface parking lot for, was it servicing the theater district over there or what? Okay.

I know you got the RIV and you got everybody else around there. Right. I know it's right by the train station too.

So Tressa, do you want to speak? We have a letter from Alderman Kappelman. Is there anything procedurally, community input?

[Speaker 46] (2:49:50 - 2:50:19)
Yeah, so Tressa Feer, Alderman Kappelman's office. We had a community meeting with the local block club, Truman Square neighbors. We also had a number of folks that met there with the building next door.

There were a few concerns expressed there. And I know that they met with the developer after that meeting and worked some things out. But the neighborhood voted online and with paper ballots and agreed to support this zoning change.

[Speaker 1] (2:50:21 - 2:50:24)
Great. Questions by committee members, Alderman Osterman.

[Speaker 37] (2:50:26 - 2:50:30)
Is there an on-site affordable component with the ARO?

[Speaker 15] (2:50:32 - 2:50:33)
I'm representing ownership.

[Speaker 1] (2:50:35 - 2:50:38)
Speak into the mic and identify yourself for the record a little slower.

[Speaker 31] (2:50:38 - 2:50:46)
Sure. Mark Heffern representing the ownership. And yes, 10% of the building will be set aside on-site for the ARO.

[Speaker 37] (2:50:48 - 2:51:09)
As someone who's seen this corner over decades, it's been a vacant parking lot. This development, I think, is going to provide quality units right on the corner in an entertainment district with a brand new CTA station that's a couple of years away that's going to really help that block and be a good project for the community.

[Speaker 1] (2:51:10 - 2:51:32)
Great. Great. Okay.

Any other questions for the applicant? Hearing none, can I get a motion to pass with substantive narrative and plans? Alderman Riley moves.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

Opinion of the chair, the ayes have it. And this item is passed.

[Speaker 11] (2:51:33 - 2:51:33)
Thank you.

[Speaker 38] (2:51:34 - 2:51:35)
Yeah.

[Speaker 1] (2:51:35 - 2:51:49)
So now we're going to be at the top of page four. And this item is in the 44th Ward. So I will ask my vice chair, Alderman Rabois, to handle this application.

[Speaker 47] (2:52:15 - 2:52:43)
Our next item is item number 20086 in the 44th Ward. Ordinance referred on 7-24-19. The common address is 3608 to 3610 North Southport.

The change request is a plan development 1047 to a B3-2 community shopping district. For the record name.

[Speaker 51] (2:52:44 - 2:53:58)
Sure. My name is Talar Berberian with the offices of Thompson, Coburn, LLC. And I'm here with.

Sorry, is this mic on? I'm Clark from Bixby Bridge Capital. This application is simply to correct a mistake in the zoning map there.

You can see in the exhibit that we've submitted PD 1047 that is outlined in the red hashed line. And the small yellow highlighted rectangle is the property in question that is being removed from that PD as part of this application. None of the floor area or any of the bulk that is attributed to that small yellow rectangle was used as part of PD 1047.

This is simply to correct the map. It was a Scrivener's error that in error included that portion of the property in the plan development. So that's pretty much the whole case.

The Alderman's office has been involved in this. And is very supportive. And we're here to answer any questions if there are any.

[Speaker 47] (2:53:58 - 2:54:11)
Any questions or comments by committee members? If not, Alderman Cardona moves to pass. All in favor?

All opposed? If any chairs, the ayes have it.

[Speaker 17] (2:54:15 - 2:54:16)
Thank you.

[Speaker 47] (2:54:17 - 2:54:21)
Uh-oh, I got another one. Oh, no, you're good.

[Speaker 32] (2:54:27 - 2:54:30)
We're moving out of order to the bottom of this map.

[Speaker 65] (2:54:30 - 2:54:30)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:54:31 - 2:55:09)
So, moving on to the bottom of page nine. Out of order. Document number 20089-T1.

In the 31st Ward. Ordinance referred on July 24th of 19. Common address 4433 through 4439 West Fullerton Avenue.

Change request B23 Neighborhood Use, Mixed Use District to a B23 Neighborhood Mixed Use District. You've been the same? Okay.

Okay. So, difference is it'll be a T1. So, we have Mr. Silver.

[Speaker 27] (2:55:37 - 2:57:44)
Chairman, members of the committee. My name is Warren Silver. Silver Law Office PC.

Here today representing DAG 4433 W Fullerton LLC. The applicant with me is the manager of that LLC, Roger Daniel. A year ago, almost exactly a year ago, this property was rezoned from a B1-1 to a B2-3.

That was a type one rezoning. And the purpose of that was to rehab the commercial space on the first floor of the building which contained four underutilized or unutilized storefronts to create a dwelling unit and a business live work unit in two of those storefronts and then to retain the other two storefronts. One of the storefronts is rented but the other storefront that was being retained efforts to rent that for a business have not been successful.

And so, at this time, we're seeking to amend that type one plan to provide for a second dwelling unit on the first floor and to move the business live work unit that had been programmed shifted over one space into that commercial space that we'd been unable to rent. The 20 units above the ground floor are remaining as they were before. They will continue to remain and be occupied by their current tenants.

There will be a need with adding the one additional dwelling unit to seek a variation under section 17-13-1101-D of the zoning ordinance for relief from that parking requirement.

[Speaker 25] (2:57:49 - 2:57:49)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:57:49 - 2:57:57)
Questions by committee members? Alderman Cardona, would you like to speak on this issue? Alderman Cardona.

[Speaker 50] (2:57:58 - 2:58:26)
Thank you, Chairman. When Mr. Silver came to me and talked to me about it, I was very open to it because it's a great way of utilizing the space. So, I told him to do what he has to do.

I talked to the residents surrounding the building. I had a conversation with them and they were in support of it. So, I am here addressing that I'm supporting this zoning change.

[Speaker 1] (2:58:28 - 2:58:46)
Questions for the Alderman or the applicant? So, I have one little one. So, four commercial, potentially four commercial units, but by passing this ordinance, we'll have LIB work on the entire ground floor?

[Speaker 27] (2:58:47 - 2:59:35)
So, a year ago, there was a type one rezoning. So, what we're doing today is eliminating one of those storefront units that efforts have been made to rent. It was listed in COSTAR.

We can't find a tenant for it. And so, we're going to add one more dwelling unit on the first floor. And in doing so, shift the business LIB work one over.

So, there'll be one residential unit, one LIB workspace, and one more traditional Now, the end result will be one commercial space that's currently occupied, one business LIB work unit, and two dwelling units.

[Speaker 1] (2:59:36 - 3:01:06)
Thank you for that clarification. Great. Any other questions?

Committee members? If not, the motion by Alderman Lopez moves to pass. All those in favor?

Any opposed? Opinion of the Chair of the Ayes have it. And this item is passed.

Thank you very much. Okay. Back to the regular order on the top of page five.

Document number 20101-T1 in the 42nd Ward. Ordinance referred on July 24th of 19. Common address, 180 West Randolph Street.

Change request. Sent. What do we do?

Is it Alderman Miley? Do we have a letter of support for the Alderman? Okay.

Hold this one for a second. As soon as the Alderman gets back, we will put you back on front. So let's go down to the bottom of page five.

Document number 20106-T1 in the 37th Ward. Ordinance referred on July 24th of 19. Common address, 4201 West Division.

Change request, C11 Neighborhood Commercial District to an RM6 Residential Multi-Unit District. Counselor.

[Speaker 28] (3:01:07 - 3:02:04)
Good afternoon. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. I believe you already have a letter from Alderman Mitts in this ward.

We do. Very good. My name is Lawrence Lusk.

I have offices at 1030 West Chicago Avenue. I am an attorney representing Dibke LLC, the applicant in this matter. Sitting to my right is Daniel Bleier.

I'm sorry, Eric Kaplan, the other managing member of the Dibke LLC. And this applicant requests a zoning change from the current C11 to a proposed RM6 to allow the conversion of five first floor commercial spaces to five first floor residential units. This will result in a total of 13 residential units and no commercials remaining in the building.

We have met with Alderman Mitts and attended a community group meeting regarding our project, and we have received a letter of support from the Alderman. This project will require an application for a variance to reduce the required parking requirements also, and that'll come after this. We're available for any questions you may have, and we appreciate your consideration in this matter.

[Speaker 1] (3:02:06 - 3:02:23)
Okay, questions from committee members. Let me ask a quick question to the department on this one. Is there a way to accomplish this?

I know the Alderman is supportive of it. This is the one on 4201 West Division.

[Speaker 3] (3:02:25 - 3:02:27)
Oh, that was, oh, for the MLA reduction.

[Speaker 1] (3:02:29 - 3:02:39)
Is there a, I'm talking to the department about their recommendation and is there another way to handle it?

[Speaker 3] (3:02:39 - 3:03:01)
No, I mean it's not that there's a, well, let's say there's not a way to accomplish it as this plan. The difference of what they're doing is avoiding, in this case, a ground floor residential use. To not do this zoning change would result in a different project but would have a different review process to get the residential use below the ground floor.

[Speaker 1] (3:03:02 - 3:03:13)
And let me ask, in the context of the area, I know that, tell me, because it couldn't get that, we see a lot of changes, but this one is a little interesting.

[Speaker 3] (3:03:13 - 3:03:25)
I was just, I guess to clarify, I was just saying you couldn't get that level of density and it also wouldn't be the same type of project or review process because going from the C1 requires the ZBA appearance for the ground floor residential. Okay.

[Speaker 28] (3:03:26 - 3:04:17)
We actually met with zoning on a number of occasions in this matter. We were initially were going to do just three residential and two commercial and there was no way to accomplish that because you couldn't do both on the first floor. That's why we went to the full residential on the first floor.

But this is an area where they're really, they're having trouble with commercial spaces. So we thought about keeping the commercial space there on the first floor and it just wasn't viable. This was part of a project that contained a building behind it and both buildings were drug and gang house buildings.

They were both a lot of trouble for the neighborhood. CIC was involved in taking over the buildings. We then took it from CIC.

We bought it from CIC. There is an affordable component to that purchase. So even though we're not required under the ordinance, we do have an agreement with CIC to provide affordable housing and this really was what the community wanted with the additional residential.

[Speaker 65] (3:04:18 - 3:04:18)
Great.

[Speaker 1] (3:04:18 - 3:04:26)
So any questions from committee members? Hearing none. Alderman, is that a question?

Alderman, Alderman Cardona.

[Speaker 50] (3:04:27 - 3:04:32)
Out of all the apartments you said was affordability, how many apartments are affordable?

[Speaker 28] (3:04:32 - 3:04:56)
So there's a, this is, and Keeler's behind it, right? So there was two buildings in this project. I don't remember the exact one.

It was way over what? It's like 40% or something. It's more than 10%, the affordable.

And in this area, they'll all be affordable, basically. But it's more than 10% below 40%. Yeah, yeah, it's more than 10%.

[Speaker 1] (3:04:56 - 3:05:11)
Any more questions by committee? If not, Alderman Wolgisback moves to pass on this item. All those in favor?

Any opposed? Didn't hear the Chair of the Ayes have it. Item is passed.

[Speaker 28] (3:05:11 - 3:05:12)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (3:05:12 - 3:05:43)
Thank you. Moving to the top of page six, document number 20129T1 in the 36th Ward, ordinance referred on July 24th of 19, common address 1906 through 08 North Cicero Avenue. Change request, RS3, residential single unit detached house district to a C22 motor vehicle related commercial district.

All right.

[Speaker 5] (3:05:44 - 3:06:48)
Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, my name is Mark Kupiak. I'm an attorney with offices at 77 West Washington. I represent the applicant.

And on behalf of the applicant, I have with me today, Javier Herrera, who's seated beside me. And this property is already improved with a mixed use building with a large commercial space on the ground floor. And I've been advised that this building has been vacant for many years.

Javier has an existing business in the neighborhood. He builds and designs awnings and signs for businesses with their name and their logo on it. The businesses in the neighborhood, he'd like to move it to larger space.

And if the zoning change is successful, he would move his business into this building on the ground floor. And actually it's closer to his house also. He's been in to see and meet with the Alderman and the Alderman staff to describe his business, explain the project and ask for the Alderman's support.

And I think the Alderman hopefully has sent you a letter.

[Speaker 1] (3:06:49 - 3:08:15)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Villegas. Any questions from committee members? Hearing none, Alderman Beal moves, no, Alderman Beal wasn't listening to that one.

So, Alderman Osterman moves to pass on this item. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Opinions here, the ayes have it, item is passed. Thank you.

Good luck and let's keep the business moving, okay? All right, now we are on the middle of page six. This item number 20093T1 in the 35th Ward has a late deferral on this one for the attorney.

So, can I get a motion to defer on that one? Alderman Beal moves to defer, this item is deferred. Now, okay, all right, bottom of page six, number 20121-T1 in the 33rd Ward, ordinance referred July 24th of 19, common address 2448 West Diversity Avenue.

Change request, RS3 residential single unit detached house to a B23 neighborhood mixed use district.

[Speaker 13] (3:08:17 - 3:08:56)
Councilor. Afternoon, Chairman Tunney. I'm Dan Lauer, L-A-U-E-R.

I'm here with Mr. McGuire, Sean McGuire. He and his brother are contract purchasers of 2448 West Diversity. This is application 20121-T1.

And I wish I had a photo because this is a small frame between some larger buildings. The proposal is to go from RS3 to B23 for construction of a three-unit building with three garage parking spaces. We met with Alderman Rodriguez-Sanchez's staff and we have their support.

I spoke with her earlier today. I don't know if she is still here or not.

[Speaker 1] (3:09:06 - 3:09:10)
You were speaking to the alder person.

[Speaker 13] (3:09:10 - 3:09:22)
Yes, and she stated that this proposal has her support. And I said, in about an hour, Alderman, you could speak that and maybe she's no longer here.

[Speaker 31] (3:09:22 - 3:09:26)
So, are we going to hold it or are we going to pass it?

[Speaker 1] (3:09:28 - 3:09:35)
All right, let's hold it for a second. How long do you think this is going to be? Do we have some kind of a communication that can be emailed?

[Speaker 13] (3:09:35 - 3:09:40)
I expected her, I don't know if anybody's aware, but I expected her to be here when the case was called.

[Speaker 1] (3:09:40 - 3:09:54)
Okay, all right, let's hold it and let's see if we can somehow reach the alder woman. Oh, okay, what page are we?

[Speaker 13] (3:09:54 - 3:10:03)
Okay, we're going to hold. Thanks, Mr. Chairman, when we get a break, I'll go to her ward office, the city hall office. Great, thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:10:03 - 3:10:33)
All righty, so back to 180 West Randolph, item number 201-01T, 142nd Ward, ordinance referred on July 24th of 19. Change request, central area parking plan development number 997 to DC16, downtown core district. Paul, do you want to start?

[Speaker 36] (3:10:34 - 3:11:11)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman. My name is Paul Shadle. I'm with the law firm of DLA Piper located at 444 West Lake Street and with my colleague, Liz Butler, represent 180 West Randolph, LLC, the application for a zoning map amendment for the subject property.

With us today are Chris Oakley from the applicant, Steve Cummings from DLR, the project architect, and Peter Lemon from Kinley Horn, our traffic consultant. We'd also ask that the substitute plan be incorporated into the record.

[Speaker 1] (3:11:12 - 3:11:23)
Okay, Alderman Ravois moves to accept the substantive narrative and plans for this type one application. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? The ayes have it, plans are accepted.

[Speaker 36] (3:11:24 - 3:13:05)
As noted, the request to change is from the central area parking plan development number 997 to the DC-16 downtown core district, and it's a type one request, which would, if approved, allow for the construction and operation of a 13-story hotel containing a maximum of 310 hotel rooms. The elevations are in the overhead and in front of you. The property contains approximately 14,400 square feet of site area.

It's bounded by Randolph. On the south, a 45-story commercial building, 188 West Randolph to the west, West Couch Place on the north, and an existing 22-story commercial building owned by the state of Illinois to the east. It's concurrently improved with a surface parking lot that no longer operates.

The overall building height would be approximately 140 feet, and the overall project FAR is expected to be 11.8, which is less than the maximum permitted of 16. Again, if you refer to the site plan, the hotel will be served by two loading zones, a valet loading zone of approximately 75 feet in length on Randolph, and a pickup zone of approximately 50 feet on Couch Place. Because the hotel will contain less than 15,000 square feet of meeting space, no parking would be required.

Our team is available to answer any questions that you have. We've worked with Alderman Riley and the Department of Planning and Development on this project, and it's our understanding that Alderman Riley supports it. We respectfully request that you recommend that the City Council approve the application and appreciate your time and consideration.

[Speaker 45] (3:13:07 - 3:13:07)
This is the middle?

[Speaker 36] (3:13:08 - 3:13:16)
Yes, so on that elevation that you see there, it's the short building in the middle. The building on the left side of that plan is 188.

[Speaker 1] (3:13:18 - 3:13:19)
All right, Alderman Riley.

[Speaker 49] (3:13:22 - 3:15:05)
Thank you, Chairman and fellow members of the Zoning Committee. As you all know, this is an undeveloped site that's been sitting generally dormant for the better part of the last 10 years. There have been various plans that have been presented for this site, but I think this one is an appropriate use, especially the scale of the use, and obviously will be welcome infill on the street wall on this very well-traveled section of Randolph Street, our busiest pedestrian street in the Loop.

So I think this is a site that's been begging for development for quite some time. I'm glad that the development team here has worked with my office, the City Planning Department, CDOT, to evaluate their proposal. One sensitivity with this site was related to its proximity to the Randolph bike lane and how loading would be handled.

And working with CDOT, we were able to come up with a special configuration in front of the hotel to allow for some curbside usage. It's been agreed with CDOT that if that poses safety conflicts for bike lane users and pedestrians, that we may elect to push more of the loading into the alley north of the hotel site. But to start, we're going to give the curbside solution a try.

That's probably the most sensitive component of the project. Obviously, it would be modest in size compared to other projects that are proposed in the Loop proper. I'd be happy to answer any questions, but I do support the project and I would encourage an aye vote.

[Speaker 1] (3:15:10 - 3:15:52)
Questions for the Alderman? Hearing no questions, do I have a motion to move to pass with a substitute narrative and plans? Do I have a motion?

Alderman Roboyas makes the motion. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? I'm hearing none. This item is passed.

A narrative moving forward. Can we make sure that we get pictures fine, but the floor plan and stuff like that? Can we get it so the audience can...

Oh, I'm sorry. It was our... Thank you.

Blame it on staff. Okay, great. Next.

Thank you, thank you.

[Speaker 65] (3:16:13 - 3:16:14)
Where were we at?

[Speaker 16] (3:16:14 - 3:16:15)
We are on the bottom.

[Speaker 1] (3:16:15 - 3:16:19)
You know, I'm going to be able to, but you know, stick to zoning topics.

[Speaker 32] (3:16:20 - 3:16:21)
We're going to move to the top of page seven.

[Speaker 1] (3:16:22 - 3:16:51)
All right. Top of page seven, item number 20090-T1 in the 33rd ward. Ordinance referred on July 24th of 19.

Address, common address, 2973 North Elston Avenue. Change request, M12 limited manufacturing business park district to an RT4 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district. Counselor?

[Speaker 5] (3:16:52 - 3:17:47)
Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, my name is Mark Kupiak. I'm an attorney with offices at 77 West Washington. I represent the applicant, Jessica Walters, who's present and seated beside me.

Asking for a zoning change, a zoning of the subject property from manufacturing to residential. The purpose is so Jessica can continue the residential use within the existing residential building on the subject property. An older residential building.

She bought the property with the residential building on it. Currently has a tenant. The impetus for the zoning change was the tenant was trying to establish a shared housing unit, which he could only do if the property's zoned residential.

And without the zoning change, she would lose that tenant. She's been in there to see the alderman and explain her situation, explain the proposed use and ask for the alderman's support. And I believe the alderman has, in fact, written a letter to the committee.

[Speaker 1] (3:17:48 - 3:17:51)
We do have a letter from Alderman Rodriguez-Sanchez. Thank you.

[Speaker 5] (3:17:51 - 3:18:02)
Oh, Mr. Chairman, a procedural matter that I forgot to mention. We did submit a substitute plans and a substitute narrative. There was one little small issue that we clarified.

[Speaker 1] (3:18:02 - 3:19:12)
Alderman Ravois moved to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type one application. I moved all those in favor. Aye.

Any opposed? Ayes have it. The narrative and plans are accepted.

Questions? We do have a letter of support from Alderman Rodriguez-Sanchez. And questions for the applicant?

Hearing no questions, then I would like a motion move to pass with the substitute narrative and plans. Done by Alderman Burnett. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? Opinion Chair, the ayes have it.

This item is passed. Thank you. Thank you.

And thank you for your patience. All right. Next, middle of page seven.

Item number 20123-T1, 32nd Ward. Ordinance referred on July 24th of 19. Common address, 2016 West Webster Avenue.

Change request B22 Neighborhood Mixed-Use District to B23 Neighborhood Mixed-Use District. Dan, counselor?

[Speaker 13] (3:19:13 - 3:19:23)
Afternoon again, Mr. Chairman. This is 2016 West Webster 20123 type one. There's a housekeeping matter.

There's a substitute narrative and plan, sir. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (3:19:24 - 3:19:25)
For the record, identify yourself again.

[Speaker 13] (3:19:25 - 3:19:30)
Oh, Daniel Lauer, L-A-U-E-R, for the applicant, EZMB LLC.

[Speaker 1] (3:19:30 - 3:19:46)
Great. So, Alderman Rabois moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for this type one application. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? Hearing none, the ayes have it.

And the substitute narrative and plans are before us.

[Speaker 13] (3:19:46 - 3:20:45)
This is B22 to B23, Mr. Chairman, for construction of three condominiums. It's a non-standard lot, and the original intention was to change to dash two and then go to the Zoning Board of Appeals for the lack of minimum lot area. The lot is less than 3,000 square feet.

Ironically, you were naming alternate members of the ZBA. There weren't enough votes at the ZBA when this appeared earlier this year. And so, Alderman Wagaspak, after thoroughly vetting this, has kindly now allowed us to change to B23 for the same building size.

No change in the building. Just the number of dwelling units allowed is three units, which was always the intention, had the Zoning Board of Appeals cooperated. So, we've agreed that we'll down zone this to B22 after the receipt of the building permit.

And we have a letter of support from the Alderman who's here this afternoon.

[Speaker 1] (3:20:46 - 3:20:48)
Thank you, Dan. Alderman Wagaspak.

[Speaker 22] (3:20:49 - 3:21:09)
Chairman, that is correct the way that was discussed. It's interesting because the ZBA, without that one person, was not able to move forward on our preferred situation there. So, we're asking for the committee's most favorable consideration of this proposal.

[Speaker 53] (3:21:09 - 3:21:10)
Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (3:21:10 - 3:21:37)
Questions for the Alderman or the applicant? So, no more questions. I'm asking for a motion to pass with substitute narrative and plans.

Moved by Alderman Roboyes. All those in favor? The aye.

Any opposed? Opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it and the item is passed. While we have you, Dan, are we going to go back to?

[Speaker 65] (3:21:37 - 3:21:41)
We are going to go back and defer the bottom of page 6.

[Speaker 1] (3:21:41 - 3:22:07)
Okay. So, let's revisit application number 20121T1 in the 33rd Ward. And at the request of the Alderman, she's asking to defer this.

So, can I have a motion to defer? Moved by Riley. All those in favor?

[Speaker 13] (3:22:08 - 3:22:11)
On a date certain, Mr. Chairman, would it be the very next?

[Speaker 1] (3:22:11 - 3:22:23)
I'm assuming with your cooperation with the local Alderman. Yes, please. So, this item is deferred and thank you for your patience too.

Good luck on that one. Thank you.

[Speaker 13] (3:22:24 - 3:22:27)
So, we're done. Okay, we're done. The next one is.

[Speaker 1] (3:22:28 - 3:23:10)
Oh, I'm sorry. Okay. So, let's move to this one.

Yep. Okay. Bottom of page 7.

Number 20120 in T1. 20120-T1, 32nd Ward. Ordinance referred on July 24th of 19.

Common address 1545 through 1549 West Diversity Parkway. Change request. M12 Limited Manufacturing Business Park District and RT4 Residential Two-Flat Townhouse and Multi-Unit District to RT4 Residential Two-Flat Townhouse and Multi-Unit District.

[Speaker 13] (3:23:10 - 3:24:06)
Okay. Counselor. Mr. Chairman, Daniel Lauer, LAUER. Again, on behalf of Mr. Jimmy Banyas, B-A-N-Y-S of EZMB. This is 1545-49 West Diversity. It's a type one.

There's no substitution. It's split zoning, Mr. Chairman. It's part M12 and the rest RT4.

Their proposal is to change the entire site to RT4 for two separate buildings. After discussions with the alderman and his staff in the West DePaul Neighborhood Association, they wanted two separate three-unit buildings which appear to be built by different developers at different times. And Mr. Banyas has agreed to that. So, we certainly want to thank Paul Sijovic and Alderman Waguespack for their review and their support. Alderman? Yes.

[Speaker 22] (3:24:06 - 3:24:37)
Chairman, thank you. This is, as you can see there from the description, we have several of these for some reason in the ward that, you know, exist from the old zoning map. But we did work with them closely on this and I would just ask for the committee's most favorable vote on this as well.

This is what? Is this near Lakewood? Yes.

It's Old Railroad right away. South Lakeview Neighbors, actually. And West DePaul.

Questions for the alderman or the applicant?

[Speaker 1] (3:24:41 - 3:24:54)
Okay. Motion to pass by Alderman Raboias. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? The chair of the ayes have it.

Item is passed. Thank you. Okay.

[Speaker 65] (3:25:01 - 3:25:01)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (3:25:02 - 3:25:24)
Again, in the 32nd ward, item number 20082-T1. Ordinance is referred on July 24th. Common address 2641 through 45, North Clybourne Avenue.

Change request M23 Light Industry District to a B21 Neighborhood Mixed Use District.

[Speaker 6] (3:25:25 - 3:26:47)
Mr. Moore. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name for the record is Thomas S.

Moore. With me today is Christine Ngo. Christine inherited this property from her dad, who was the longtime owner of it.

While it was zoned manufacturing, the reality is that it had residences on the top and businesses on the bottom. And it's a couple of buildings. It's an odd little triangular zoning lot.

The one building has been empty. It used to be a salon, and it's been empty for many years. And it's not in a really very good commercial area to fill it.

She has tried and tried. And as a result, she'd like to renovate it into a residence. It has a very nice yard and parking.

And it would fit right in with the other residence upstairs and next door. And so we have gone through the alderman, and we're requesting a zoning that really reflects what is there, in fact, and would allow her to renovate this one unit into a residential unit. And we'd ask for your support as well.

[Speaker 65] (3:26:48 - 3:26:48)
All right.

[Speaker 22] (3:26:50 - 3:27:25)
Alderman Wagesberg. Thank you, Chairman. As Mr. Moore said, and from the description, this is a building that sits right on Clybourne next to Menard. So it's sort of a strange angle. Seems like the last couple of properties the same way, where they're cut off by an adjacent alley or street that shortens the lots. But we're happy to move forward with this change because it maintains the outside yard for green space for the residents.

And I think it's a good use of the property. So I would ask for the committee's most favorable vote.

[Speaker 1] (3:27:27 - 3:28:19)
Questions for the alderman or the applicant? Hearing none. Alderman Osterman moves a motion do pass.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

Opinion Chair, the ayes have it. Item is passed. You'll be able to do your shopping at Menard's for this backyard, I think.

Let's hope it stays that way for the next 30 years. I don't know about that. Good luck to you.

All right. What are we on to now? Bottom of page eight.

Item number 20080T1 in the 32nd Ward. Ordinance referred July 24th of 19. This common address 2333 West Montana.

Change request M12 limited manufacturing business park district to an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district. Yes, Mr. Moore.

[Speaker 6] (3:28:19 - 3:29:23)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name, for the record, is Thomas S. Moore.

And with me today is Jonathan Clem, the owner of the property. This has been a comedy of errors. A couple of years ago, I was not involved.

There was a rezoning to accomplish the same thing we're still trying to accomplish. And that is really to free up a vacant lot next door. But because historically this lot and the lot next door are one zoning lot, this lot has to be compliant before the two lots could be split.

And a single family home could be built on the lot next door once this lot becomes compliant. So the purpose of this zoning is to make this lot compliant with what is, in fact, there, a two-flat that's been there for decades. And once it is compliant, the ultimate goal will be to make the lot next door viable for building a single family home.

[Speaker 1] (3:29:27 - 3:29:29)
Again, Alderman Wagesbeck, do you want to comment on this?

[Speaker 22] (3:29:30 - 3:30:03)
Thank you, Chairman. And the comedy of errors was not attributable to Mr. Moore, for sure. This just assists in getting this property correctly zoned and for the owner to move forward with a legalized space.

So we have a lot of these split lots where it's M on one side and RT4, and just trying to get them into conformance with the code and allow for people to live there legally. So I would just ask for the committee's most favorable vote.

[Speaker 1] (3:30:06 - 3:30:22)
All right. Questions for the Alderman or the applicant? Hearing none, Alderman Roboyesbu's do pass on this item.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

Penny and Chair, the ayes have it. And this item is passed.

[Speaker 6] (3:30:22 - 3:30:23)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (3:30:23 - 3:30:56)
Luck to you, Mr. Clem. All right. Bottom of page nine.

We did that one, didn't we? OK. Moving along.

Top of page 10. Document number 20070, 30th Ward. Ordinance referred on July 24th of 19.

Common address, 3820 West Diversity Parkway. I have a question about that.

[Speaker 6] (3:30:57 - 3:30:57)
About which?

[Speaker 1] (3:30:58 - 3:32:00)
Is 3800 West Diversity a street or a parkway? I'll defer to the Alderman. Diversity Avenue.

It says parkway. And I'm not going to elaborate why I know that. It's a comedy of errors.

Alderman, walk us back. OK. So it's 3820 West Diversity Avenue.

Change request, RS3 residential single unit detached house district to a C21 motor vehicle related commercial district. I have to laugh. I think you can laugh with me on that one.

OK. Diversity is a parkway from the lake to Western. And from Western West, it is an avenue.

I live on Diversity Parkway. And I will not tell you the rest of the story. All right.

So let's go, Counselor.

[Speaker 6] (3:32:00 - 3:32:49)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name, for the record, is Thomas S. Moore.

And with me today is Javier Medina. Mr. Medina has run a very well thought of car repair shop at this location for many, many years. And it's a non-conforming property.

It's zoned residential. But he's run this business legally and properly. However, he has a signage problem.

And he can't get a permit to fix his signage because it's zoned residential. So the purpose of today's request is to make the property compliant with what really goes on there so that he can also come into compliance on his signage.

[Speaker 1] (3:32:53 - 3:32:57)
All right. Alderman Robles.

[Speaker 47] (3:32:58 - 3:33:11)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Javier Medina has been there for a number of years. And he employs folks from the community.

He's very active in the community. So I hope we get the support that's needed so he can remain as a business owner in that community.

[Speaker 1] (3:33:13 - 3:34:18)
Obviously, this is not, unfortunately, it's a more common problem than we think. And I would love to find a way without a zoning change on these. But we've already had this discussion.

All right. Questions for the alderman or the applicant? If not, do I have a motion?

Move to pass by Alderman Beall. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Opinion chair, the ayes have it. And the item is passed.

Thank you very much. Moving on in the 30th Ward. Are we to the middle of page 10?

Document number 20075, 30th Ward ordinance referred on July 24th of 19. Common address 6309 West Diversity Avenue. Change request, RS3 residential single unit detached house district to a C11 neighborhood commercial district.

[Speaker 61] (3:34:22 - 3:34:23)
Councilor?

[Speaker 5] (3:34:23 - 3:35:31)
Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, my name is Mark Kupiak. I'm an attorney with offices at 77 West Washington. And I represent the applicant, Susan Narvaez, who's present and seated beside me.

And looking to rezone this property. And the property is presently improved. A little misleading residential building in the back, but a existing one-story commercial building at the front of the lot.

Our research disclosed that perhaps the last use of this commercial building was for a real estate or mortgage loan office, but we couldn't find any licensing records. So looking to rezone it so Susan could come in and use the commercial building for a beauty salon. And her proposal is to work there herself with her two daughters, one of whom is a cosmetologist and the other is an esthetician.

At the alderman's request, we did send out notices and had a community meeting. And she explained the proposed use. And we followed up with the alderman and his staff to ask for his support.

[Speaker 65] (3:35:33 - 3:35:34)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (3:35:34 - 3:35:37)
I think we have a letter of support from Alderman Raboyas.

[Speaker 42] (3:35:40 - 3:35:40)
Alderman?

[Speaker 47] (3:35:42 - 3:35:56)
As the council stated, we had a community meeting and there's no opposition. It's an empty storefront. It's been there for years.

I'd like to get it put to use. And I hope to get your support on this.

[Speaker 1] (3:35:57 - 3:36:36)
Any questions for the alderman or the applicant? Hearing none, Alderman Wagesback moves do pass. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? Opinion in the chair of the ayes have it.

Item is passed. Now we're going to be on the bottom of page 10. Document number 20105, 30th Ward.

Ordinance referred on July 24th of 19. Common address 3614 West Diversity Avenue. Change request B31 Community Shopping District to a B22 Neighborhood Mixed Use District.

Councilor? Where is my gavel?

[Speaker 28] (3:36:38 - 3:37:31)
Good afternoon. You want me to go really quick? Is that what you're saying?

Afternoon, colleagues. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My name is Lawrence Lesko.

Office of 1030 West Chicago Avenue. And I'm the attorney representing 3614 West Diversity LLC. Sitting to my right is Paul Sekar, the managing member of the LLC.

The application request has only changed from B31 to a proposed B22 to permit the construction of a four-story, six-unit residential building on what is now a vacant surface parking lot. This is the second project for this developer on this same block. They actually built the building next door, which is substantially similar.

We met with Alderman Roboyes. Talked at a community group meeting, and we are not aware of any objectives in this matter. I know Alderman Roboyes is here.

He submitted a letter in support. I have a copy of that letter if you need it. More available for any questions you may have.

How was that? All right.

[Speaker 1] (3:37:33 - 3:37:38)
Again, we have a letter of support from Alderman, and he's here. Alderman Roboyes.

[Speaker 47] (3:37:38 - 3:37:42)
Thank you, we're in full support. We had a community meeting, and it was well supported. So thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:37:43 - 3:37:53)
Okay. So moved by Alderman Beal. Moves do pass on this item.

All those in favor? Aye. Aye.

Any opposed? Hearing none, this item is passed.

[Speaker 28] (3:37:54 - 3:38:04)
Thank you very much, Larry. Me, by asking if we could do this, and I was misunderstanding what you were asking. So I appreciate that.

We're good.

[Speaker 1] (3:38:04 - 3:38:29)
We're good. Middle of page 11. Document number 20078-T1, 29th Ward.

Ordinance referred on July 24th of 19. Common address, 1654 North Merrimack Avenue. Change request from an RS3, residential single unit detached house district, to an RM5.5, residential multi-unit district.

[Speaker 6] (3:38:31 - 3:39:12)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name for the record is Thomas S. Moore.

With me today is the owner of the property, John Wormack, and also Marty Cerny, who runs a program to create affordable and accessible property called Housing Plus. This request, Mr. Wormack has a huge basement that has room to have light and air. And therefore, he'd like to add these three units.

He went through a process with the alderman. We have a letter of support from the alderman, and we'd ask for your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (3:39:14 - 3:39:30)
We do have a letter of support with Alderman Telefaro. Any questions by committee members? Mr. Cerny, did you want to say something?

Okay, do you have a narrative here? Get quick to it.

[Speaker 55] (3:39:30 - 3:40:55)
I will. It's important to publicly acknowledge today, Marca Bristow, my humble 501c3 entity, Housing Plus, along with the entire city of Chicago, lost a treasure Sunday with her passing. Among her mountain of accomplishments, Marca was instrumental in effecting Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.

She was a member of President Clinton's Administration on Fair Housing, and she developed Access Living into one of the world's premier advocacy organizations for people with disabilities. Marca was an active member of my Housing Plus advisory board for 11 years, and an inspiration to me and many others associated with Housing Plus. Marca would thank John here for volunteering his property to create three additional units, one fully accessible, the other two being livable for people with modest mobility difficulties, and she certainly would thank Alderman Telefaro for his kind support.

Marca would consider this a modest project as an important victory in a campaign that has a very long way to go. Marca would then encourage that incentives be defined and offered to multi-family properties like John that make it easier to choose to volunteer and add this type of important housing stock, which can be done all across the city, to an otherwise depleted inventory. Period.

[Speaker 1] (3:40:56 - 3:41:06)
Thank you, Marty. And we all know Marca. She was an amazing woman that testified here on many, many occasions, and we certainly will miss her.

[Speaker 55] (3:41:06 - 3:41:06)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (3:41:10 - 3:41:56)
All right. So, questions, comments by committee members? Hearing none, Alderman Beal, moves do pass.

All in favor, say aye. Any opposed? In the chair, the ayes have it.

Item is passed. Thank you very much. All right.

All right. Middle of page 12. Item number 20118 in the 27th ward ordinance referred on July 24th of 19.

Common address, 303 West Division, 1140 North Wells, 202 West Hill, change request, plan development 136 to plan development 136 as we attempt to amend.

[Speaker 65] (3:41:57 - 3:41:58)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:41:58 - 3:41:58)
All right.

[Speaker 53] (3:42:00 - 3:42:30)
Counselor, Ed? Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My name is Ed Kuss with the Taft Law Firm located at 111 East Wacker in Chicago.

I'm appearing this afternoon on behalf of Ani Atrium Apartments Limited Partnership. And present and joining me this afternoon is Mr. Brian Brodeur, Director of Development. As a preliminary matter, Mr. Chairman, I would ask that the record of proceedings from the August 15th, 2019 Chicago Plan Commission meeting be incorporated into this hearing.

[Speaker 1] (3:42:33 - 3:42:46)
All right. That being said, I'm going to ask Alderman Riley moves to incorporate the records from the Plan Commission. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it.

And these records are now incorporated.

[Speaker 53] (3:42:47 - 3:43:39)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is an amendment to PD 136. This is a technical amendment.

And I say technical because there's no new construction proposed. And there are no physical changes to the existing buildings on site. The purpose of the technical amendment is to add two uses to the PD.

One, the shared housing use. And second, up to 60 hotel units among the four buildings on site. The hotel units will be furnished apartments.

And the purpose is to provide short-term extended stays. This will not affect the total number of residential units, will not affect any other development approvals on site. That being said, Mr. Chairman, that is it. It's a highly technical amendment just to permit hotel and shared housing uses.

[Speaker 1] (3:43:40 - 3:43:47)
Great. Alderman Burnett, Division and Hill.

[Speaker 15] (3:43:47 - 3:43:48)
Yeah.

[Speaker 2] (3:43:50 - 3:44:31)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. As the council has said, this is just a technical change. It won't be a new building.

It's a building that's already up. We actually, though, because of wanting to do the extended rooms instead of the apartments, we sent them back to the local community organization that originally approved the zoning change for this development, which is the Old Town Merchants and Residents. The Old Town Merchants and Residents made an agreement with them.

They agreed to allow them to do extended stay with one caveat, and that was?

[Speaker 53] (3:44:32 - 3:44:34)
Well, that there be a limit of 60 units.

[Speaker 2] (3:44:35 - 3:44:39)
That there be a limit of 60 units, although the building allowed for how many units?

[Speaker 53] (3:44:41 - 3:44:45)
Well, over 1,200 market rates, 1,500 total. Okay.

[Speaker 2] (3:44:46 - 3:45:19)
And one of the other things, Mr. Chairman, so you know with this overall development, there was an agreement for 20% affordable housing. Although they're doing a 60% 60 units for extended stay, it will not decrease the number of affordable units that's supposed to be built on the overall development. That is correct.

With that and with the community supporting it, I ask for this committee's support with this proposal. Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (3:45:20 - 3:46:15)
Thank you, Alderman. Questions for Alderman Burnett or the applicants? Hearing no questions, Alderman Moore, moves to pass.

All in favor, say aye. Any opposed? The chair of the ayes have it.

This item will be passed as revised. I'm sorry. Passed as revised.

Thank you very much. Thank you, Alderman. All right.

Back now, we're going to go to the top. Page 13 on the top. Okay.

So, all right. Applicant number or the number is 20112, 27th ward ordinance referred on July 24th. Common address 800 West Lake Street.

So this item has not been before the plan commission. Wait a second.

[Speaker 53] (3:46:16 - 3:46:19)
Are we on the top?

[Speaker 1] (3:46:22 - 3:46:27)
Why would it be Alderman Dowell? It says it's in the.

[Speaker 32] (3:46:28 - 3:46:29)
No, no.

[Speaker 1] (3:46:30 - 3:46:38)
Oh, okay. Nothing? Let me repeat.

I'm sorry. I'll start over. It's my first year.

Come on, you guys.

[Speaker 42] (3:46:39 - 3:46:39)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (3:46:40 - 3:47:38)
All right. Document number 20112, 27th ward ordinance referred on July 24th of 19. Common address 800 West Lake Street.

This item has not been before the plan commission. And Alderman Dowell makes a motion to defer. All those in favor?

To defer. Any opposed? This item, this item is going to be deferred.

Thank you for the clarification. All right. Now we're again on page 13.

Document number 20092T1 in the 27th ward ordinance referred on July 24th of 19. This address, common address 933 through 37 North Orleans Street. Change request.

B32 Community Shopping District to a B23 Neighborhood Mixed Use District.

[Speaker 50] (3:47:40 - 3:48:23)
All right. Nick, come on. Counselor.

Thank you, sir. For the record, Nick Feticus from the Law Offices of Sam Banks. I'm here on behalf of I Development Incorporated, both the applicant and property owner concerning the subject property at 933 through 937 North Orleans.

We're seeking a zoning change to establish a B2-3 Zoning District to permit a nine-unit residential building. The building will be supported by five on-site parking spaces. It is within 1,320 feet of the CTA Brown Line and is therefore transit-oriented development eligible.

We have worked with the Alderman's Office as well as the Near North Unity Program. We're not aware of any pending objection. Of course, we'll defer to the Alderman for final comment.

[Speaker 1] (3:48:24 - 3:48:25)
Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 2] (3:48:26 - 3:48:51)
Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. As he said, he did meet with myself and the Near North Unity Program, which is a community organization on the Near North side where the residents come and vet developments.

At that meeting, all of the members of the meeting supported the development. So I ask for his body to support it also.

[Speaker 1] (3:48:56 - 3:49:10)
Any questions for committee members? We have a motion by Alderman Beall. Moves do pass.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

Opinion Chair, the ayes have it. Item is passed.

[Speaker 50] (3:49:11 - 3:49:11)
Thank you, sir.

[Speaker 1] (3:49:11 - 3:49:33)
Bottom page 13. Document number 20074 in the 27th Ward. Ordinance referred on July 24th of 19.

Common address 2337 through 45 West Lake Street. Change request. C12 Neighborhood Commercial District to a C22 Motor Vehicle Related Commercial District.

[Speaker 52] (3:49:35 - 3:49:36)
Mark, applicants.

[Speaker 5] (3:49:38 - 3:50:37)
Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, my name is Mark Kupiec. I'm an attorney with offices at 77 West Washington. Represent the applicant that I have with me.

On behalf of the applicant, I've got Tara Robertson seated beside me. We also have her husband, Willie Hill, who's helping her in this venture. Properties improved with a building and a side lot.

Actually, it's zone C1. She proposes a dog daycare, dog kennel business. And actually, the C1's fine for the basic doggy daycare, except that she's got the side lot next door to exercise the dogs outdoors.

So we need the C2 zoning to allow the outdoor activity. And this particular property, it's right under the L tracks, if you can envision there on Lake Street. So probably a very good spot for the doggy daycare with the outdoor exercise.

Tara's been in to see Alderman Burnett. I've been advised several times to explain the project, explain her predicament, and ask him for his support.

[Speaker 2] (3:50:39 - 3:51:47)
Alderman? Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. These residents did go before a community organization, which is the neighbors of Westtown.

The neighbors didn't have a problem with this zoning change in order to allow for them to be able to use the vacant land that has been desolate for a long time. For a dog roaming area. Actually, they already planted artificial turf there.

It's very beautiful. I think this couple here, this young couple here, who owns this facility, is the only African-American couple that I know of to have a doggy daycare. So we're very encouraged and proud of them.

They have a beautiful space, very professional, and they have a lot of, there's a lot of dogs that go there. So I ask for the committee's support for this business.

[Speaker 1] (3:51:49 - 3:52:07)
Thank you, Alderman. Any questions for the applicant or Alderman Burnett? Hearing none, Alderman Beal moves to pass on this item.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

Opinion chair, the ayes have it. Item is passed. Thank you and get back to work.

I know you've been here a long time.

[Speaker 25] (3:52:07 - 3:52:08)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (3:52:08 - 3:52:35)
Watching the kennel. All right, middle of page 14. Item number 20068T1 in the 27th ward.

Ordinance referred on the 24th of July of 19. Common address, 1447 West Superior. Change request.

RS3 residential single unit detached house district to a B23 neighborhood mixed use district.

[Speaker 9] (3:52:38 - 3:53:56)
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Tyler Manick of the Shane Banks Law Firm.

I'm here with Michael Shinoda, one of the principals of the applicant, 1447 Superior Holdings LLC, which owns a property at 1447 West Superior. The property is a transit serve location. It has an existing two and a half story building that was last used as 34 bed convent with office space for Holy Innocence Parish.

It hasn't been used for several years. The applicant purchased the building to adaptively reuse the building. The existing building is a 16 unit apartment building.

No changes are being proposed to the physical size of the building. The exterior work will be limited to restoration work. To accomplish this renovation, the applicant seeks a zoning amendment to a B23 neighborhood mixed use district.

The applicant has worked with both Eckerd Park Community Council and the local neighbors in a series of meetings, which ultimate to refine the scope of this proposal, which ultimately led to their support. And I believe Alderman Burnett is here to confirm his support for this project too. In addition, before I finish the presentation, we have substitute narrative and plans that we would like to incorporate.

[Speaker 1] (3:53:58 - 3:54:09)
So Alderman Beal moves to accept a substitute narrative and plans for the type one application. All in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Hearing none, the substantive narrative and plans are before us.

[Speaker 2] (3:54:11 - 3:54:11)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (3:54:12 - 3:54:14)
So Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 2] (3:54:14 - 3:54:59)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. As the council has said, we did have a community meeting about this. Also sent them to the local community organization, which in this case is the Eckerd Park Community Council.

This property actually has gone through a couple of hands and a couple of renditions. And this group here has been able to accommodate the residents with their concerns in regards to parking and some other things. We're very happy to see this vacant property finally get some use.

And I'm sure the Archdiocese is happy to be able to unload this property so they can get much needed money that they need. So I ask for this committee's support for this project.

[Speaker 1] (3:55:00 - 3:55:13)
Thank you, Alderman. Any questions for Alderman Burnett? Hearing none, I would like to pass this with substantive narrative and plans.

Do I have a motion? So Alderman Beal moves. All those in favor?

[Speaker 65] (3:55:13 - 3:55:13)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (3:55:13 - 3:55:20)
Any opposed? Hearing none, the item is passed with substantive narrative and plans.

[Speaker 31] (3:55:20 - 3:55:21)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:55:21 - 3:56:03)
Thank you. Now we're going to stay in the 27th. Moving to the deferred agenda, page 26, document number 20063-T1 in the 27th Ward Ordinance Referred, June 12th of 19, Common Address 401-425 North Morgan, 932-954 West Kinsey, and 400-424 North Sangamon.

The change request, M23 Light Industry District to a DS5 Downtown Service District. Counselor?

[Speaker 53] (3:56:03 - 3:56:05)
Thank you.

[Speaker 8] (3:56:05 - 3:56:43)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Katie Jinkydale from the law firm of DLA Piper, located at 444 West Lake, and I, along with my colleague Liz Butler, represent 401 Morgan LLC, the applicant for a Type 1 Zoning Map Amendment for the property located at 401 North Morgan. As a preliminary matter, given that this property is in the Kinsey Industrial Corridor, the application required Planning Commission review for map amendments in the Industrial Corridor and was considered by the Planning Commission on August 16, 2019.

We respectfully request that the findings and transcript from the Planning Commission hearing be incorporated into the record here today.

[Speaker 1] (3:56:44 - 3:56:54)
So Alderman Beal moves to accept the plans from the Planning Commission. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? So the plans are incorporated.

[Speaker 8] (3:56:54 - 3:58:25)
Thank you. With me today are A.G. Hollis on behalf of the applicant and James Benjamin of Door 13, the project architect. The applicant seeks to rezone the property from the M23 Light Industry District to the DS5 Downtown Service District to allow the continuation of the existing Morgan manufacturing use and to allow the applicant to activate an existing outdoor rooftop patio to serve the existing use and operation.

No new improvements are proposed. The site is located on the northwest corner of Morgan and Kinsey and consists of approximately 58,451 square feet of site area. It's currently occupied by an existing building with height varying from one to four stories containing event space and other commercial uses and a surface parking lot.

The existing improvements and restaurant on the site have existed since 2013. The event space, Morgan Manufacturing, has been open since 2014. The applicant proposes to utilize an existing outdoor rooftop patio to serve the indoor special event space.

As noted earlier, no exterior construction or other changes to the building or operations are contemplated in connection with approval of this zoning change. Additionally, the requested zoning change triggers the industrial conversion fee which will result in a payment of $716,024 into the Industrial Corridor System Fund. We've worked with Alderman Burnett, the neighbors of River West and the Department of Planning and Development on this project and understand that Alderman is in support of the requested change.

Our team is available to answer any questions you may have and we respectfully request you recommend City Council approval of this application. Thank you.

[Speaker 2] (3:58:26 - 3:59:28)
Alderman Burnett. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. As the councillor said, they did meet with the local community organization.

They had several meetings in regards to this. There are several organizations that overlap this area but the community organization that they met with is actually the most effective residential community organization that has given their input. You know, over in the industrial area, one of the things is that you can have spaces in the industrial area but you can't have rooftops, right?

Since we took this out of the PMD, it allowed for them to be able to make this change so they're taking advantage of the situation in order to be able to utilize the rooftop. I think there may be some adjustments for rooftops in the future in some of the other buildings in this area. So the community support it, I support it and I ask for the committee's support.

[Speaker 1] (3:59:29 - 3:59:47)
Questions for Alderman Burnett or the applicant? Hearing none, I have a motion by Alderman Lopez, moves to pass as revised. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? Continuing to share the ayes have it and this is passed as revised.

[Speaker 2] (3:59:47 - 3:59:53)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman for allowing the 27 ward things all to come up at the same time. Appreciate it.

[Speaker 1] (3:59:53 - 4:00:21)
Thank you, Alderman and we'll stay on page 26 in the deferred agenda for item number 20008-T1 in the first ward ordinance referred on April 10th of 19, common address 1115 North Hermitage Avenue, change request C12 neighborhood commercial district to a B23 neighborhood mixed-use district. Councilor?

[Speaker 29] (4:00:21 - 4:01:09)
Thank you. Thank you. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Sarah Barnes and I'm an attorney with the lobsters of Sam Bank. I'm happy to be here this afternoon on behalf of the applicant Welly Partners LLC. Here with me today on behalf of the applicant is Marlon Hobbs who is the property owner and also resides at the property.

Before I begin, Mr. Chairman, I would like to note before the record that this was filed as a type one zoning change application. Since the time of filing, we have been working with Alderman LaSpada as well as the local community towards some changes on the proposal. And as a result of the same, we do have a substitute narrative as well as a substitute set of plans that I would ask be incorporated into the record here today.

[Speaker 1] (4:01:09 - 4:01:22)
So Alderman Beal moves to accept the substantive narrative and plans for this type one application. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Hearing none. Substantive narrative and plans are before us.

[Speaker 29] (4:01:22 - 4:03:30)
Thank you so much. We actually began this process well over a year ago with the predecessor Alderman as well as the East Village Neighborhood Association. Over the last several months, the programming for the proposal has taken quite a few turns and made a lot of changes in light of the feedback that we received not only from the East Village Association but also the neighbors and residents of the area.

As a result, I think we have a proposal before the committee here today that is well embraced by the local community. Towards that end, Alderman LaSpada recently stepped in and with a very community-driven process helped us get this over the goal line. So we're very thankful to him for that.

Towards this end, the applicant is seeking a zoning change in order to permit the rehabilitation and repurposing of the existing four-story mixed-use building at the subject site. The existing building presently contains one commercial unit at grade level and three dwelling units above, one each on the second through fourth floor. The existing commercial tenant is not the most desirable for this neighborhood in particular because this is a mostly residential neighborhood.

As a result, the proposal calls for the conversion of the existing grade-level commercial unit into two dwelling units. The three dwelling units between the second and fourth floors will remain unchanged. To accommodate for each of the proposed dwelling units, there will now be a total of five at the site.

There will be off-street parking for five vehicles located in the attached, the existing attached garage. As I mentioned, we have been working with Alderman LaSpada as well as the local neighborhood group and the residents of the neighborhood. And we do believe that we have the support of all those interested parties here today.

But Alderman LaSpada could probably speak further to that effect. And we just very respectfully request the support of this committee.

[Speaker 1] (4:03:32 - 4:03:34)
Okay, Alderman LaSpada.

[Speaker 12] (4:03:36 - 4:04:11)
Thank you, Chairman. Yes, I want to really commend Sarah and Marlon on their patience and their persistence and their willingness to work with us through a truly, at times, difficult, but a genuinely community-driven process. I feel like the development that I'm supporting here today that they've been willing to really go through an iterative process on is very reflective of the community, not only aesthetically and its zoning, but also the values in terms of what we want to see on the street.

It's a great project and I'm happy to support it.

[Speaker 1] (4:04:15 - 4:04:16)
Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 12] (4:04:16 - 4:04:18)
Questions for the Alderman or the applicants?

[Speaker 1] (4:04:20 - 4:05:16)
Hearing none, I ask Alderman Lopez to pass with substitute narrative and plans. All those in favor? Any opposed?

Opinion chairs, the ayes have it. Passed with substitute narrative and plans. Thank you.

Now we're going to stay with the first board, I think. Bottom of page 23. Okay, this item is number 20076-T1 in the first ward.

Ordinance referred on July 24th of 19. Common address, 1248 North Palina Street. Change request, B3-2 Community Shopping District to a B2-3 Neighborhood Mixed-Use District.

[Speaker 9] (4:05:17 - 4:06:38)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Tyler Manick of the Shane Banks Law Firm. With me is John McCormick, James Clough, the applicant and owner of 1248 North Palina, and his architect, Mr. Joyce, who designed the plans that are subject to this Type 1 zoning amendment. The applicant has resided at the premises for a number of years. The property is currently used as a three-dwelling unit building. In the course of preparing to renovate his home for expanded plans for their family, they discovered that the city is only recognizing two dwelling units with that third unit as a commercial unit.

The applicant, therefore, is requesting a zoning amendment from a B3-2 Community Shopping District to a B2-3 Neighborhood Mixed-Use District in order to legalize the third dwelling unit so that the homeowner's plans can move forward. The property is a transit-served location as well. The applicant has discussed those plans with the Alderman's office and presented these plans to the Worker Park Neighbors Committee who overwhelmingly supported this project, and I believe the Alderman is here to confirm and voice his support for this project, and we'd be happy to answer any questions afterwards.

[Speaker 1] (4:06:40 - 4:06:42)
Thank you, Councilor. Alderman LaSvada.

[Speaker 12] (4:06:43 - 4:07:04)
Very much, Chairman. Yes, very grateful to have worked with the developer and with the Worker Park Committee on this. It's definitely a rational choice, very much in line with the zoning along Paulina in this stretch.

Working off of the support from Worker Park Committee, I'm glad to support this proposal. Great.

[Speaker 1] (4:07:04 - 4:07:57)
Questions for Alderman LaSvada or the applicant? Hearing none, I have a motion. Move to pass by Alderman Beall.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

Opinion chair, the ayes have it. Item is passed. Do we have anything else in number one?

Alderman, you've been very busy. All right, let's move to the top of page 24, that item being number 20081T1 in the first ward ordinance referred July 24th of 19, common address 2209 North Campbell Avenue. Change request, RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RM5.5 residential multi-unit district. Councillor?

[Speaker 6] (4:07:58 - 4:09:32)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name for the record is Thomas S. Moore and with me today is Mr. Kyle Glasscott who is a representative of the owner. This is one of those situations where there's a longtime existing six flat which is non-conforming in an R3 zone and there's a parent vacant lot next to it which could nicely hold a single family home. The purpose of this zoning change is to make the six flat compliant and so that after going to the zoning board, we would be able to split the lot and have a single family on the next door lot. We went through a long, about a year now, community process and the community had a lot of input which Mr. Glasscott has accepted and embraced and we got caught in the switch of aldermen but Alderman LaSpada very graciously even before he was inaugurated walked the property with Mr. Glasscott and we believe he's here to support this request and we'd ask for your support as well. I should also say Mr. Glasscott has, although it doesn't come under the ordinance, he has agreed to make one of the larger family units in the sixth flat a portable unit.

[Speaker 1] (4:09:36 - 4:09:39)
Okay, can we hear from Alderman LaSpada?

[Speaker 12] (4:09:41 - 4:10:20)
Thank you again. Yes, I mean it was very convenient for me to walk the property with Mr. Glasscott since I live about 200 feet away from it. It's 2040 North Campbell.

It's a great development. I really appreciate you taking in the feedback, earning the support of the Greater Daphne Neighborhood Association. Plus working with us to keep one of the three bedrooms affordable is doubly commendable as we work to really maintain the student population at our local schools and make sure we have as much affordability in that part of the neighborhood as possible.

Thank you so much for coming to us today and I'm proud to support this project.

[Speaker 1] (4:10:23 - 4:11:17)
Questions for the aldermen? Hearing none, do I have a motion? Move to pass on this item.

So moved by Alderman Lopez. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Continue to share the ayes have it. Item's passed.

All right. Yeah, yeah. All right.

Bottom of page 24. Item number 20122-T1 in the first ward. Ordinance referred on July 24th of 19.

Common address, 1838 West Grand Avenue. Change request M12 Limited Manufacturing Business Park District to a B13 Neighborhood Shopping District.

[Speaker 13] (4:11:19 - 4:11:39)
Afternoon, Mr. Chairman. Danny Lauer, LAUER on behalf of Dan Kravitz, K-R-A-V-I-T-Z who's here today. This is 1838 West Grand 20122-Type 1.

There is a substitute narrative in plans. Department?

[Speaker 1] (4:11:40 - 4:11:56)
Okay. So I'm going to ask Alderman Lopez move to accept the substitute narrative in plans. Alderman Lopez, so moved.

Okay. All those in favor? Aye.

The substitute is in front of us. Thanks.

[Speaker 13] (4:11:56 - 4:13:01)
As I said, I represent Mr. Kravitz. Mr. Kravitz owns several businesses in Westtown, including Dark Matter Coffee and is a property owner, a busy property owner in Westtown. This property is a part of Westtown that was old manufacturing zoning.

So the proposal today is M12 to B13. This is just a beautiful limestone building with detailed stone features on it. It was built in 1892.

There'll be no change as to the building except Mr. Kravitz will now be able to resuscitate the building, rehab the residential units up above. He's in negotiations with a tenant who would assemble specialty products in the north part of the building that runs to the alley. And then they would have a retail store in the front.

We met with the Chicago Grand Neighbors and obtained their support. And I've met with Alderman LaSpada's Chief of Staff, Mr. Nicholas Zatel. And we're very happy to have their support to revitalize this building.

Great. Alderman LaSpada.

[Speaker 12] (4:13:02 - 4:13:46)
Thank you very much, Chair. Yes, I mean, it's fortuitous that we should be coming off of the heels of approving the Kinsey Framework Plan today because this is exactly the type of development you would hope to see adjacent to that. Retail, appropriate retail on Grand Avenue.

Also kind of supporting that quasi-21st century manufacturing mode with the chocolatier that's moving in. I think you buried the lead on the chocolatier there. But being able to bring these older buildings into productive use is what I'm hoping to see, what Chicago Grand Neighborhood Association is excited to see.

And so for those reasons, I'm very glad to support the project today. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (4:13:46 - 4:14:14)
Thank you, Alderman. Questions for Alderman LaSpada or the applicant? Hearing none, Alderman Hopkins moves to pass.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

The opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it. And this will be passed with substitute narrative and plan. Great.

Should have brought some coffee for this little meeting here. Of course, we can't ask that anymore. Okay, next.

[Speaker 62] (4:14:14 - 4:14:15)
Bottom of page 14.

[Speaker 1] (4:14:16 - 4:14:41)
Bottom of page 14, application number 20127, 26th Ward, ordinance referred on July 24th of 19, common address 2738 West Chicago Avenue, change request C12 Neighborhood Commercial District to a B23 Neighborhood Mixed Use District. Councilor?

[Speaker 5] (4:14:41 - 4:15:39)
Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, my name is Mark Kupiec. I'm an attorney with the offices of 77 West Washington. I represent the applicant.

And I have with me today here, Roman Popovich Senior and Roman Popovich Junior. And the purpose of the zoning change to convert the existing commercial unit in the existing building into an additional dwelling unit for a total of four dwelling units. The situation that we're faced here is that the block that the property is located on, the large majority of buildings are residential.

The next block is residential. Across the street is a large storage warehouse. So the bottom line, this turns out to be a bad location for a commercial unit on the ground floor, whereas there'd be a great demand for a residential unit, which they'd be able to do with this zoning change.

Roman has spoken with Alderman Maldonado on numerous occasions to explain the situation, explain the proposed change, and to ask for his support. And I do believe he sent you a letter.

[Speaker 1] (4:15:40 - 4:16:08)
Yes, we do have a letter from Alderman Maldonado. Questions? Motion moved to pass by Alderman Dowell.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

Convener and Chair, the ayes have it. And this item is passed. Thank you.

Thank you, Mark. 15. Okay.

Staying in the 26th Ward.

[Speaker 56] (4:16:14 - 4:16:15)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (4:16:15 - 4:16:47)
So on the top of page 15, document number 20126, 26th Ward, ordinance referred July 24th of 19, common address 2725 West Potomac. Change request, RS3, residential single unit detached house to an RM4.5 residential multi-unit district. Sir, could you identify yourself for the record?

[Speaker 45] (4:16:48 - 4:16:56)
Mr. Chairman, honorable members of the committee, this is T20126. Good afternoon. My name is Jason Williams.

[Speaker 1] (4:16:57 - 4:16:58)
Jason Williams?

[Speaker 45] (4:16:58 - 4:17:31)
Correct. Okay. And I represent myself and my company, Dubs Enterprises, LLC.

We are the owners of the common address, 2725 West Potomac Avenue, which is located in the East Humboldt Park neighborhood. Today's application is a request to amend the current zoning to RM4.5 residential multi-unit district. From its current designation of RS3, single unit detached house district.

We are proposing to demolish an existing building and construct a new three-story, three-dwelling unit with a basement.

[Speaker 1] (4:17:32 - 4:17:52)
There will not be any commercial units in this new building, and we are proposing three onsite parking space. Okay. So, Mr. Williams, have you, your alderman is Alderman Maldonado?

Correct. Have you met with Alderman Maldonado? Correct.

Yes. And what is, we do not have a letter of support from Alderman Maldonado.

[Speaker 45] (4:17:52 - 4:17:56)
I have it with me, and I can introduce it. Just in case I brought it.

[Speaker 64] (4:18:08 - 4:18:08)
Okay.

[Speaker 55] (4:18:11 - 4:18:12)
Okay.

[Speaker 25] (4:18:14 - 4:18:22)
All right.

[Speaker 45] (4:18:23 - 4:18:23)
Should I continue?

[Speaker 1] (4:18:24 - 4:18:28)
Are you finished with your presentation? No, no, no, I'd like to continue.

[Speaker 45] (4:18:28 - 4:18:49)
Okay. So we're proposing to demolish an existing building and construct a new three-story and three-dwelling unit with a basement. There will not be any commercial units in this building, and we are proposing three onsite parking spaces.

The building height will be 49 1⁄2 feet tall. All right. I got, I have a little more.

[Speaker 1] (4:18:50 - 4:18:51)
Carry on.

[Speaker 45] (4:18:51 - 4:19:56)
Okay, no problem. Before starting this process, I met with the Grassroots Illinois Alliance Neighborhood Association and received their approval on this project. The GIA held a community meeting of which I was a part of.

I was able to get the support of the residents at this meeting. With me, I have a copy of that letter, but I think you don't need it, which will show their support. And if needed, I can submit that letter now.

Separately, I did meet with Mr. Alderman Maldonado's office of our city's signed Progressive 26 Ward. The Alderman's office has been extremely supportive of my efforts, and I believe the Alderman's Chief of Staff, Kathleen Ascandy, as well as Alderman Maldonado, would confirm their support of this application today. With me, I have the letter, which I've already submitted.

I'm here today to ask for your support as well, Chairman. At this time, if I may, I'd also, before I end, I'd like to give a warm thank you to Ms. Anna Robles from the Zoning Office who helped me prepare this application. She worked very hard in her professionalism during my application process, should be mentioned here today.

I can answer any questions you may have at this time.

[Speaker 1] (4:19:57 - 4:20:15)
Okay, so we do have a letter of support from Alderman Maldonado. Um, that was as early as May 6th? Yes.

Okay. Um, Anna, or the department, any issues with... No?

Great.

[Speaker 10] (4:20:16 - 4:20:34)
Okay. Thank you. Yes, Alderman Beal.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just for housekeeping, do you have, um, verification that all the mailings went out to everybody within the 200-foot radius? Can you provide that?

I don't have it with me, but I can get that. Okay, can you provide that before... I mean, we're both...

[Speaker 1] (4:20:34 - 4:20:36)
What about Anna? Does the department have...

[Speaker 10] (4:20:38 - 4:20:39)
We've got the mailing list, but I need...

[Speaker 58] (4:20:39 - 4:21:03)
And they sent them out too, yeah. Yeah, everybody's been notified, and all the neighbors know and everything. Alderman Steve Valenziano, Department of Planning.

We do not send the notice out. We receive a copy of the list of property owners that it was sent to. We have a map of where it was sent to, and an affidavit from the applicant stating that they have sent it out in accordance with the ordinance, and that's as much as we have.

[Speaker 10] (4:21:04 - 4:21:14)
Okay, well, just before this is reported out, if you can provide some type of proof that everybody within the 250-foot radius was notified.

[Speaker 1] (4:21:14 - 4:21:39)
No problem. Great. All right, any other questions?

With hearing none, I motion by Alderman Lopez to move do pass on this item. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? The union chair, the ayes have it, and this item is passed.

[Speaker 45] (4:21:39 - 4:21:40)
Thank you very much. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (4:21:42 - 4:22:10)
Next, on item number 20067, 26th Ward, ordinance referred on July 24th of 19, common address 3511 West Dickens Avenue, change request. RS3 residential single unit detached house to an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district.

[Speaker 9] (4:22:12 - 4:23:04)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Tyler Manick of the Shane Banks Law Firm. I'm here with the applicant, Brandon Lieberthal, who owns 3511 West Dickens as subject property.

The building is an existing three-flat, however, the city is only recognizing two of the units there. Mr. Lieberthal lives in one of the units and would like to rezone this property to an RT4 so that the city will recognize his three units and allow him to refinance out of his current loan and offset the cost of home ownership while he lives in the third unit. No changes are being proposed to the existing building.

Mr. Lieberthal and I did meet with Alderman Maldonado about this request, and Alderman Maldonado was kind enough to give us a letter of support, which I do believe you have in your file.

[Speaker 1] (4:23:05 - 4:23:07)
We do, we do have a letter of request.

[Speaker 9] (4:23:08 - 4:23:20)
So with the support of Alderman Maldonado, we respectfully request your favorable recommendation on this. It does. Okay.

And we also would like to incorporate a substitute ordinance.

[Speaker 1] (4:23:21 - 4:23:53)
Okay, so Alderman Beal moves to accept the substitute ordinance. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Ayes have it, and the substitute is accepted. Now, on the motion or questions for the applicant, we do have a letter of support from Alderman Maldonado.

Questions, if not? Alderman Hopkins moves to pass on this item. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? Opinion of the chair, the ayes have it, and item is passed.

[Speaker 31] (4:23:53 - 4:23:54)
Thank you. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (4:23:54 - 4:24:36)
All right, we would, pardon me? Okie doke, middle of page 16, item number 20077. In the 17th ward, ordinance referred July 24th of 19.

Address 2606 West 69th Street. This is the Lithuanian Plaza Court. Change request, a B-1-2 neighborhood shopping district to a B-2-2 neighborhood mixed-use district.

[Speaker 27] (4:24:40 - 4:24:41)
We're back?

[Speaker 9] (4:24:41 - 4:25:46)
Yeah. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. For the record, once again, my name is Tyler Manick of the Shane Banks Law Firm.

I'm here on behalf of the applicant, Landshark Ventures, owner of the building at 2606 West 69th Street. I'm here with Michael King, a principal of the applicant. The subject property of 2606 West 69th Street has a two-story existing building with commercial ground floor space and residential unit above.

The applicant seeks a zoning amendment from a B-1-2 neighborhood shopping district to a B-2-2 neighborhood mixed-use district to allow the applicant to renovate the existing building. After renovations, existing building will have a dwelling unit on the ground floor and another dwelling unit on the second floor for a total of two dwelling units. There will be no commercial space provided and the size of the existing building will remain the same.

Prior to filing this application, the applicant has met with the alderman and discussed this project with various community members. The alderman has kindly given us a letter of support and we'd be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (4:25:50 - 4:26:16)
Great. I know Alderman Moore was here, but we do have a letter of support. Okay.

Questions for the applicant? Hearing none, Alderman Dowell moves due pass on this item. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? Opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it and this item is passed.

[Speaker 9] (4:26:16 - 4:26:17)

Okay. We're going to hear the next five applications together.

[Speaker 65] (4:26:29 - 4:26:29)

Okay.

[Speaker 1] (4:27:50 - 4:29:12)
Next, item number 20109, 16th Ward, ordinance referred to on July 24th of 19. Common address, 6031 South Green Street. Change request, RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RT4 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district.

Next item is 20110. Again, in the 16th Ward, ordinance referred on July 24th of 19. Common address, 6035 through 6039 South Green Street.

Residential, or change request, residential, RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RT4 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district. And then the last of these items is document number 20111. Again, in the 16th Ward, ordinance referred on July 24th of 19.

Common address, 6101 South Sangamon Street. Change request, RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RT4 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district. And I believe that concludes these applications.

All right. So, counselor, let's start.

[Speaker 7] (4:29:12 - 4:29:56)
Thank you. Tell us what we're doing on. Thank you.

My name is Steve Friedland. I'm an attorney with Applegate and Thornton Thompson in Chicago. Here on behalf of the Hope Manor Village Housing Limited Partnership, which is wholly run by Volunteers of America of Illinois.

Let me first introduce our team, and I'll tell you what we're doing. So I have with me Nancy Hughes, who's the president and CEO of Volunteers of America of Illinois. To her right is Kevin Freeman, who is the director of community development for Volunteers of America.

And our architect, Mike Jarabeck, is here as well. This is a project that has been around for a while, though not as long as this meeting, Mr. Chairman. Only about three years.

[Speaker 17] (4:29:56 - 4:29:57)
We're not done yet, so. Okay.

[Speaker 7] (4:29:59 - 4:33:08)
And this is a second phase of a development that Volunteers of America did a planned development in this neighborhood a few years ago. This project is a scattered site affordable housing development. There are 16 separate scattered sites, and in total there will be 36 dwelling units developed, all affordable.

All of the land is owned by the city of Chicago, so this is a development we've been doing with the city for some time. The five sites that are before you all need to be rezoned in order to allow the development type that we're proposing. They all are rezoning from the RS-3 to the RT-4.

Of the sites before you, four of them are going to be three flats, and one is going to be a two flat. The two flat is the site at 59-58 South Green. It needs to be rezoned from the RS-3 to the RT-4 because it is a substandard lot.

In order to get two units on that, we needed to go to the RT-4. All of the other four sites are rezoning from RS-3 to RT-4 to allow for the three units. We are requesting that there be three substitute ordinances because all of this property is vacant that we're about to build on.

We guessed at addresses because obviously there's no buildings. When we went in for building permit, the three parcels that are on Green Street, which on your agenda are 6031 South Green, 6033 South Green, and 6035-39 South Green, those three, we got slightly different addresses from CDOT. For 6031 South Green, we were given 6033, which is what our substitute request is for.

There's nothing changing other than the address. For 6033 South Green, we were given 6035 South Green, and for the 6035-39, we were given 6037. What was 6035-39?

We were given 6037, just one address. We just thought it would be easier to clear that up so that the ordinances as published match what will be the addresses. We've provided you with three substitutes and would request that you accept those substitutes.

For 201-07, and for 201-09, and for 201-10.

[Speaker 51] (4:33:12 - 4:33:17)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (4:33:19 - 4:33:38)
Okay, so Alderman Dowell moves to accept the substituted ordinance for- For files 201-07, 201-09, and 201-10.

[Speaker 7] (4:33:39 - 4:33:43)
Is that correct? Yes, I'm sorry.

[Speaker 1] (4:33:43 - 4:33:44)
Yes, that is correct.

[Speaker 7] (4:33:44 - 4:33:47)
I'll make sure that we get that correct. That is correct.

[Speaker 1] (4:33:47 - 4:33:57)
All right, so Alderman Dowell moves those substitutes. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Okay, so now we have those substitutes in front of us.

[Speaker 7] (4:33:57 - 4:34:45)
Excellent. So, again, the purpose of this is to allow for those five sites to be rezoned to permit the housing to go on there. As I've stated, and what you have before you, in front of you, and we had it on the screen a moment ago, the first drawing was of all of the scattered site developments that are part of what?

In purple. Yes, thank you. So everything that you see on the screen above is part of the Hope Manor Village development.

Everything that is circled or drawn around in black are the five parcels that we are requesting rezoning for, and we certainly would be willing to take any questions that you might have.

[Speaker 1] (4:34:49 - 4:34:54)
Ambitious project. Alderman Coleman was here.

[Speaker 7] (4:34:54 - 4:34:59)
Alderman Coleman was here and spoke with us that she was in support.

[Speaker 1] (4:35:02 - 4:35:25)
Well, we will take that into consideration and pass it, but we have to get written support, right? Okay. All right, so before I end, I have some questions and maybe just a question or two.

So this is 100% affordable housing?

[Speaker 18] (4:35:31 - 4:36:00)
Yes, this is 100% supportive affordable housing targeted to veterans, although not exclusively to veteran-headed households. All two bedrooms, so all family housing and all an extension of our Hope Manor 2 campus that exists right there beginning at 60th and Halsted and extending into 60th and Green Street. These are all scattered sites sort of in concentric circles around our Hope Manor 2 campus so that those households will also have the benefit of the intensive services and supports available at Hope Manor 2.

[Speaker 1] (4:36:01 - 4:36:12)
So it's veteran housing and access living type of units? Or I'm sorry, you said veteran housing.

[Speaker 18] (4:36:12 - 4:36:25)
So it's targeted to veterans, but it's not exclusive to veterans. So there's 36 units in total, all two bedrooms. Our Hope Manor 2 campus is specific to veterans.

This will be targeted to veterans, but is not exclusive to veterans.

[Speaker 1] (4:36:30 - 4:36:37)
Was there any indication of doing some market rate at all in it? Or you don't mix it up?

[Speaker 18] (4:36:37 - 4:37:21)
This was part of a larger community plan. Hope Manor Village is part of a larger community plan to promote home ownership, bring more affordable rental housing, and to promote more community amenities amongst all the vacant lots. The goal of our larger community initiative here was to reduce the number of vacant lots in the city.

I'm sorry, specifically in the neighborhood of Inglewood, which has the highest concentration of vacant lots in the city. And so in terms of the vacant lots, that was targeted for promoting more affordable rental housing. We're partnering with Neighborhood Housing Services to try and rehab a lot of the abandoned homes to promote more home ownership, which will obviously be more of a market rate component.

And then obviously, we're trying to do some commercial development along Halstead that will bring more community amenities that will support both of those things.

[Speaker 1] (4:37:23 - 4:37:24)
Yep, Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 2] (4:37:27 - 4:37:55)
Point of information and clarification. First of all, this is a great organization. They have a building in my ward, and usually I try to steal anything they're doing anywhere else and get it in my ward.

But they help a lot of veterans. But so the market over there is affordable, right? So a market rate house in that community would be affordable anyway, right?

[Speaker 34] (4:37:55 - 4:37:56)
Yes.

[Speaker 2] (4:37:56 - 4:37:57)
Because things sell for affordable.

[Speaker 34] (4:37:58 - 4:38:01)
It's all relative, right? Yeah, it's all relative. Yeah.

[Speaker 2] (4:38:02 - 4:38:07)
So really, they build them. You could say they build a market rate, but they build them affordable because the market is affordable.

[Speaker 1] (4:38:10 - 4:38:15)
Other questions? Alderman Osterman. But is it all by government funds?

[Speaker 18] (4:38:19 - 4:38:31)
Being funded through low-income housing tax credits allocated by the Illinois Housing Development Authority. There's a grant from the Federal Home Loan Bank, a grant from Home Depot Foundation, and a few other smaller sources.

[Speaker 37] (4:38:33 - 4:38:38)
The LIHTC funds, that's funds that have already been secured by the organization? Correct.

[Speaker 18] (4:38:38 - 4:38:41)
The project is fully funded, fully committed.

[Speaker 37] (4:38:46 - 4:38:57)
So it's two- and three-unit, two-story, two units in each apartment? Ballpark costs and what it would cost to build one of those.

[Speaker 18] (4:38:57 - 4:39:01)
We have four three-flats and 12 two-flat buildings.

[Speaker 37] (4:39:01 - 4:39:03)
How much are the two-flats? Just the ballpark?

[Speaker 18] (4:39:03 - 4:39:09)
I don't know off the top of my head. Yeah, I mean, our overall construction cost is about $10.5 million.

[Speaker 25] (4:39:12 - 4:39:14)
Oh, hold on. Mike, chair.

[Speaker 1] (4:39:15 - 4:39:17)
Alderman, are you, you need more information?

[Speaker 37] (4:39:18 - 4:39:19)
Offline about it. Thank you. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (4:39:19 - 4:39:32)
Good work. Okay, hold on a second. Did you want to respond at all?

You'll talk offline. Okay, great. Alderman Dowell.

[Speaker 30] (4:39:33 - 4:39:40)
And just a quick question. Is the applicant also the property manager for the development?

[Speaker 18] (4:39:41 - 4:39:52)
America, we're the developer. Why don't you identify yourself again? Nancy Hughes-Moyer.

Again, volunteers of America of Illinois. Again, because this is a mission project for us. We're the property manager, the service provider, the owner, and the developer.

[Speaker 4] (4:39:55 - 4:40:23)
Other questions? Thank you, chairman. As the alderman neighboring this area, these other locations, were these also city lots that you'd gotten?

And were these lots purchased? Or is this an agreement with the Department of Planning and Development for this project?

[Speaker 18] (4:40:24 - 4:40:26)
Speaking of the ones that are part of this project?

[Speaker 4] (4:40:26 - 4:40:29)
All of them. All of your purple sections?

[Speaker 18] (4:40:30 - 4:40:31)
They're all city-owned lots.

[Speaker 4] (4:40:31 - 4:40:36)
So the city owns the lot currently? Correct. With your building on it?

[Speaker 18] (4:40:37 - 4:40:39)
No, there are no buildings on these. These will be in construction.

[Speaker 4] (4:40:39 - 4:40:42)
What about the other ones? So are you...

[Speaker 7] (4:40:44 - 4:40:47)
Lots to the developer.

[Speaker 4] (4:40:47 - 4:40:48)
At no cost?

[Speaker 7] (4:40:51 - 4:40:54)
A dollar, yeah. Yes, a nominal cost.

[Speaker 4] (4:40:55 - 4:40:57)
And is that the same for the other lots as well?

[Speaker 7] (4:40:57 - 4:40:58)
Correct.

[Speaker 4] (4:40:59 - 4:41:10)
Okay. And when did those other eight or so developments... When were those built as part of this campus?

[Speaker 18] (4:41:10 - 4:41:24)
Hope Meter 2 is 73 units. We have a main building at 60th and Halstead. We have five four-bedroom townhomes.

And then we have the series of six flats on Green Street. Those were all built at the same time. And we opened around the spring of 2014.

[Speaker 4] (4:41:26 - 4:41:31)
So, okay. And that was under... With Alderman Joanne Thompson, I believe, at the time.

[Speaker 18] (4:41:31 - 4:41:31)
Correct.

[Speaker 4] (4:41:33 - 4:41:40)
And how much farther are you planning on pursuing these scattered site developments in the greater Englewood area?

[Speaker 18] (4:41:41 - 4:42:05)
So at this point, we're focused on those 16 parcels. And then what we're trying to do on Halstead in terms of bringing some more community amenities. The combination of homeownership, the more affordable rental, and greater community amenities.

That would keep and attract families. And Englewood was the sort of overall project. So those are the three initiatives in that immediate area that we're really prioritizing.

[Speaker 4] (4:42:05 - 4:43:04)
I heard you say that. But I'm just asking because I've seen over the years, in the almost decade I've been involved in that neighborhood, people who've come in building things. I think I still have a sign from the Neighborhood Stabilization Fund where they were building something affordable at $275,000 in West Englewood.

I'm always a little leery when I start hearing people saying, we're going to take over the lots. We're going to start building things. We're going to start doing things.

And we're not exactly certain how that's going to proceed moving forward. And I do think that, at least in my end, once you cross Ashland, as we're looking at our lots, if this were to even come my direction, I want to make sure that there was more of a coordinated effort to try and centralize this campus, as opposed to having a scattered site campus that spans five blocks in all different directions, in my opinion.

[Speaker 18] (4:43:05 - 4:43:22)
The campus is concentrated right there, essentially, on that corner and behind it. The scattered site was, again, to try and do as much as we could with the volume of vacant lots that were surrounding it. So the campus itself, Hotelino 2, is concentrated and pretty contiguous.

[Speaker 4] (4:43:22 - 4:43:34)
So when you came up with this plan, when was this design and all of that crafted? For what you're here for today, for these five items.

[Speaker 18] (4:43:35 - 4:43:58)
Around 2016 was when we first, we utilized a human-centered design process. We partnered with Greater Good Studio to work with the community to sort of develop a plan, with the problem being all these vacant lots. That was in the quality of life plan for Teamwork Inglewood, which is identified as one of the biggest challenges facing the community.

I'm aware of that plan, yes. So we convened stakeholders and focus groups around beginning in 2016.

[Speaker 4] (4:43:58 - 4:44:03)
So for this plan was in 2016. For these five houses was in 2016.

[Speaker 18] (4:44:03 - 4:44:10)
It's a total of 16. We only need zoning changes on five. So that whole plan began in 2016.

[Speaker 4] (4:44:11 - 4:44:52)
The reason I'm asking is because, obviously, vacant lots in Greater Inglewood are a concern of mine. As I introduced in city council last month, wanting to give back the authority to sell them to the local aldermen, particularly because in my own ward, I'm very much concerned about outside groups manipulating the dollar lot program to take over my communities. I wanted to make sure that in 2016, when the administration was different and the alderman was different, was alderman Folks at that time involved and aware that this was going on with the vacant lots in her ward?

[Speaker 18] (4:44:53 - 4:44:55)
Alderman Folks was actually on our task force.

[Speaker 4] (4:44:55 - 4:44:57)
I'm not asking about the task force.

[Speaker 18] (4:44:57 - 4:44:59)
And she was very supportive.

[Speaker 4] (4:44:59 - 4:45:45)
I just have to answer the question. Was she supportive of giving, conveying the vacant lots in this matter? Thank you.

I'm not worried about the task force. I'm not worried about Teamwork Inglewood and the quality of life plan because it's no different than the one that they made 20 years ago that has about an inch of dust on it. The lots are still there.

The housing needs are still there. My concern are that people are doing things with our lots at a time when space is coming to a premium in the city of Chicago. So I wanted to ensure that alderman Folks was actually part and parcel to this process of selling the lots.

And that it's not just alderman Coleman now who's just saying yes, because it's good. But that there was some thought and consideration.

[Speaker 1] (4:45:47 - 4:47:02)
Thank you, Chairman. Great. Okay.

Other questions? Ambitious projects. Obviously applaud all you're doing and making sure that we can keep our neighborhoods moving in the right direction in a strong way.

We've got a little, we're going to go through this, the substituted ones first I'm going to ask. And then we'll get the ones that do not need a substitute. So we're hearing a motion on these three of these items.

That's applications number 20107, 20109, 20110 to pass as amended. All those in favor? Any opposed?

Opinion of the chair. These items are passed as amended. Now we'll go to ones, the remaining two, those items, application number 20108 and 20111.

A motion to move these items by alderman Beal. All those in favor? Any opposed?

Opinion of the chair. These items are passed. So we've got all five passed for the council meeting.

Thank you.

[Speaker 18] (4:47:02 - 4:47:03)
Thank you all very much.

[Speaker 1] (4:47:07 - 4:47:29)
Middle of page 18. Document number 20097 in the 12th ward. Ordinance referred on July 24th of 19.

Common address 2434 South Albany Avenue. Change request RT4 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district to an RM 4.5 residential multi-unit district.

[Speaker 43] (4:47:31 - 4:48:17)
Counselor. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant. Here with me today is Mark McCullough from the applicant.

The proposal is really relatively straightforward. This is a two-story building that over the years has officially only has one unit, but over the years, it's had anywhere from three to four units in the building. It has been the subject of many city building code violations.

This is all occurring before my client took ownership and has been vacant and boarded for a while. My client has purchased the property, wishes to rehabilitate the property. It's about a 5,000 square foot building that they'd like to add, put five units in, this time legally, have that done with three parking spaces in the rear.

We have met with the local alderman and I believe he has submitted a letter of support for this matter.

[Speaker 1] (4:48:20 - 4:48:30)
All right, we have a letter of support from Alderman Cardenas. Questions for the attorney? Hearing none, I just have a simple question.

What's the size of the lot?

[Speaker 43] (4:48:30 - 4:48:31)
3,000 square feet.

[Speaker 1] (4:48:32 - 4:48:33)
With how big a building on it?

[Speaker 43] (4:48:33 - 4:48:37)
5,000 and it's partial two-story, partial one-story, kind of a strange building.

[Speaker 1] (4:48:37 - 4:50:07)
All right, any other questions? If not, Alderman Osterman moves do pass as amended. No, I'm sorry.

Alderman Osterman moves do pass. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Committee Chair, the ayes have it and thank you very much for your patience and good luck to you. All right, thank you.

So now we're on the bottom of page 18, document number 201-02, 12th Ward, ordinance referred on July 24th of 19, common address, 2900-02 West Pershing Road. This item is being deferred at the request of Alderman Cardenas and I have a motion to defer this item. Alderman Osterman moves to defer.

All those in favor? Any opposed? This item is deferred.

All right, top of page 19, document number 20098-T1 in the 12th Ward, ordinance referred on July 24th of 19, common address, 2454 South Spaulding Avenue and the change request here is a B31, from B31 Community Shopping District to a B23 Neighborhood Mixed Use District.

[Speaker 65] (4:50:09 - 4:50:10)
Rolando, carry on.

[Speaker 43] (4:50:10 - 4:50:41)
Good afternoon again, Mr. Chairman. Rolando Acosta here again with Mark McCullough on behalf of the applicant. This is a similar story.

This is another vacant building that's been vacant for many years subject to multiple building code violations. It's been boarded and secured once my client acquired it. It is an approximately 4,000 square foot building on a 3,000 square foot lot seeking to have four units in the building with two parking spaces to the rear.

For that purpose, we are seeking to resign. And I believe again, Mr. Alderman Cardenas.

[Speaker 1] (4:50:41 - 4:50:56)
We do have a letter from Alderman Cardenas. Questions by committee members? Hearing none, Alderman Beal moves to pass.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

Opinion and Chair, the ayes have it and this item is passed.

[Speaker 43] (4:50:57 - 4:50:57)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (4:50:58 - 4:51:57)
Thank you. Good luck in the 12th Ward, especially bringing back these buildings. All right.

Bottom of page 19, item number 20124-T1 in the 11th Ward. The ordinance is referred on July 24th of 19, common address 1003 through 05 West 31st Street. Change of request, RS1 single residential single unit detached house district to a B22 neighborhood mixed use district.

All right. So, good afternoon. Ready to start?

[Speaker 54] (4:51:59 - 4:53:31)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Sylvia Mikes. I'm an attorney with the law firm Taft Stettinius and Hollister located at 111 East Walker Drive.

I'm here today on behalf of the applicants Jerong Kevin Zhang and Fengming Mei. Kevin is with me this afternoon. The applicants own the property located at 1003 through 05 West 31st Street, which consists of approximately 5,800 square feet.

And the subject property is currently vacant and unimproved. The applicants are seeking to develop the subject property with a three-story mixed use building, which will be of masonry and glass construction. The proposed building will contain two commercial spaces at grade and four dwelling units above with two units on each floor.

The proposed building will have an overall height of about 48 feet. The proposed development will also include five on-site parking spaces in the rear of the property, which will be accessed up the alley. In order to permit the proposed development, the applicant is seeking to amend the property's existing RS1 zoning to a B22 zoning district.

We have worked with Alderman Thompson and a community meeting was held on July the 2nd of which the project was approved. I would like to tender the Alderman's letter of support to the committee at this time. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (4:53:32 - 4:53:38)
Great. Questions by committee members? Alderman Beal.

[Speaker 10] (4:53:41 - 4:53:47)
I'm just looking. We have quite a bit of glass in the front and the back and the side is very little. Why is that?

[Speaker 54] (4:53:48 - 4:53:48)
I'm sorry.

[Speaker 65] (4:53:49 - 4:53:50)
Why is there very...

[Speaker 1] (4:53:50 - 4:53:58)
More of a design question on the architecture now that we have all the renderings here. A lot of glass front and rear and the sides maybe.

[Speaker 10] (4:53:58 - 4:54:01)
Yeah, I mean it's very little windows on the side. Is there a reason for that?

[Speaker 1] (4:54:06 - 4:54:08)
Why don't you repeat your... Say your name.

[Speaker 25] (4:54:09 - 4:54:34)
Yeah. I'm the owner, Jerome Zhang. So I was working with the architect and we kind of wanted like an open floor plan space.

And then the reason there's little window on the sides so that they can put like furniture on both sides, one for the TV, one for the furniture, so that all the light will be coming from the street, from the front. Front and rear?

[Speaker 60] (4:54:35 - 4:54:35)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (4:54:39 - 4:55:27)
Any other questions? If not, I have a motion from Alderman Osterman. Move do pass on this item.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

Continue to share the ayes have it. Good luck. All right.

Where are we at now? Top of page 20. Let me see.

Document number 201-03, 11th Ward. Ordinance referred on July 24th of 19. Change of request, RS3, residential single unit detached house district to a C11 neighborhood commercial district.

Good afternoon.

[Speaker 64] (4:55:28 - 4:56:00)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Olivia Chang and I represent YMC Corporation, the applicant. I'm here today.

They are seeking the zoning amendment to legalize their existing use of manufacturing noodles and flour per product. No changes to the height or floor area are proposed. We've already met with the alderman and the alderman, I believe, has already sent a letter of support in advance.

[Speaker 1] (4:56:00 - 4:56:01)
We have received that.

[Speaker 64] (4:56:02 - 4:56:12)
I would also like to present and substitute an ordinance. I believe the original one has a minor title.

[Speaker 1] (4:56:15 - 4:56:18)
Have you submitted it to the department?

[Speaker 64] (4:56:18 - 4:56:21)
No, I have not. It's just an addition.

[Speaker 1] (4:56:21 - 4:56:31)
Well, wait, wait. Before we get... You want to take a look and see how minor it is?

Here. Why don't we get that?

[Speaker 64] (4:56:38 - 4:56:44)
It was just instead... I think the original one has a C-1. Just add it back to one, C-1-1.

[Speaker 32] (4:56:46 - 4:56:48)
She just has C-1-1.

[Speaker 64] (4:56:52 - 4:56:52)
That's not...

[Speaker 32] (4:56:53 - 4:57:12)
Ms. Robles. Do we need to substitute it?

[Speaker 65] (4:57:12 - 4:57:13)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (4:57:25 - 4:57:40)
Okay. So with that, Alderman Beal moves to accept the substitute ordinance. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? No.

Hearing none, the substitute is in front of us. So now we have the substitute. Is there any more?

[Speaker 64] (4:57:41 - 4:57:44)
Is there anything else you want to bring to our attention? No, thank you.

[Speaker 1] (4:57:44 - 4:58:05)
Okay. So with that, I'm going to ask for Alderman Lopez to a motion to pass as amended. Alderman, so moved.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

Opinion chair, the ayes have it. And this item is passed as amended. Thank you for coming down.

[Speaker 32] (4:58:06 - 4:58:06)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (4:58:08 - 4:58:44)
All right. Next item. Okay.

Middle of page 20 is document number 20087-T1, 11th Ward, ordinance referred on July 24th of 19. Let's see the common address 734 West 47th Street, change request B-1-1 Neighborhood Shopping District to a B-1-3 Neighborhood Shopping District. Steven?

[Speaker 7] (4:58:44 - 5:00:05)
Yes. Good afternoon. Steve Friedland with the law firm of Applegate and Thorne Thompson.

Here on behalf of the applicant, the Thresholds. The Thresholds is a not-for-profit organization that provides health care and housing to persons with mental illness and substance use disorders. This particular site is currently owned and occupied by Thresholds.

And it's a health care facility. It's a federally qualified health center. Their desire is to expand and build an addition onto the building, which is the requirement, the reason why we are requiring a rezoning from the B-1-1 to a 1-3.

I do have with me here today from Thresholds, Joanne Smith, who's the vice president of clinical operations and our architect, Gabriel Dajkowicz. Thank you. I always screw that up.

Sorry. And as I indicated, the request is to zone the property from B-1-1 to 1-3. This is a type 1 rezoning.

We did submit a substitute narrative and plan. So we would request that you accept those for the hearing.

[Speaker 1] (5:00:06 - 5:00:12)
I'm going to ask Alderman Beal to move to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type 1 application.

[Speaker 11] (5:00:13 - 5:00:14)
All those in favor?

[Speaker 1] (5:00:15 - 5:00:19)
Aye. Any opposed? The substitute narrative and plans are before us.

[Speaker 7] (5:00:19 - 5:00:45)
Thank you. We did meet with Alderman Thompson with respect to this request. And there were a couple of community meetings that he held to review this.

As I say, nothing's really changing from a use standpoint. It's just that there's going to be an expansion of the health care development on the site. With that, we would take any questions you might have.

[Speaker 1] (5:00:46 - 5:02:04)
And we have a letter of support from Alderman Thompson. Questions by committee members? I don't have a question.

I just do have a comment about the good work that Thresholds does throughout the city. So, Stephen, I didn't think you needed to define what Thresholds is, because there's so much involved with all parts of the city. So it's a great project and much needed.

Can I get a motion to pass by Alderman Osterman? Moves to pass. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? Opinion chair, the ayes have it.

Item is passed. Thank you very much. It's passed with substitute narrative and plans.

All right, now we are. Bottom of page 20. Document number 20128 in the 10th ward.

Ordinance referred July 24th of 19. Common address 8701 through 8757 South Baltimore Avenue. Change request M12 limited manufacturing business park district to an M32 heavy industry district.

Mark, you ready?

[Speaker 5] (5:02:06 - 5:02:49)
Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My name is Mark Kupiec. I'm an attorney with Office of 77 West Washington.

Represent the applicant. Have with me on behalf of the applicant, Jeffrey Lev, who's seated beside me. And one procedural matter before we get started is I did previously submit a substitute ordinance to the zoning department and hopefully a copy to your staff.

We originally put an application in asking to rezone to an M3. Further investigation revealed that the proposed use actually would be allowed in the M2 district. So the substitute would be to rezone it to an M2-2.

So if one of your committee members would be good enough to.

[Speaker 1] (5:02:50 - 5:03:01)
All right. So I'm going to ask Alderman Burnett moves to accept the substitute ordinance. All those in favor?

Any opposed? Ayes have it. Substitutes in front of us.

[Speaker 5] (5:03:01 - 5:04:57)
Thank you. And the proposed use would allow the use of the property for a contractor's yard and for the outdoor storage of trucks, trailers, vehicles, and equipment as a principal use. The subject property years ago was occupied by the Standard Coal Company for years as their business location.

After Standard Coal left over the years, it's been used as a contractor's yard, construction contractors for storage of vehicles, equipment, even materials. So there's a history there. Jeff has been working with the Alderman's office with respect to this zoning change.

And I'd like to mention that separate and apart from his application, he did give the Alderman a letter and represented that, number one, he would erect a solid screening fence along the property. And just to explain, part of the property already has a solid masonry fence, but part of it also has a chain link fence. So he promised he'd replace the chain link with a solid fence to screen the operation from the outside.

Also, no excessive idling of motor vehicles, no storage of scrap or debris, and also that he would collaborate with the community organizations and residents on beautification projects. Part of the existing solid masonry fence, the neighbors have already painted a mural on that solid wall. So he promised that when he does the new portion of the fence to replace the chain link, he would also work with the community to see what they'd recommend to beautify the new portion of the fence.

So with that, again, worked with the Alderman and the staff and asked her for his support for this change. And I believe she wrote a letter.

[Speaker 1] (5:04:59 - 5:05:19)
I believe we have a letter from Alderman Garza. Questions from committee members? Hearing none.

Motion Alderman Lopez to pass as amended. All those in favor? Any opposed?

Opinions? Chair, the ayes have it and the item is passed.

[Speaker 5] (5:05:20 - 5:05:20)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (5:05:20 - 5:06:00)
All right, moving on. Top of page 21. Item number 20085 in the 6th Ward.

Ordinance referred on July 24th of 19. Common address 7810 through 12, South Indiana. Change request.

RS2 residential single unit detached house district to an RT3.5 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district. All right. Good afternoon, Mr. Toomey and members of the committee.

[Speaker 41] (5:06:02 - 5:08:15)
For the record, my name is Louis W. Powell III. I'm an attorney with Offices 53 West Jackson in Chicago.

I have with me today Mr. Gregory Phillips and who represents the Gregory Phillips Trust. He's the owner of the trust and the owner and applicant of the property located at 7810 to 12, South Indiana Avenue. Mr. Chairman and committee, Mr. Phillips bought the property in March of 2016. There was six existing dwelling units on site. Mr. Phillips hired an architect and filed an application for a building permit to rehab the property. It was then informed that the two basement units had not been legally established.

The subject property is a two-story with a basement brick apartment building on a 9,624 square foot lot with six off-street parking spaces. We went to Alderman Sawyer and were informed that he would support the MAP amendment to legalize the existing condition. Chairman, in order to accomplish this, we have filed an application to amend the zoning of this 9,624 square foot lot from a RS-2 residential single unit detached house district to a RT-3.5 two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district. For the record, Mr. Chairman, I have to my immediate right, again, the owner, Mr. Gregory Phillips, and to his right, Kareem Masawar, our land planning consultant. We have had the support of the Alderman, Alderman Sawyer, and for the record, we have sent proper notice to the community. And we have been in contact with Alderman Sawyer, and the letter is on the way, and I think he's indicated support personally to the zoning staff.

Should the chairman of the committee have any questions, we are available to answer. We seek your approval by application to amend the zoning on this property from RS-2 to RT-3.5 so Mr. Phillips and his architect can complete the rehab of the building, and I thank you and the committee, and again, I appreciate the assistance of the zoning staff.

[Speaker 1] (5:08:16 - 5:08:20)
All right. So we have heard from the Alderman, and he is in support.

[Speaker 41] (5:08:20 - 5:08:21)
Thank you.

[Speaker 10] (5:08:22 - 5:09:06)
Questions for the applicant? Alderman Beal. So basically, this was an illegal conversion when you bought it?

Okay. So have you obtained full architecture drawings, and you've gone through the whole permitting process in order to bring everything in compliance with the city code? That's unfortunate.

All right. Have you looked to, you know, sue the people you bought it from for purchasing it, or did you purchase it as is? Okay.

Thank you. Get it out. I mean, completely tore down, and I think I purchased it as is.

Thank you.

[Speaker 55] (5:09:07 - 5:09:08)
Thank you, Mr. Phillips.

[Speaker 1] (5:09:09 - 5:09:17)
Okay. For the record, would you identify yourself? Gregory Phillips.

Great. Just wanted to have it for the court reporter. Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 52] (5:09:19 - 5:09:19)
Thank you.

[Speaker 4] (5:09:19 - 5:09:44)
Thank you, Chairman. This question is actually for the department. I know we had this discussion not too long ago about the certificate of zoning and things of that nature, but it sounds like, was this an abandoned house, sir?

Yeah. So if a gentleman were to purchase an abandoned property from a bank or whatever, are they still required to give them the certificate of zoning for that property as they would like a normal realtor sale?

[Speaker 58] (5:09:45 - 5:10:06)
Yes, they're still required to, but a lot of times they'll just take it, whatever comes out or whatever they think is in the building, they'll just give it to us, and we'll approve it based on their stating what's in the building. So with a lot of the bank sales, we do have that problem. Okay.

[Speaker 4] (5:10:06 - 5:10:55)
So I think, once again, we're going to have to, at some point, have a larger discussion, Chairman, because we keep seeing this, and especially, you know, we just had somebody who was here, Volunteers for America, who said, we want to rehab buildings. You know, this is going to be the trap that keeps getting people. We've seen it meeting after meeting after meeting, and I think in your situation, it's slightly different, but it's still, what you think the building is, not necessarily is what the building is, and finding a more sustainable solution than forcing our homeowners or entrepreneurs or investors to have to go through this circus to get it fixed.

At some point, there's something we have to take a deeper dive into.

[Speaker 58] (5:10:56 - 5:11:29)
And Alderman, excuse me. All right. Alderman, I'm sorry, just one more time.

Steve. Steve Valenziano, Department of Planning. We are working, and we'll be working over this next, this fall and winter, on ordinance to help address this with existing buildings, with older buildings, to help, so they don't have to come here and do this.

So we are working on that, and we would be happy to have your involvement in that also. Thank you. And I remember you guys mentioned that last time.

[Speaker 4] (5:11:29 - 5:11:35)
Every time I hear this story, it just aggravates the crap out of it before.

[Speaker 1] (5:11:36 - 5:11:50)
Okay. Any other questions from committee members? If not, Alderman Beal moves to pass.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

I didn't hear the ayes. That item is passed. Good luck to you.

[Speaker 41] (5:11:51 - 5:11:51)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (5:11:52 - 5:12:37)
All right. On to page 22, document number 20095-T1 in the second ward, ordinance referred July 24th of 19, common address 413 through 415 West North Avenue, change request B33, community shopping district to a C13, neighborhood commercial district. Are we coming down?

All right. Great. Good afternoon.

For the record.

[Speaker 48] (5:12:37 - 5:13:49)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Daniel Box. I'm an attorney with the Law Offices of Sam Banks, located at 221 North LaSalle.

I'm here today on behalf of Team Fight Sports, LLC, the intended tenant at the subject property, located at 413 through 15 West North Avenue. The applicant is proposing to establish a computer gaming and training center at the subject site. The proposed use is classified as an arcade, thereby triggering the need for the requested zoning change to a C1 zoning district.

Other than the interior build-out of the retail space, the existing three-story, eight-dwelling unit building will remain without change. The site is also located within 200 feet of the CTA Sedgwick Brown Line train station and is a transit-served location. As such, no new parking is proposed for the arcade use.

I believe that Alderman Hopkins has already provided a letter of support, but as I saw earlier, he was here. We got a letter. Great.

If he's still here, I'll defer to him for final comment. Otherwise, that rests our case.

[Speaker 1] (5:13:49 - 5:13:50)
I think he's left.

[Speaker 48] (5:13:53 - 5:13:53)
Finished?

[Speaker 1] (5:13:54 - 5:13:58)
Yes. Okay, questions on this application from committee members?

[Speaker 10] (5:14:00 - 5:14:06)
Alderman Beal. So basically, this is like, I mean, give me some background on exactly what this is.

[Speaker 39] (5:14:08 - 5:15:03)
It says arcade, but what is, can you describe what the activity is? So the designation's pretty, oh, I'm sorry. My name's Ryan Kim.

I am the owner and founder of N1 Athletics or Team Fight Sports LLC. The concept is pretty new. We're looking to create what is called an e-sports gym.

The idea is to take the best elements of traditional sports that exist today and apply that to e-sports, which is competitive video gaming. The goal is to make it a more productive activity for the youth involved and parents who are struggling with some of the problems that gaming seems to bring for kids. The goal is to have coaching with two practices a week, weekend matches, bring all the best aspects of practicing competitive gameplay, being with the team and the social aspects and put that onto a single physical location, which we're calling e-sports gym.

Very unique. Thank you. Good job.

[Speaker 1] (5:15:05 - 5:15:16)
Actually, I think this is really expanding. That's correct. E-sports in general has a huge new category of competitiveness.

[Speaker 65] (5:15:19 - 5:15:19)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (5:15:20 - 5:15:29)
Any other questions from committee members? Alderman, did you have a question, Alderman Lopez? Nope.

Nope. Okay. Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 4] (5:15:30 - 5:15:35)
Thank you, Chairman. I have to say I was disappointed. I thought this was going to be like Fight Club.

You were going to put on there.

[Speaker 1] (5:15:35 - 5:15:39)
No, it's all video anyway. It's video, but no, I was looking for, you know.

[Speaker 4] (5:15:39 - 5:16:02)
Yeah. So is this the first of its kind in Chicago? Yes, that's correct.

And you loosely alluded to the problems of video gaming. I'm assuming you're referring to like violent video games and everything that, you know, President Trump associates with them and that kind of stuff.

[Speaker 39] (5:16:03 - 5:16:04)
Yes, that's part of the problems, yeah.

[Speaker 4] (5:16:05 - 5:16:46)
But so to counter that, because I'm sure there are people like myself who don't necessarily believe that, you know, video games are the root cause of all evil in society. What exactly does that entail on your end that you're providing? Because I don't think like in a physical gym, we have counselors who teach people who are getting trained to box not to hit people without their helmets or without their gloves.

So are you doing this just out of the abundance of caution? Is this a model that you've seen and you're emulating from somewhere else? Or what drives that?

[Speaker 39] (5:16:47 - 5:18:05)
This is actually not a model we've seen elsewhere. I think one of the problems in terms of the violence from video games that you've alluded to, I'm in agreement with you. I don't think video games have anything to do with violent tendencies.

However, that is something that parents have expressed concerns with. And therefore, the games that we are selecting to be part of our training regimen are selected because they are much more strategically and tactically focused and not so much on the violence end. The other problems that we've been looking at are things like addiction to gaming or any sort of emotional behavior that comes from losing games, for example.

We believe that having coaches who are experienced the games that these kids enjoy, having a role model that is the one that's telling them, look, playing beyond two, three hours a day is pretty mentally taxing and not great for your gameplay. It doesn't help you improve. And using eSports really as a vehicle to take that energy and move it into something that's a little bit more life skills oriented.

That's what we're looking to do. I don't think we're saying that we need psychologists on hand. And I would be the last person trained for that kind of stuff.

But we are taking precautions as best we can against some of these problems.

[Speaker 4] (5:18:05 - 5:18:27)
Thank you. I think just that human interaction having the coach is probably going to be more beneficial than anything. Because otherwise, these individuals would be playing Fortnite and Minecraft or whatever it is in their room for nine hours a day with no sunlight, no people, no nothing.

So good luck. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (5:18:27 - 5:18:42)
All right. Other questions? If not, I'll then deal moves to pass on this item.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

Opinion chair, the ayes have it. Good luck. And hopefully, whether we like it or not, there'll be an expansion of this industry.

[Speaker 39] (5:18:43 - 5:18:43)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (5:18:44 - 5:19:08)
Thank you. Bottom of page 22, application number 20119, second ward, ordinance referred again July 24th of 19, common address 1 West Superior. Plan development number 237 to plan development 237 as amended.

All right. Katie.

[Speaker 8] (5:19:08 - 5:19:47)
Thank you. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Katie Jankydale from the law firm of DLA Piper located at 444 West Lake, which represents 1 Superior Place Fee LLC, the applicant for a plan development amendment for the property located at 1 West Superior.

With me today are representatives from the property owner and operating team. As you said, the applicant seeks to rezone the property from PD 237 to PD 237 as amended to allow for hotels of permitted use. This request was considered and recommended for approval by the planning commission on August 16, 2019.

And we respectfully request that the findings and transcript from the planning commission hearing be incorporated into the record.

[Speaker 1] (5:19:48 - 5:19:56)
So Alderman Beal moves to incorporate the records from the planning commission. All in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Records are incorporated.

[Speaker 8] (5:19:56 - 5:20:44)
The site is located in the block founded by Superior, State, Huron, and Dearborn. It's currently occupied by an existing building containing 809 rental units and 657 parking spaces. The applicant proposes a technical amendment to the existing PD to allow for up to 20% of the units to be utilized for short-term stays.

No exterior construction or other changes to the building are contemplated in connection with this request. We've worked with Alderman Hopkins, the River North Residents Association, and DPD on this project. And you should have letters of support from both the alderman and RNRA on file.

Additionally, we hosted eight hours of resident events over two days at the property to discuss the proposed use with building residents and answer any questions they had. Our team is available to answer any questions you may have and respectfully request you recommend city council approval of this application. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (5:20:45 - 5:21:09)
Any questions from committee members? Hearing none, Alderman Beal moves due pass as revised. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? Committee chair, the ayes have it and it will be passed as revised.

Thank you very much. All right. Why do I have to owe Alderman Beal?

[Speaker 65] (5:21:10 - 5:21:11)
I know.

[Speaker 1] (5:21:12 - 5:21:43)
All right. Let's go to the deferred agenda. Are we on 47th Ward?

Yep. Okay. Item number 20061-T1 in the 47th Ward referred on June 12th of 19.

Common address 4241 Ravenswood Avenue, change request M12 Limited Manufacturing Business Park District to C32 Commercial Manufacturing and Employment District. Counselor.

[Speaker 6] (5:21:44 - 5:22:31)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman. Good evening, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name for the record is Thomas S.

Moore and with me today is Sonnet Barrinker-Hart who is the founder and owner of the Koval Distillery which was the first distillery in Chicago since Prohibition. And as a procedural matter, we were in front of the Planning Commission because this is in a manufacturing corridor and therefore we had to go to the Planning Commission. And so I'd ask that we adopt those findings into this record.

[Speaker 1] (5:22:31 - 5:22:41)
So Alderman Beal moves to incorporate the records from the Planning Commission. All those in favor, aye. Any opposed?

Seeing and hearing the ayes have it. Records are now incorporated.

[Speaker 6] (5:22:41 - 5:23:51)
Thank you. So this has been and is in a manufacturing district but Sonnet would like to expand her business to include a tasting room and a restaurant and after we go in front of the zoning board, a outdoor cafe. And in order to do that, having met with the zoning, the suggestion was that we go to a C-3-2 would be the best zoning to allow that to happen because it couldn't happen as such in the current M zone.

And so we had a community meeting at which the new Alderman Martin was amazed at the rapport and the good relationship that Koval has developed and has with all the neighbors. It was a love fest and it made the Alderman's job very easy and he therefore supports it and he asked for your support as well. It made your job a little easier too, right?

That's true too. Okay, great.

[Speaker 1] (5:23:51 - 5:24:00)
All right. It's very familiar with Ravenswood Corridor. This would be the outdoor spaces that unique to that corridor.

[Speaker 51] (5:24:02 - 5:24:27)
Here you go. Sure. There are already some outdoor spaces on the corridor.

In fact, the building next to ours has a little small outdoor seating area. Yeah, right outside the building. So ours would be actually within the confines of the building which is inset.

We have a parking lot area and that's where the outdoor area would be. So it'd be within the building in a way.

[Speaker 1] (5:24:28 - 5:24:49)
Exciting. So with that, any questions? Committee members?

If not, Alderman Beal moves to pass as revised. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? The chair of the ayes have it and this item is passed as revised. All right.

[Speaker 45] (5:24:49 - 5:24:50)
Thank you very much. All right.

[Speaker 1] (5:24:50 - 5:24:52)
Is this the last one?

[Speaker 64] (5:24:52 - 5:24:53)
Last one.

[Speaker 1] (5:24:54 - 5:25:27)
Okay, last but not least in the document number. 20064 in the 42nd Ward. Ordinance referred on June 12th of 19.

Common address 301 West Huron and also 308 West Erie. Change request DX5 Downtown Mixed Use District to a business plan development. All right.

Katie?

[Speaker 8] (5:25:27 - 5:26:00)
Thank you. Good afternoon again, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. And from the record, my name is Katie Jinkydale from the law firm of DLA Piper located at 444 West Lake which represents NWC 308 W Erie LLC, the applicant for this matter.

With me today are representatives from the property owner and architecture team. As you said, the applicant seeks to rezone the property from the DX5 Downtown Mixed Use District to a business plan development. This request was considered and recommended for approval by the Planning Commission on August 16th.

And we respectfully request the finding and transcript from that Planning Commission hearing be incorporated into the record.

[Speaker 1] (5:26:01 - 5:26:07)
Alderman Beal moves to incorporate the records from Planning Commission. All those in favor, aye. Any opposed?

[Speaker 27] (5:26:08 - 5:26:10)
The ayes have it and the records are incorporated.

[Speaker 8] (5:26:10 - 5:26:56)
Thank you. The property consists of approximately 30,000 square feet located on the West side of Franklin between Huron and Erie. It is currently occupied by a surface parking lot and an existing seven-story building.

The applicant proposes a two sub-area PD. Sub-area A located at 308 West Erie will be improved with a six-story addition to the existing seven-story building. Sub-area B located at 301 West Huron will be improved with a new 16-story building.

Both buildings will contain ground floor commercial and office above. 130 parking spaces will be provided. The applicant has worked closely with Alderman Riley and the River North Residents Association on this matter, both of whom have provided a letter of support.

Our team is available for any questions and respectfully request that you recommend City Council approval of this application. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (5:26:59 - 5:26:59)
All right.

[Speaker 8] (5:27:03 - 5:27:03)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (5:27:04 - 5:27:15)
Okay. Questions on this? So you've said you've met with Alderman Riley.

We have a letter of support. I know he's not here.

[Speaker 17] (5:27:15 - 5:27:16)
We have that.

[Speaker 1] (5:27:16 - 5:27:19)
Okay. Any other questions for the committee?

[Speaker 10] (5:27:19 - 5:27:39)
Comment, Mr. Chairman. I just want to give this group a lot of credit because they stayed awake the entire, the entire, you know, I was watching them in the back and, you know, I didn't see one eyelid close the entire meeting. So I want to commend them for, you know, staying for the entire meeting.

[Speaker 1] (5:27:40 - 5:28:10)
Then I know that you will motion do pass this item as revised. Okay. All those in favor.

Aye. Any opposed? Can you share the ayes?

Have it passed as revised. And Alderman Beal makes a motion to adjourn. All those in favor.

Yes, indeed. Have a good evening and thank you for your patience. Thank you, department.

I know it's two months of, two months of application.
