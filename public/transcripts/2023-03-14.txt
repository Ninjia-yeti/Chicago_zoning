[Speaker 1] (15:45 - 18:52)
And to whom most I say farewell, my very own secret, and mama ain't well, yeah, she's been sleeping, and she's been listening to each other howling down the hill, howling, howling. Alderman Moore, Alderman Siccio Lopez, Mike Rodriguez, Alderman Burnett, Alderman Cardona, Alderman Wagesbeck, I know he's coming, Alderman Villegas, Alderman Riley, Alderman Kappelman, Alderman Osterman, Alderwoman Hadden, and Chairman Tunney here.

Any objections? Hearing no objections, these items have and will be deferred. Let's see, how many speakers do we have today?

We have two public speakers sign up for today's hearing and we'll hear from them now. We'll start with Mr. George Blakemore.

[Speaker 9] (18:56 - 22:00)
As a concerned citizen, I'm not a pop-up. You know, you put a ruling that was against the rule. That's what happened to Salish, the previous chairman.

When a citizen comes and you have 12 items, the citizen has a right to speak on all 12 items. He shouldn't or she shouldn't be limited to one item. So you brought that rule in and now you're on your way out.

That's what happened to Salish. Waste, fraud, and abuse is going on right here in this zoning committee. When something is zoned irregular lots, I saw it right up here on Gophers and Dearborn.

Little lots, you couldn't build nothing. Money talks and bull walks. This is where the corrupt comes in, right here in zoning.

That's got Burton and all of them. It's indicted. Zoning.

And you see the same political attorney hacks come in every month from white influential law firms. And if you got money, you can rezone anything, anywhere that you want. Money talks and bull walks.

Right here is corrupt. Fraud and abuse. And then you tell the citizen, did you hear from, I'm glad Lady Life was stopped back.

But you have to go to your little mini alterman. And then they supposed to have a little, they rig up a little community meeting. And the alterman, if he says this, they go like a little dictator.

So, so long to you, sir. I watched how you abused me when I came up here and changed the rules. Now, things going to be changed.

You not going to be here. So, again, the game go on and on. And the reason it go like this, because you have no citizen participation.

Everybody here is trying to get something redone. And you should educate your public that you can redone anything on your own. You don't need a political connected attorney.

You can come up as a citizen and present that. So, I want to know the time, the date that the community met. What was the result?

And the technology should be there. They show who voted for what and everything. You, you, so long to you, sir.

Bye bye. Goodbye to you. And I hope.

[Speaker 1] (22:01 - 22:19)
Thank you, Mr. Blakemore. We have been joined by Alderman Moore. And I think.

And Alderman Wagesbeck. Added, added to the forum call. Our next speaker is Adam Peterson.

[Speaker 15] (22:26 - 24:09)
Morning. Good morning. Thank you Chairman Tunney and fellow members of the zoning landmarks and building standards committee for the opportunity to speak today.

I'm Adam Peterson, the good food purchasing program coordinator for the Chicago Food Policy Action Council, the council partners with communities to advocate and to implement policies that advance food sovereignty in the Chicagoland region. I'm speaking in support of the amendments of the municipal code chapters four dash eight and 17 dash nine regarding the licensing of urban farms and community gardens. By moving this amendment forward, the city will expand opportunities for the production of local sustainable and fairly produced foods within the city.

Currently commercial urban agriculture producers are shoehorned into other license types, which are expensive and don't properly cover their commercial activity. This has been an ongoing issue since 2011 when the commercial agricultural zone was added to the zoning code, without a parallel license to reflect the zoning change. We're excited to see this ordinance move forward after 12 years of discussion and advocacy efforts.

Creating a parallel license for commercial growers will legally and safely welcome them into Chicago's local economy. Bolstering job opportunities, community welfare and public health and safety. Urban agriculture provides opportunities for community members and entrepreneurs, particularly on the south and west sides of Chicago to transform vacant and empty lots into vibrant spaces for food growing and community gathering.

We are elated for this ordinance to move forward in time for the upcoming growing season. Thanks for your time and your support for this important change. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (24:09 - 24:15)
Thank you for your testimony. I think that concludes our public comment period.

[Speaker 3] (24:15 - 24:20)
Chairman, we have one virtual speaker, Viviana Okapu.

[Speaker 1] (24:21 - 24:27)
Okay. And our virtual speaker, if you would identify yourself and proceed.

[Speaker 4] (24:28 - 24:29)
Can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (24:29 - 24:30)
We can.

[Speaker 4] (24:31 - 24:49)
Great. My name is Viviana Okapu. I'm the cooperation steward with Advocates for Urban Agriculture, AUA.

I'm a CPS graduate. I've been helping to run a community garden in my neighborhood since 2012. I've co-owned and run an indoor urban agriculture business in Chicago, and I'm an urban agriculture technical assistance provider.

[Speaker 1] (24:49 - 24:53)
Could you hold on a second? I think you just speak a little bit louder and a little bit slower.

[Speaker 4] (24:54 - 24:55)
Gotcha.

[Speaker 1] (24:55 - 24:56)
Okay.

[Speaker 4] (24:56 - 28:04)
All right. As I said, my name is Viviana Okapu. I'm the cooperation steward with Advocates for Urban Agriculture.

I'm a CPS graduate. I've been helping to run a community garden in my neighborhood since 2012. I've co-owned and run an indoor agriculture business in Chicago.

I'm an urban agriculture technical assistance provider, and my American family has been living in Chicago since the 1920s. I'm the co-lead of the Urban Ag Working Group of the Food Equity Council, alongside DPD's Brad Roback. And together with the Food Equity Council, we work directly with the Chicago Park District, DCASE, BACP, AIS, the Greater Chicago Food Depository, our local Food Policy Council, multiple local urban ag-focused nonprofits, private and public investment, farm business owners, and community gardeners to draft a substitute ordinance that is up for your consideration right now.

I'm calling in support of passing the Urban Agriculture Business License Enhancement Ordinance. And while the ordinance itself is a simple modification to the produce license as defined in Chapter 4-8-010 and 17-9 of the City Code, its impact has the potential to be huge. As an urban agriculture technical assistance provider in Chicago, I can attest to the fact that none of the current licenses available are a good fit for our local urban agriculture businesses and organizations.

Yet, there are many food producers in Chicago who are ready for this updated license. As of February, the federal boost in additional SNAP allotments came to a close. Those SNAP dollars became available due to the COVID-19 pandemic relief funds, and those additional SNAP dollars helped thousands of families in Chicago facing financial hardship to meet their food needs.

Recent inflation has caused food prices to skyrocket, so now we're left with a situation where food is significantly more expensive and people have less money to purchase it. Better food right now near our homes, better than we've had access to for decades, is possible through this ordinance. Many of our neighborhoods, especially where vacant lots are available for sale, are experiencing food apartheid with continued grocery store closings.

As local Chicago land-based growers, we care way more about our neighbors to make sure we have local sources of food than a national or an international grocery chain. We are the ones who are living the health impacts of the lack of access to quality and locally grown food. Heart disease, diabetes, cancer, asthma are out of control in our neighborhoods, and it has been shown time and time again that these Chicagoans-turned-numbers are affected by the health of our environment.

On the particulars of the ordinance, I have to note that it is a complicated request to require an attestation on the conditions of soil under the operation requirements for the Produce Merchants No. 18. Many of the contaminants that are present in our soils throughout Chicago have found their way to that soil through the decisions of the past and present Zoning Committee and on what gets to happen in our neighborhoods.

With this ordinance, we have the opportunity to activate Chicagoans on improving our soil. Can I continue, or is that it?

[Speaker 1] (28:05 - 28:10)
Is that your concluding statement? I know I interrupted you for a second. Do you have a sentence or two more?

[Speaker 4] (28:11 - 28:37)
I have more for sure. With the federal SNAP assistance that ended in February, I would say that if history has shown us anything, it's that it's important to make sure that humans have safe food to eat, ideally as abundantly as possible. All of our futures depend on our food system.

Please make the changes now to provide for generations to come. Please pass the ordinance to City Council for a vote. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (28:38 - 28:39)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 4] (28:39 - 28:40)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (28:40 - 30:08)
Do we have any more virtual speakers? No, Chairman, that was it. Okay.

All right. We will start off today with the addendum to the agenda. First item on the addendum is document number 02022-3989, the amendment municipal codes 4-8 and 17-9, regarding the licensing of urban farms and community gardens.

The item has a substitute. All members of the committee should have received the substitute, as well as a summary electronically. You have a few up here if you need them.

There's also, if I'm not mistaken, a copy in your folder. Is that correct? Okay.

First of all, I'd like to ask for a motion to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Cardona makes the motion to accept the substitute. Any objections?

Hearing none, the substitute is before us. We have Ruby Ferguson, the food equity policy lead in the mayor's office to present on this matter, as well as representatives from various departments to answer questions. And obviously we had a couple of public speakers comment on it also.

Yeah. Well, first of all, I'll ask Ruby to just at least outline closed ordinance and then we'll, we have a few questions from committee members right off the bat. All right.

Ruby.

[Speaker 7] (30:08 - 33:52)
Yes. Good morning. And thank you so much for taking the time today.

I'm going to walk through the urban agriculture business license enhancement ordinance and walk through some of those changes. For context, a lot of this work is coming out of our food equity work and really thinking about how we can make Chicago's food system more just and equitable with a focus on increasing our access to fruits and vegetables across the city. In June of 2021, the first ever food equity agenda for Chicago was published that outlined five priorities to think about how we can create a more equitable food system and increase access to local foods here in Chicago.

And one of those priorities was eliminating barriers that currently exist for urban agriculture, including selling produce directly to community. So this ordinance creates a pathway for growers to sell whole uncut unprocessed produce from a produce stand on the community garden or urban farm directly to consumers or businesses. The ordinance does not make any changes to the zoning code in terms of where community gardens or urban farms can be located, and it does not allow for the selling of processed produce that's grown on that urban farm or community garden.

And a little bit of grounding, a community garden is typically a garden that grows fresh produce, but also has a community oriented purpose like gathering or job training, et cetera, whereas an urban farm is selling that produce for solely for commercial commercial purposes. And so when we were exploring different pathways on how we could support urban agriculture business here in Chicago, we started looking at the produce merchant license as it had the pathway to make a few small changes to better meet the business needs of growers here in the city. And so those small changes start with allowing the license to be held city wide.

Previously it was required that operations had to occur in 33% of communities with limited food access. And so we took away that limitation so that way any community garden or urban farm could sell produce directly to community, especially since food insecurity is not only indicative of your proximity to a grocery store. The second piece is allowing the produce stand to stay up overnight in the middle of the grow season.

Growers have to tend to the land and maintain that and taking down that produce stand each day can add additional burdens for growers. And then the last piece is allowing them to sell directly to consumers and retailers, but continuing to allow it to be whole, uncut, unprocessed produce that's grown onsite and either in raised beds or in an engineered barrier. And then produce stands would have to follow the requirements listed here.

So they would have to be located on the community garden or urban farm in which the produce is grown. They would have to be used solely for the selling of that produce. And the size limitations require that they cannot exceed 150 square feet in area or 15 feet in height.

And then they would have to follow setback requirements. So 15 feet from the front of the property line and five feet away from each side of the property line. And then they are not allowed to be operated on any site that contains one or more dwelling units.

Lastly, these recommendations were co-created with community leaders and city departments on the urban agricultural work group of the food equity council. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (33:52 - 33:56)
Thank you, Ruby. We're going to start with Alderman Raymond Lopez.

[Speaker 5] (33:58 - 34:36)
Thank you, chairman. As somebody who has a number of urban farms in my ward and somebody who has some of the original urban agricultural repurposed buildings in the city of Chicago in my ward, I have some definite concerns because though we've heard from testimony that this is great for the south and west side. I think that there are still a lot of concerns.

I know that we've had going back even as far as 2019 with regards to what we consider permissible when it comes to urban agriculture within the city of Chicago. And I would ask that we defer this item until we could have more resolution on this matter.

[Speaker 1] (34:39 - 35:50)
So there has been a motion on the floor to defer this, to get obviously more input from communities that have a lot of gardens in it. Do we have a, do we need, do we need a second on that? So is there any opposition to deferring this item until the next meeting?

Hearing none. Do you want to speak Mike before? Thank you.

We're going to, we're going to take, we're going to accept the motion, but did you have a point of information or you're just, you're just going to hold it? I think we're going to hold it. Okay.

And I think part of that is to just do more. I know there was a lot of community groups that were behind Ruby, as you said. My understanding is that I think more outreach, maybe some meetings with the impacted alderman that have community gardens in their neighborhood might be prudent so we can get this thing moving for spring.

All right. So the motion to defer any objection to that motion hearing on this item will be deferred. Okay.

[Speaker 2] (35:54 - 35:55)
Let me see.

[Speaker 1] (35:56 - 36:02)
Now we're okay.

[Speaker 3] (36:02 - 36:02)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (36:02 - 36:59)
Next item on the addendum is document number 0 2 0 2 1 dash 21 31. The amendment of municipal code regarding general district standards for indoor and outdoor operations and use standards for outdoor walk up service windows. The, this item also has a substitute.

All members of the committee should have received a copy of the substitute as well as a summary electronically. Again, you'll find a copy of this in your folder. First, I want to ask for a motion to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Alderman Lopez makes the motion to accept the substitute. Any objections hearing on the substitute is before us. We're going to start with our colleague Alderman Matt Martin present on the matter.

I know Matt and I've worked very closely on this for many, many, many months. So Matt, would you want to give our colleagues a summation of what we're doing and what we're possibly not doing? Yeah, absolutely.

[Speaker 10] (36:59 - 38:58)
Thank you, chair. And to start really appreciate your, your leadership and guidance on this because it has been a long process. So the genesis of this was there were a few businesses who had reached out to my office, both current businesses and prospective businesses saying that they want or need.

To be able to operate a walk up window sometimes because pandemic spikes sometimes because of space constraints, bakeries are a good example. Ice cream shops. And they said right now, based on municipal code, it's just really challenging for us to navigate permitting and zoning and the like.

And so had a number of conversations with BACP, with Sony, with law with you and a lot of our colleagues. And at the end of the day, what we came to in terms of a proposal is the substitute that's before this committee that would essentially say, if you are a food establishment and you have zoning B1, B2, B3, or C1, then you could operate a walk up window. There are a number of constraints around that, including being able to allow the sort of queuing outside of the business.

And also that you could not distribute certain things through walk up windows, most notably cigarettes and alcohol, that there are time considerations as well. You couldn't operate it between midnight and 7. And I think this is at bottom, the sort of thing that will allow businesses to adapt to the circumstances that COVID has brought.

And while knock on wood, the worst of the pandemics behind us, there is a new normal in place. And I think this represents compromise. We'll provide businesses flexibility, but still ensures that our offices and our communities will have a say in terms of how businesses are operating.

So I'll leave it at that and happy to kick it back to you, chair.

[Speaker 1] (38:59 - 40:03)
Thank you, Matt. And thank you for your patience and working with the various groups. As I've said to you and probably our colleagues, this is evident of what's actually happening in the marketplace.

Number one, Number two is we are specifically, you know, heavily emphasized eating and drinking establishments and people with, with robust retail food. So with that, you know, there will be a, you know, An evaluation of this to see how the, you know, how, how the ordinance has, you know, practice practicality. And to see whether working with Irma and other people that will probably be interested in potentially experimenting with themselves.

I think it's a good first step. So I want to thank you for, I know how hard you worked on this. And the other, I know we have Patrick here from zoning.

Tell us a little bit more about your aspect of it, and especially some of the ex exceptions, the Navy pier and downtown area and such.

[Speaker 11] (40:03 - 41:30)
Sure. Hi, Patrick Murphy with the department of planning. There are two main aspects to this ordinance.

One covers the zoning side. And then Max Budovich is here from BACP to talk about some of the licensing aspects from a zoning standpoint in the neighborhood zoning districts. So in all of your B districts, Plus your C ones business activities are supposed to take place now within fully enclosed structures.

There are certain exemptions dealing with gas stations, dealing with restaurants that have outdoor seating areas. This adds an exception to that, that allows you to have an operable walk-up window, you know, a can, if you think of a drive-through without the, without the vehicular lane, a window that food can be passed out to individuals, no alcohol it limits under this structure, food that's prepared on site that can come up a little bit further in what Max can testify to, but it essentially supplements existing exemptions that already exist in the neighborhood zoning districts. It does not impact business activities downtown.

They're already exempt from this prohibition as well as any other outdoor activity restrictions. For instance, in manufacturing districts that also have restaurants, they're not subject to this prohibition today as well. So this exemption applies to B1, B2 and B3 and C1 zoning district.

So your neighborhood business and low lowest scale commercial district.

[Speaker 1] (41:30 - 41:36)
All right. Hold on a second. Let me get BACP to respond from the licensing side.

[Speaker 12] (41:36 - 42:21)
Sure. Max Budovich deputy commissioner over licenses and permits from BACP. I think Alderman Martin and Patrick stated it beautifully.

Really the licensing restrictions here are that walk-up windows would have operating hours from 7am to midnight. No, there would be no sale of alcoholic liquor permitted through the window except for the, the various exemptions noted in the ordinance, namely Navy pier license liquor licenses, like lakefront liquor licenses and the riverwalk licenses, as well as when there is during the operating hours of a sidewalk cafe that has been properly permitted adjacent to the, to the establishment with the window. And then also no sale of cigarettes or other tobacco products as defined.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (42:23 - 42:30)
Great. All right. Now questions.

I see Alderman Moore, please. Oh, I'm sorry. Okay.

We'll do David first and then we'll go to Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 3] (42:31 - 43:21)
Thank you so much chairman. So I just want to be clear because I was reading this and I was asking Matt and he said, these are some questions I would probably have to ask BACP. So I want to ask them here why they're now, before we move with this right now, there's a potbellies in the 21st ward.

And so right now they shouldn't be legally doing it, but under this law, I mean, under this ordinance, they would be able to do it. And so I experienced that during their operating hours, they were operating the window, not letting people in to sit down and operating the window. So is there something that says that during the operating hours, it's that they can't, that they can only then just choose to, you know, serve out the window.

What would prohibit them from that?

[Speaker 1] (43:23 - 43:31)
Let me try to rephrase your, your question, being a restaurant person. So potbellies is open X number of hours of the day.

[Speaker 27] (43:31 - 43:32)
Right.

[Speaker 1] (43:32 - 43:57)
Okay. Let's say it's 7 00 AM to midnight. All right.

So if this ordinance passed, they can obviously have sit down and they can have to go at the simultaneously. I think your question might be, correct me if I'm wrong. If the restaurant is not open for indoor seating, can they open only for the window service?

[Speaker 3] (43:58 - 44:00)
Right. When it's not a pandemic or anything.

[Speaker 1] (44:00 - 44:09)
No, no. I mean, these are operational decisions that, you know, management makes. So, man, you want to talk, answer that question?

[Speaker 12] (44:10 - 44:35)
Yeah. So again, Max Budovich deputy commissioner at BACP Alderman. Thank you for the question.

I think the way to think about it is, is it's really a business decision. The, the business can operate under this ordinance again, based on the zoning district would be able to operate their walk up window legally. They could also operate with indoor seating.

They could operate either, or again, within those operating hours for the window, at least.

[Speaker 3] (44:35 - 45:09)
So it's a business decision is long story short, which would be a problem for many of our communities. I'm telling you that right now. I, that would just be a problem.

And it was a, it was a problem even if they're doing it legally, because I saw it happen and people standing out in the cold, just freaking complaining about, you know, you know, getting served now if it's, Hey, after hours and you choose to stand out there in that cold, that's one thing, but I think it'll put an undue burden on some communities that really do.

[Speaker 1] (45:09 - 45:14)
Are you, are you mentioning during COVID when most of the indoor seating was?

[Speaker 3] (45:14 - 45:30)
No, no, no. I'm just talking to, no, this was, this was happening after, this was after COVID, you know? And so, and I could just see it and, and certain communities people taking advantage of this for the wrong reasons.

[Speaker 1] (45:32 - 45:33)
Point taken.

[Speaker 3] (45:35 - 46:02)
And then my other last question was, and, and he said it to depend on what zoning is. And if like Maxwell street, I don't know if that's in a C one or B one district, if that would be impacted with the hours. And I'm going to say Maxwell street, we meaning the polo Sasha stands that's open on Maxwell street.

I don't know. Cause I don't know what zoning there that that is. And it would impact them from that time standpoint.

[Speaker 1] (46:06 - 46:08)
I don't know what the underlying zoning is. Okay.

[Speaker 11] (46:08 - 46:56)
So I Patrick Murphy from the department of planning Alderman. So today there could be actually, I know that there are businesses that do this activity today in the neighborhoods. They, if they do it correctly, they seek a rezoning or they seek a map amendment to go to a C two or a C three district.

So the potbellies that you're referencing very well may have zoning today that allows them to carry that out legally without you know, without needing this license and without being in violation of the zoning code. There are planned developments and there are, like I was saying before, developments in downtown zoning that can proceed with this activity absent this ordinance by right. So it is allowed in certain locations.

This just allows it in all of our business and commercial districts throughout the city.

[Speaker 3] (46:56 - 47:06)
Yeah. And that's, that's why I said, there's not a one size fit all, and I'm not opposed to it. If it's, you know, downtown, I just think on the South and the West side, I don't have more of a negative impact.

[Speaker 1] (47:09 - 47:25)
Point taken. But I think what Matt has said is specifically said, 7.00 AM to midnight, you could not have indoor seating. You can have your walk-up window only.

And I think that's a concern that you're bringing up. All right. Thank you.

[Speaker 11] (47:27 - 47:39)
Chairman. Could I just ask one other question, Max, since it's set up as a separate license, if there is a bad actor, maybe there could, you could discuss what could happen with the license if someone violates these terms.

[Speaker 12] (47:39 - 48:10)
Sure. Again, Max Budovich, deputy commissioner of BACP. It's, the way this is set up is, is it's as, or by right rather.

So the ordinance allows the operation of walk-up windows in terms of enforcement, we would take a complaint based based approach approach if there were violations of this ordinance or other concerns, like any concern regarding business operations or code violations, we, we could we have a number of enforcement tools to hold a bad operator or a responsible operator accountable.

[Speaker 3] (48:11 - 48:27)
Yeah. But in this case, it was legally, it wouldn't be a bad operator. It just wouldn't be good for certain communities.

That's all I'm saying. So in this instance, they wouldn't be a bad operator. They will be following the law that doesn't make them a bad operator.

It just makes, I think it's a bad practice for certain areas.

[Speaker 1] (48:29 - 48:42)
Bad community relations. The way I hear you. So, all right, Matt, did you want to say something?

No, Alderman. I asked him cause he's obviously the author of the ordinance. Raymond Lopez.

[Speaker 5] (48:43 - 49:24)
Thank you, chairman. And good morning again, everyone. I do want to thank our colleague Alderman Martin for reaching out the other day on this matter.

Look forward to supporting it cause I think it makes sense. But I do have one question with regards to the prohibition against selling alcohol through this walk-up. Is that only for businesses that do not currently have a liquor license are prohibited?

I saw there are four exceptions to who this prohibition does not apply to. So I just want to make sure that I'm reading that correctly.

[Speaker 1] (49:25 - 49:27)
So restate your question, Raymond.

[Speaker 5] (49:29 - 49:44)
Aside from those four exemptions for who can sell through those windows. Does this mean everyone is barred from selling alcoholic products out of a walk-up service window?

[Speaker 1] (49:45 - 49:49)
I think I know the answer, but I'm going to ask Matt to respond to that. Max, I'm sorry.

[Speaker 12] (49:50 - 50:03)
Max Badovich, a deputy commissioner, BACP Alderman. The answer to that question is yes, there are the several exemptions here. Aside from those exemptions, alcohol is prohibited from passing through the walk-up window.

[Speaker 5] (50:04 - 50:28)
So I guess my question is no one should be selling alcohol who doesn't have a liquor license. Correct? Right.

So why is there a necessary clause to say that no one's selling alcohol should be selling alcohol if that's the law already? Is this just to make sure nobody tries to be cute on this or was there a particular reason why?

[Speaker 1] (50:29 - 50:33)
Alderman Martin, you want to respond? About the alcohol prohibition.

[Speaker 10] (50:34 - 50:50)
Yes. So if I understand your question, you're saying if people need a license to a packaged goods license, period. Why are we saying that we don't?

I guess I'm still not 100% following your point.

[Speaker 5] (50:51 - 51:06)
Exemption A, if I may, Chairman. Establishments holding a valid liquor license that is subject to the provisions of section 460.071. They are, in fact, allowed to sell alcohol through a walk-up window. Correct?

They're not.

[Speaker 1] (51:07 - 51:15)
You cannot sell alcohol through a window if this ordinance passed, whether or not you have a liquor license or not, except for the exemptions that were listed.

[Speaker 5] (51:15 - 51:31)
But this says provided, however, this requirement shall not apply to establishments holding a valid liquor license. So I want to make sure that I'm under I'm reading this to say that you can have one have a liquor license and sell because you are exempt by this ordinance. Am I misunderstanding?

[Speaker 1] (51:31 - 51:35)
And sell through the window. But we have law here, too, right? Or me?

[Speaker 12] (51:37 - 52:06)
Yeah. So I can give a first shot. Again, Max from BACP.

Alderman, those those specific exemptions are specific to specific liquor license types. So when you're reading establishments holding a valid liquor license, the second part of that is specifically subject to provisions of section 460.071, which is a Navy peer license. The next exemption is for lakefront liquor licenses.

So it's that it's not a general exemption. They're exempting specific types of liquor licenses.

[Speaker 5] (52:08 - 52:24)
Chairman, can we have someone from the law department explain that? Because I think it's critical when the state of Illinois to refresh everyone's memory in 20 June of 2020 signed a bill saying that you could have cocktails to go. So I'm just trying to understand.

[Speaker 1] (52:24 - 52:29)
Are we I get I get your comparison. You identify yourself for the record, please.

[Speaker 20] (52:38 - 53:07)
Hi, this is Christopher Cold, assistant corporation counsel in the Department of Law to Max's point. He is correct. So the three provisions or four provisions rather are for the Navy peer liquor license, lakefront venue liquor license, Riverwalk venue liquor license and licenses associated with a valid sidewalk cafe permit.

Outside of those licenses, you would not be able to sell liquor through a walk up window.

[Speaker 5] (53:08 - 53:09)
There were four.

[Speaker 20] (53:10 - 53:13)
I apologize. The four or three licenses and one permit.

[Speaker 1] (53:14 - 53:33)
So I think the question was, since Illinois passed cocktails to go. Where is the distinction about through the window? And this would be prohibited through the window.

They could still get a cocktail to go, but they would have to go into the premise and pick up and take it out.

[Speaker 10] (53:34 - 53:53)
That's the way I read it. That's my understanding as well. So you can walk into the food establishment, pick up food or food and liquor and then walk back out through the door.

But you could not pick up liquor just through the walk up window, unless you fall into one of these exceptions.

[Speaker 5] (53:54 - 54:31)
Right. I, I a hundred percent agree. Which is, which is why perhaps if I said this out loud, someone could point out where I'm misunderstanding because number two says no person shall sell alcohol, alcoholic liquor.

As the term is defined in section, whatever from a walk up service window, directly accessible from the public provided, however, that this requirement shall not apply to establishments holding a valid liquor license. So if you have a valid liquor license, you can go through the window.

[Speaker 1] (54:31 - 54:46)
I think you're only reading half of that. You respond to that because these people under the exceptions have a valid liquor license and they will be allowed to do the walk up, you know, so then you can do it.

[Speaker 5] (54:46 - 54:47)
So then you can do it through the window.

[Speaker 1] (54:47 - 54:57)
If they have, if they're in the four exemptions, they have a valid liquor license. They will be able to operate through a so-called window, a window off the public way.

[Speaker 20] (54:58 - 55:17)
Alderman, if I can interject. So to Alderman or Chairman Tunney's point in that sub a, where it says establishments holding a valid liquor license, the qualifier, which states that that is subject to the revisions of section four 6071 should be read to say the Navy Pier liquor license. That is what that section is.

[Speaker 5] (55:18 - 55:33)
So point a is supposed to be the Navy Pier. Yes. So only the Navy Pier.

So right now, if I'm understanding that typo that's missing, actually grants it for all liquor license in Chicago where we should actually put in Navy Piers liquor license.

[Speaker 20] (55:34 - 55:43)
No, because the Navy Pier liquor license, this is the phrasing that we use in the code. There is no Navy Pier liquor license. It's a liquor license subject to the provision.

[Speaker 5] (55:43 - 55:49)
So then four dash 60 dash zero seven one is specifically and solely Navy Pier. That's correct. Got it.

[Speaker 1] (55:50 - 57:06)
Understood. Thank you. All right.

Other questions, comments. Can you get, if not, can I, Alderman Raymond Lopez moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. All those in favor.

And we are going to mark David more as a, a negative on that issue. And we'll report this out tomorrow. This item will be passed as amended since we did have a substitute on it.

All right. Next. Well, thank you.

Well, congratulations, man. You've got a little bit of work to do because I, I do sense a concern in certain communities about dramatically reducing their ability to serve their community and just through the window. Right, David, that's all right.

So we are now on to the landmark, right? Okay. Next we have one historical landmark designation document number zero two zero two three dash five eight in the 26th ward for the pioneer arcade, located at 1535 North Velaskey.

We have Candlin Han here to present the matter. Good morning.

[Speaker 8] (57:08 - 59:40)
Thank you. My name is Candlin Han. I'm a project coordinator with the department of planning and development.

Thank you for having me here this morning. So on December 8th, 2022, the commission on Chicago landmarks voted to recommend landmark designation of the pioneer arcade at 1535 North Velaskey road to city council 26th ward alderman Robert Roberto Maldonado is in support of the designation. The pioneer arcade is located just South of the intersection of North and Pulaski road in the humble park community area.

The commission found that the pioneer arcade met two criteria for designation. It's value is an example of Chicago's heritage and its architectural significance. Entrepreneurs had begun creating these new recreation centers in neighborhood commercial districts after prohibition shut down the saloons where the games had been played.

New locations were needed because America's working class had more money and more free time than any generation preceding it. From its opening in 1925, the pioneer arcade thrived as a bowling alley and billiard hall, regularly hosting private and employer sponsored league tournaments and citywide competitions. Also by this time, Chicago had become the Midwestern center for the growing national indoor sports of bowling and billiards.

As early as 1901, Chicago had hosted the first nationwide modern bowling tournament. In 1916, Chicago had held one of the first billiard world championship games. And by the 1930s, Chicago was a center for exhibitions and tournaments and home to nationally recognized players who could be found practicing their craft at recreation centers throughout the city like the pioneer arcade.

Recreation centers also took on the role of de facto neighborhood social hall. It was a welcoming, safe and inexpensive evening and weekend entertainment for Chicagoans of almost every income, ethnicity, age, or gender. The pioneer arcade is also one of Chicago's grandest urban sports halls surviving from the 1920s.

The richly decorated terra cotta facade imparts the feel of an exotic Spanish palace. It's Spanish Baroque revival architectural style with exuberant ornamentation incorporating classical elements was most popular in the 1920s and 30s, particularly for large movie palaces like the Uptown Theater and other entertainment architecture, such as the Aragon Ballroom.

[Speaker 25] (59:45 - 59:48)
So again, Alderman Roberto Maldonado is in support of the designation.

[Speaker 8] (59:49 - 59:52)
And please let me know if you have any questions. Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (59:52 - 1:00:03)
All right. Thank you, Candlin. Questions by committee members.

One quick one. You only said two of, was it seven criterion?

[Speaker 25] (1:00:03 - 1:00:04)
Exactly. Yeah.

[Speaker 1] (1:00:04 - 1:00:05)
Why only two?

[Speaker 8] (1:00:07 - 1:00:22)
We just analyze against the other seven. It isn't, you know, it isn't associated with a person. It isn't thematic location.

So it only rose to meet those two, but that's the minimum requirement and it met that requirement. So that's all it needed to meet.

[Speaker 1] (1:00:22 - 1:00:30)
Well, it does obviously the way you, your testimony provide a lot of historical context and, and safe places for people to.

[Speaker 8] (1:00:30 - 1:00:30)
Yeah.

[Speaker 1] (1:00:31 - 1:00:31)
Recreate.

[Speaker 8] (1:00:31 - 1:00:42)
Yeah. And those were throughout the city. So it's, it's really amazing that this is still around and it it's around because it functioned as a bowling alley and a billiard hall through.

[Speaker 1] (1:00:43 - 1:00:47)
And I hope, and I, I understand that there's an adaptive reuse of this program.

[Speaker 8] (1:00:47 - 1:00:47)
Yeah. Yeah.

[Speaker 1] (1:00:47 - 1:01:02)
And this works with it to make that Alderman Kaplan might want to say we've been, we've been hoping the uptown a much bigger venue would have some adaptive reuse while maintaining the important elements of it. Thank you. Alderman.

[Speaker 16] (1:01:03 - 1:01:43)
Chairman. I want to thank the folks that move this forward because this is truly a landmark. I can tell you stories about the second floor Friday nights when we were bowling, but I, you're that old, right?

Well, I said 30s or what Friday nights was a good night at the bowling alley. And then downstairs, if I'm not mistaken, this is part of a movie that was filmed there with Jackie Gleason, or Paul Newman, or something like that. Minnesota fats, maybe if I'm not mistaken, but it's a beautiful building.

It should be landmark. I certainly agree with that. So this is an excellent choice.

[Speaker 1] (1:01:44 - 1:02:00)
Right. Any other comments, questions. If not Alderman, a real boy, as moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum, any objections hearing on this order is passed.

Congratulations.

[Speaker 25] (1:02:00 - 1:02:01)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:02:02 - 1:03:19)
Okay. All right. Next up on the addendum, our large signs over 100 square feet in area, 24 feet above grade.

We'll hear them all together. I'll read the board followed by the address and take a motion at the end. In the second war, 26 West division street, third ward, 3301 South Michigan Avenue.

In the 26th ward, 3450 West division Avenue or division street. Division street, 46th ward, 46, 11 North Broadway, two signs also in the 46th ward located at 3501 North Paul stood. And lastly, two signs in the 47th ward located at 4701 North Raven, Raven would Raven's would Avenue questions by committee members.

Alderman Hopkins makes a motion move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections hearing on the orders are passed. We'll now move on to the regular agenda.

In an effort to ensure the committee meeting runs as smoothly as possible. The typical order in which the items will be heard has been updated. Items will be grouped together according to witness attorney and will be heard in that order rather than in the traditional ward order.

All right. And we have Nicole joining me.

[Speaker 2] (1:03:21 - 1:03:22)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (1:03:24 - 1:03:53)
So page one, document number two, two zero nine two. In the first ward ordinance was reverted referred on February 1st of 2023. And the common address is 2175 North Milwaukee Avenue change request from an RS three residential single unit detached house district to an RM 4.5 residential multi-unit district. We have Rolando Acosta on the item in the first ward.

[Speaker 6] (1:03:53 - 1:04:37)
Good morning. Excuse me. Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant. This matter involves a, a parcel of property in about third 3000 square foot that currently has two dwelling units in the front building. It has a coach house in the rear for one with one dwelling unit. There is a basement in the front building that is unoccupied unimproved.

The owner wishes to improve that basement by adding a unit to it. Hence the reason for the rezoning from the RS three to the RM 4.5. We did have a community meeting on this matter. The community was favorably disposed.

And as a result, we have secured a letter of support from Alderman La Spada. Happy to answer any questions the committee may have.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:38 - 1:04:40)
And it's not in an ADU area. Ergo.

[Speaker 6] (1:04:41 - 1:04:45)
Well, I think it's, it isn't an ADU, but couldn't qualify because of the existing coach house.

[Speaker 2] (1:04:45 - 1:04:55)
If I remember correctly. Zoning. Yeah.

Okay. It did go to a type one. Oh, I'm sorry.

I don't.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:56 - 1:05:14)
Okay. So first. I don't know about the coach Alderman.

Okay. uh, where boy is moves to amend the application to a type one. Application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections. No objections. So it is now amended to a type one.

[Speaker 26] (1:05:14 - 1:05:14)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:05:15 - 1:05:17)
Again, the narrative is the same.

[Speaker 6] (1:05:17 - 1:05:23)
The narrative is actually, it's a brand new narrative because we, we started with just a regular rezoning. And amended it.

[Speaker 1] (1:05:24 - 1:05:24)
Explanation.

[Speaker 6] (1:05:24 - 1:05:26)
Oh, the explanation. Yes, it's the same. Okay.

[Speaker 2] (1:05:26 - 1:05:32)
Chairman. Okay. Questions.

[Speaker 1] (1:05:35 - 1:05:50)
Hearing none. all have been rebellious. Our moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Objections. No objections. This is passed as a type one.

[Speaker 26] (1:05:50 - 1:05:50)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:05:51 - 1:06:16)
All right. Bottom of page one, document number two, two, zero, nine, four T one. In the first ward ordinance was referred on February 1st of 2023.

This address not too far away is 1416 North Maplewood, and the change request from an RS three residential single unit detached house district to be two, three neighborhood mixed use district. Rolando Acosta.

[Speaker 6] (1:06:16 - 1:07:28)
Good morning again, Mr chairman members of the committee Rolando Acosta on behalf of the applicant. This is approximately seven blocks south of the last matter. Also in the first ward, this was subject of a multiple community meetings originally started with a proposal to demolish the existing structure and build a new structure on site.

The community objected to that proposal. So the plan has been modified to keep the two floors of the existing, it's existing three story building pitch through for the upper floor, keep the lower floors, keep those just to preserve that context, but add the space above and add one unit to the property. So we currently have three units on the property, seeking to add a fourth unit to the property, as well as the additional space in what would be the two upper floors.

That would be new construction. There's also no parking currently on the property and the proposal would add three parking spaces to the property at the rear alley. Again, after all of those community meetings and with the revised proposal, we've secured the support of Alderman LaSpada and he submitted a letter to that effect.

Happy to answer any questions the committee may have.

[Speaker 1] (1:07:29 - 1:08:15)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman LaSpada. Questions, comments? Hearing none.

Alderman Roboius moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Objections? Hearing none.

This item is passed. Moving on to page two. Document number 22093 T1 in the 30th ward.

Ordinance was referred on February 1st of 2023. Common address is 3248 through 56 North Pulaski road. Also 4001 through 4011 West school street.

And the change request from B3 to community shopping district to be to five neighborhood mixed use district. Rolando Acosta on the application.

[Speaker 6] (1:08:16 - 1:09:14)
Once again, Rolando Acosta. Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee here on behalf of Rolando Acosta on behalf of the applicant. This is a three-story building currently has commercial space along Pulaski.

It also has commercial space along school. It's on the corner. It's an L shaped building on the upper floors.

It contains 33 dwelling units. Mostly in studio form. The commercial space on Pulaski has been regularly leased throughout the time period, but the commercial space on school street, as that is a side street, it's really a residential street has been vacant for over three years.

The owners proposed to convert that commercial space on the ground floor at the five dwelling units. These would be one bedroom so that we don't increase the number of studios on the property. We have presented this proposal to vice chairman who is supportive of the proposal, but I know he's here and can speak on his own behalf.

[Speaker 1] (1:09:15 - 1:09:17)
Thank you. Rolando vice chair.

[Speaker 16] (1:09:17 - 1:09:35)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yeah, I'm in full support of this matter before you. Those units have been vacant for a number of years.

Nothing's changed on the building. We were just adding additional rental units. So I there, I asked for a favorable support on the matter before you.

[Speaker 1] (1:09:37 - 1:09:43)
Two quick questions. Rolando. What five you one bedrooms.

[Speaker 6] (1:09:43 - 1:09:44)
What is five one bedrooms?

[Speaker 1] (1:09:44 - 1:09:51)
Yes, five one bedrooms. So what was previously commercial space? What's the square footage of the commercial space that will now be residential.

[Speaker 6] (1:09:52 - 1:09:57)
Oh, I think it's about five to 6,000 square feet. It's significant.

[Speaker 1] (1:09:57 - 1:10:02)
And then, like we always ask, is there any, any parking at this thing?

[Speaker 6] (1:10:02 - 1:10:14)
There's a couple of parking spaces at the rear, but really none can be added because the building pretty much occupies the site. This is a transit oriented location. So we are taking advantage of that.

[Speaker 1] (1:10:14 - 1:10:59)
Other questions, comments. Hearing none Alderman Hopkins moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections.

Hearing none. The item is passed. Moving to the middle of page.

Thank you. In the second ward document number two to zero nine one. The ordinance was referred on February 1 of 2023.

This common address 1617 North Wells Street, and the change request from B one three neighborhood shopping district to be three three community shopping district, Sarah Barnes. Even though you only have one application I'm going to ask you to be brief.

[Speaker 2] (1:10:59 - 1:10:59)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:11:01 - 1:11:05)
A little discretion. And the sunset of my career.

[Speaker 13] (1:11:07 - 1:11:09)
Timer. All right.

[Speaker 1] (1:11:09 - 1:11:10)
Good morning.

[Speaker 13] (1:11:10 - 1:13:22)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and. Team members of the committee for the record. My name is Sarah Barnes.

And I'm an attorney with the lobsters of Sam banks. Happy to be here this. Morning on behalf of the applicant.

And for all of those of you that are. Familiar with old town, maybe used to go to second city or zanies. This is the old wells on wells.

Property. It was a. Bar splash.

Or bar that serves food. We'll put it that way. They abandoned the site in 2020.

The site was abandoned in January, 2021. I made the COVID shut down and the. First floor of the building has remained vacant.

There were some other operators that were interested in going in there, but they were not as well received by the community. I will commend Alderman Hopkins for having a very robust community review process to get in the right operator. So incomes.

My client who owns the adjacent property, that's also a restaurant. Corcoran's. They would like to reconcept the first floor of the subject property with a new restaurant.

That will it's a general restaurant, so they will serve alcohol, but it won't be a bar with food. It's going to be a nicer upscale casual restaurant. We did again, have a very robust community review period.

We met with the old time. Triangles association who has issued a letter of support for the proposal. We've received a lot of excitement from people who live in the neighborhood for having a restaurant.

And so I think we were generally met with support from the community. Alderman can probably speak to that effect as well. So we are just here respectfully requesting.

The committee's approval for this project. The reason we need it is for the use. The property was rezoned.

Down zoned to a B one. In order to maintain some control over again, operations. So we do need to get it back into a zoning classification that allows for a general restaurant.

[Speaker 23] (1:13:22 - 1:14:04)
Thank you, Sarah. Alderman Hopkins. Oh, yeah.

Thank you. Mr. Chairman, just to add to this Barnes. And the history of the property in the rear of the property on the patio was used by Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi during their filming and the blues brothers here in 1980, that was their, their private playground, so to speak.

So there's a lot of history there connected to the film and entertainment industry in Chicago. The operator of the building next door has been a responsible operator. Excellent relations with the neighborhood, which is why I'm able to stand in full support of this zoning change and the plans for this property going forward.

I'd ask for an aye vote. Thank you Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (1:14:05 - 1:14:20)
So Corcoran's is going to be running both establishments. All right. Other questions, comments.

Hearing none Alderman. Brendan Riley moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections.

Hearing none. The item is passed. Good luck.

[Speaker 13] (1:14:20 - 1:14:21)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:14:21 - 1:14:46)
All right, bottom of page to document number two to 096 in the fifth board ordinance was referred on February 1 of 2023, and the common address 1650 East 71st Street change request from C to to motor vehicle related commercial district and our T for residential to flat townhouse and multi unit district, all to a C to to motor vehicle related commercial district.

[Speaker 2] (1:14:48 - 1:15:05)
Scott Kennelly. Morning, sir. Good morning.

How are you?

[Speaker 22] (1:15:06 - 1:15:46)
Identify yourself for the record and proceed. My name is Scott Kennelly. I'm with you all corporation.

You haul. Yes. So you haul is operated out of the facility since 1978.

And it's been under split zoning since that time. So you haul intends to unify the split zones under a single zone of C2 dash two, in order to obtain a building permit to add two additional floors to the current building. Each new additional floor.

We'll have a floor area of 26,169 square feet. The building will have a new height of 50 foot and increase the total floor area to be in compliance with the zoning requirements of the news C2 dash two zone.

[Speaker 1] (1:15:48 - 1:16:01)
All right. Thank you, Scott. So it's an existing facility.

Yes. With split zoning. Yes.

But this all is here because you're adding on to this facility. Yeah. It sounds like almost doubling in size.

[Speaker 22] (1:16:01 - 1:16:10)
It is. That is correct. We wanted to add two floors to it, but it's currently five foot onto an RT four.

Right. So that's what's holding up the building permit.

[Speaker 1] (1:16:12 - 1:16:36)
Questions. Other comments department. No problem.

No, it's no problem. All right. And we do have a letter of support from all the woman Hairston.

Yes. You know, the questions comments. Hearing on Alderman seat, your Lopez moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections hearing on the item is passed. Good luck. Thank you very much for continuing to invest in our city.

[Speaker 2] (1:16:37 - 1:16:45)
All right. Oh, okay. All right.

So we're on the top of page three.

[Speaker 1] (1:16:47 - 1:17:11)
We have document number two to zero nine five in the 10th ward ordinance was referred on February 1st of 2023. Common address is one Oh three five eight South Ewing Avenue. The change request from an RS three residential single unit detached house district would be to one neighborhood mixed use district.

And we have Victor. Sir. Good morning, sir.

[Speaker 21] (1:17:12 - 1:18:12)
Good morning to you all. So what we have here in our neighborhood on the Southeast side is it's a building that has an apartment in the rear of business on the storefront Ewing Avenue. Ewing Avenue is a main thoroughfare it's almost like the main vein of the neighborhood.

The building is right across the street from Galista language Academy. Maybe 30 years ago used to be a small candy store. It's been vacant ever since we are looking to.

It was it's a residential building. It's zoned as residential looking to have it zoned as commercial so that we can put a coffee shop there because the community we're seeing more vacant storefronts on Ewing. The Catholic church and archdiocese is close three churches.

We're losing everything. And this is a community gathering center, but we see families crossing the street every day. There's crossing guards on this area.

And so this is a perfect gathering place for the community. It's a healthy wholesome business. The alderman supports this in the area.

We've got vast feedback from everyone in the community. There's no complaints. Everyone is in support of this.

[Speaker 1] (1:18:12 - 1:19:04)
So we ask that it be zoned for your testimony is is concurrent with enthusiastic support from older woman Garza. Any questions, comments. Alderman David Moore moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine form.

Objections. Hearing none. The item is passed.

Good luck to you. Thank you. Okay.

So do I need to read it back in. Okay. Middle of page three, document number two to zero nine eight in the 17th ward ordinance was referred on February 1st of 2023.

This common address is 3055 West 63rd Street, and the change request from B one one neighborhood shopping district to see one one neighborhood commercial district. We have Renee Hatcher. Good morning.

[Speaker 14] (1:19:04 - 1:19:16)
My name is Renee Hatcher. For the record, I am a assistant professor at UIC law where I direct a clinic called the community enterprise and solidarity economy clinic, we represent that again.

[Speaker 1] (1:19:17 - 1:19:20)
Another one is a little too fast for me.

[Speaker 14] (1:19:20 - 1:20:39)
I direct the clinic at UIC law, and we essentially provide representation pro bono for community based businesses and nonprofits in Chicago. It's called the community enterprise and solidarity economy clinic. It's a very long name, but that more or less is are the businesses that we actually represent.

So I'm here on behalf of one of our clients, blue 10 production, which is a woman own worker co op in the city of Chicago, and specifically requesting a change from a B one neighborhood shopping district to a C one neighborhood commercial district at 3055 West 63rd Street. This building, many years ago was a Salvation Army thrift store. It's been vacant, a number of years before it was purchased by my client.

And ultimately my client is requesting the change in part to refit the building into a community center that will also provide commercial offices to both nonprofits and for profits, as well as some additional uses of space for community groups, and to continue the small sewing factory that will be used both for commercial and community purposes. I'm happy to answer any questions about the application.

[Speaker 1] (1:20:40 - 1:20:43)
Alderman David Moore would like to comment on.

[Speaker 3] (1:20:43 - 1:21:55)
Yes, thank you, Chairman. We've been working on this only with them but the community organizations within the board and I forget the name of the grant that was awarded Do you remember from the city, and how much was that. The, the applicant did receive several million dollars from the city I'm not exactly sure what program that was through but that was in support of this project was one of the mayor's development recovery programs I just don't have it in front of me but they've worked closely with my office and the young people which I'm excited about.

That's what I'm excited about is the number of young people in the community that's involved in this so there's definitely something I support, and definitely would love the federal consideration I actually used to shop at that thrift store, and it closed in around 2016, and I've been trying to look for someone to go in there first we supposed to get have gotten a baker to go there then something happened and it didn't go well. And so to have this community center to come along with their working with greater Southwest Development Corporation, as well because along that strip we got so many vacant stores there, this will help hopefully jumpstart some activity there.

[Speaker 1] (1:21:55 - 1:22:00)
Great. Sounds exciting. What is the square footage of this.

[Speaker 14] (1:22:00 - 1:22:16)
The total square footage is just one second. It's roughly 11,000 square feet. Exactly 11,126 square feet.

The footprint of the building will not change.

[Speaker 1] (1:22:17 - 1:23:18)
Well, it's great. All I can say you know it just reminds a little bit of whole house that used to be on the north side where they had obviously community activities and they also had a pottery, you know they had pottery classes and stuff like that so when you talk about the sewing and stuff it just kind of reminded me of what you know, we have seen on the north side, so good luck to you. Thank you.

Any other questions comments. All the vice chair rebellious moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections.

Hearing none. This item is passed and we reported out tomorrow. Good luck to you.

All right, bottom page three document number two to 097 t one in the 19th ward, the ordinance was referred on February 1 of 2023, the address. 10019 Southwestern Avenue, and the change request from be one one neighborhood shopping district to see one one neighborhood commercial district. We have Bruce Jackson.

Good morning, sir.

[Speaker 17] (1:23:18 - 1:24:38)
Good morning Mr Chairman to you and the committee. For the record, my name is Bruce Jackson here on behalf of the applicant and owner, Griffin barres holding LLC Western series. This property is located at 119 Southwestern Avenue, and is currently zoned be one one.

We are seeking to amend the zoning from be one one to see one one. This zoning change will permit the applicant owner to renovate the property for use as a commercial shared kitchen, with the sole purpose of commercial kitchen rental. Prior to the pandemic, this property was used by the applicant owner as an orthodontist dentist office that was closed as a result of the pandemic.

But during the pandemic, the applicant owner met with food service professionals who advised that there was no commercial shared facilities on the south side either in Beverly or Morgan Park. The only shared kitchen space being on the north and west sides. So this amendment will permit the development of a shared kitchen space with for preparation stations, a tasting room reception and waiting room.

We are unaware of any objections to the application, and we have the support of the alderman, and the advisory committee.

[Speaker 1] (1:24:39 - 1:25:27)
Thank you, Bruce we do have a letter of support from Alderman O'Shea questions comments. Hearing on Alderman Cetra Lopez moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. The objections hearing on the items past.

Good luck to you because there's a from a dentist office to a shared kitchen is no cheap date. And, you know, we've seen, you know, on the north side we had a, we had a place open on a formerly a restaurant, and didn't let it didn't last. So, kind of, I know it's a big risk, I know, you know, getting restaurants hooked up to these things and, you know, and then there's a whole licensing thing but it's just, you know, it's something that obviously piques my interest.

[Speaker 17] (1:25:27 - 1:25:33)
You would know when I'm listening. Because the plans are quite extensive. So, thank you.

All right.

[Speaker 1] (1:25:33 - 1:26:05)
Good luck to you. All right, top page for. We have document number 21094 in the 26th ward ordinance was referred on July 20 of 2022.

The common address is 2429 West Superior Street, and the change request from an RS three residential singing unit detached house district to an RM 4.5 residential multi unit district. And we have Matt Ali in this item. Good morning, Matt.

[Speaker 18] (1:26:06 - 1:27:28)
Good morning. Thank you, Chairman, and good morning members of the committee. For the record, my name is Matthew Ali and attorney with the law firm of Aikerman LLP, on behalf of the applicant, Jennifer Cushman, the applicant purchased the property located at 2429 West Superior Street in August, 2021, which at that time was improved with a two story with unfinished basement residential building with two dwelling units, and two off street parking spaces.

The applicant purchased the property for it to become the residence for herself and her sister. The properties currently zoned RS three, and the ordinance before the committee proposes to change the property zoning designation to RM 4.5. This zoning change will allow for the renovation of the existing unfinished basement for conversion into a third dwelling unit at the property. This third dwelling is being developed for the applicants aging mother, which will allow for the applicant and her sister to provide both assistance and autonomy for their mother at the property.

Specifically the proposed RM 4.5 zoning allows for the property to conform with the minimum area per dwelling unit standard of the Chicago zoning ordinance. Prior to filing this application, the project team worked closely with Alderman Maldonado's office, who has provided a letter of support for this zoning change application, and which has been shared with the committee for your reference. We now request this committee's favorable consideration of this matter, and would welcome any questions or comments from committee members.

[Speaker 1] (1:27:29 - 1:28:19)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Maldonado questions comments. Hearing none. Vice Chair voice moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections. Very none the item is passed. Thank you.

Let's see, is this our last item. All right, document number 22099 T one in the 30th ward ordinance was referred on February 1 of 2023 common address 3254 North Kilbourne Avenue, and the change request from M one one limited manufacturing business park district to an RS three residential single unit detached house district, and we have Katie janky Dale on this application in the 30th ward.

[Speaker 19] (1:28:19 - 1:29:30)
Thank you. Good morning Mr chairman and members of the committee for the record Katie janky Dale from the law firm of DLA Piper at four four four Westlake. We represent the applicant intrinsic schools, joined today also by Melissa's a ghost, who is the CEO and co founder of intrinsic the properties located at the southwest corner of school in Kilbourne and currently occupied by service master.

Once service masters relocated the applicant proposes to adaptively reuse the building to accommodate its existing staff and students from the nearby campus located at 4540 West Belmont. There's a substitute ordinance for this matter as we changed the requested zoning from what we filed with at the RS three to an RM five. This change resulted from a meeting with CDOT and DPD that was facilitated by Alderman where is related to a streetscape project proposed for school street.

The new zoning request will allow the site to be eligible for transit serve location parking reductions that may be needed in the future to accommodate that streetscape project on this side of the street. The building height and other metrics would all remain the same. The project team worked very closely with CDOT DPD and Alderman where is in connection with this request, I know the ultimate is here today, but we're available for any questions you may have.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

[Speaker 1] (1:29:31 - 1:30:18)
Thank you, Katie, Vice Chair rebellious substitute German. Oh, okay, we've got to do a couple things right. Okay, so Katie, first of all, we're going to Alderman CJO Lopez moves to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections, hearing on the substitute is before us. And since it is a type one is it right. Okay, so then Alderman CJO Lopez moves to accept the substantive narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections to that. Okay, so now we have the substantive narrative plans are accepted. Vice Chair rebellious tell us a little bit about this.

[Speaker 16] (1:30:19 - 1:31:03)
Well, exciting project building used to be the home of ESCO lighting that did a lot of lighting work for the city of Chicago, especially at O'Hare aviation. But since then, we have service master there we're hoping that intrinsic can acquire the building. This, the intrinsic schools are very well established premier school in the city of Chicago, especially in the northwest side.

They're seeking some space to move students to a more suitable setting on a classroom size. There's no development going on no destruction, just move right in. I asked for a favorable vote on the matter before you Mr chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:31:03 - 1:32:12)
Thank you, Alderman obviously we have strong support for the project. My, my question, what's happening with service master I know it's not a zoning issue but they're looking for a location in the city. That's correct.

Make sure that that was noted. Intrinsic and its brokers are working to actually tell them try to relocate and find a new building, we do have a robust Department of Planning that's about retaining businesses okay in our city. It's a paramount issue for me but it's not zoning related.

All right, any other questions comments. Hearing none. Alderman CTO Lopez moves to pass as amended, and with the substitute narrative and plans.

Any objections. Hearing none. The item is passed.

Follows exactly. Revise revised. All right.
