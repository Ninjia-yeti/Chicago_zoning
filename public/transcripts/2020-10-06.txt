[Speaker 7] (6:05 - 8:40)
Good morning, everybody.

[Speaker 19] (8:42 - 8:45)
Good morning, everybody. Good morning, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (8:46 - 9:56)
Happy Tuesday. Everybody got their seat belts on. We're going to have a fairly long meeting.

FYI, we're going to do appointments, text amendments, and landmark and signs, hopefully, between the hours of 10 and noon. And then subsequent to that, we'll reconvene at noon for the private applications. This is, in my humble opinion, trying to minimize the cost for attorneys being on the line for six hours when they have a private application in one ward.

So that's my theory. Hopefully it works. All right.

The October 6th, 2020 Committee on Zoning, Landmarks, and Building Standards is called to order. All right. Pursuant to applicable law, the chairman has determined that an in-person meeting is not practical or prudent.

Accordingly, attendance at this meeting will be by remote means only. We will start off with a roll call. Committee members, please unmute yourself.

Alderman Hopkins.

[Speaker 30] (10:00 - 10:09)
Alderman Hopkins, present. And Mr. Chairman, at the conclusion of the roll call, if you could please repeat your intention regarding the sequence of events on the agenda. Thank you.

I'm going to repeat the order of events this morning. We will have appointments, text amendments, and signs, and a landmark application between the hours of 10 and noon. We will hopefully be able to take a short break.

Noon we will start private applications in the effort to try to minimize the amount of time lawyers are on while we're discussing more macro issues. Alderman Hopkins, you heard that now?

[Speaker 30] (12:07 - 12:08)
Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (12:09 - 12:40)
Okay, all right. We're going to start this morning off with the approval of the Rule 45 report containing the minutes of the September Committee on Zoning, Landmark, and Building Standards hearing.

[Speaker 1] (21:19 - 21:21)
Welcome, Zach. You have your three minutes, sir.

[Speaker 31] (21:22 - 24:18)
Thank you. My statement is in regards to the proposed rezoning application at 3501 North Halstead to upzone from a C-1-2 to a C-1-5 designation. As a result of this application, I've become more aware of the Chicago Code of Ordinances, particularly Sections 17-13-0308A-E, which details the review and approval procedures for rezoning.

As you know, these legal criteria ask the Council to assess whether the zoning designation is consistent with any plans in the area already approved by City Council, whether it fits the character of the neighborhood in terms of size, density, height, and building scale, and whether it is compatible with the surrounding zoning designations, which in this particular case is C-1-2 and C-1-3 only. The answer is clear. The C-1-5 zoning designation must be rejected.

I also have to express my disappointment and regret in how the City has handled this application. Like my fellow neighbors and condo HOAs, I have expressed concern over the rezoning request through letters to the aldermen and at community meetings. My concern is that the C-1-5 zoning designation does not conform to the surrounding community as described in the aforementioned Sections 0308A-E.

My letters were ignored and hidden, despite being told by the aldermen that written letters would be read at community meetings. The motive for hiding criticism was evident when the alderman described his 30-year friendships with David Munar, the CEO of Howard Brown, and the applicant, raising the question of a conflict of interest. When my fellow neighbors and I expressed concern during community meetings about zoning conformity, we were ignored, silenced, ridiculed, accosted, and often verbally abused by the alderman and his Chief of Staff.

I have never experienced firsthand such slanderous behavior from an elected official's office. Not only is it unprofessional, disrespectful, and disappointing, but also embarrassing and borders on harassment. The City should not tolerate behavior of this magnitude.

But today, your decision is clear. Reject the C-1-5 zoning application based on the legal criteria set forth in the City's review protocol. However, you can offer a C-1-3 zone, which does conform to the neighborhood.

And the FAR allowed by C-1-3 permits a maximum of approximately 54,000 square feet in this specific lot, which is larger than the space allocated for all health care services, including administrative offices, social services, pharmacies, primary care clinics, dental practice, behavioral health, psychiatry, and walk-in sexual and reproductive health combined. The only compromise the developer has to make is to repurpose the 15,000 square feet of retail and open atrium unusable space. No compromise has to be made with respect to health care services.

Everyone wins. Why even entertain anything else? I yield the rest of my time.

Thank you for the opportunity to speak.

[Speaker 1] (24:20 - 24:34)
Our next speaker is Joshua Wilmoth. Joshua is not here. Joshua not here.

All right. Justin Erb.

[Speaker 59] (24:39 - 24:40)
Yes, Justin is here.

[Speaker 1] (24:41 - 24:42)
Justin.

[Speaker 59] (24:43 - 24:44)
Yes, I'm here.

[Speaker 1] (24:45 - 24:46)
You can proceed, sir.

[Speaker 40] (24:47 - 27:05)
Thank you. Good morning, Alderman, fellow Chicagoans. Thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak in opposition to the proposed ordinance downzoning the lot located at 6001 to 6011 West Lawrence Avenue.

Again, my name is Justin Erb, and I'm here representing the Chicago neoliberals. It is important to remember that what we are talking about today is whether or not we should materially improve the lives of 48 people, many of whom would be veterans. They cannot speak on their own behalf today because they may not be given the opportunity to move to Jefferson Park and become part of that vibrant community.

Just because we don't know who they are and who they could be does not render them imaginary. They are real flesh and blood people who will be affected by your vote today. I believe I'm speaking a very obvious truth when I say that 49 out of the 50 wards understand that this proposed ordinance is quite simply a bad idea that will result in bad outcomes.

Chicago is an absurdly stratified city across both economic and racial boundaries. And that is why our city is shrinking even during this urban revitalization of the last decade. It is very clear to every Chicagoan that to survive and thrive in the future, this pattern of segregation must come to an end and swiftly.

Despite this obvious truth, this ordinance is overwhelmingly likely to pass because of the practice of aldermanic privilege, which is the informal agreement between aldermen to support one another in any zoning change to their own ward, even down to the parcel level, as is the case here. This practice is the reason that Chicago finds itself in its present situation. So if you follow an agreement and it brought us to this, of what use is continuing to follow that agreement?

There is no ordinance, statute or law that is requiring this practice to continue. It could end today. When you were elected to your seat, your constituents had faith that you would take measures to improve not only their lives, but Chicago as a whole.

Today, an opportunity has presented itself to do just that. I urge you all to take it. I yield the remainder of my time.

Thank you for this opportunity.

[Speaker 1] (27:06 - 27:10)
Thank you, Justin. Our next speaker, Linda Hudson.

[Speaker 42] (27:23 - 27:25)
Star six time you please.

[Speaker 1] (27:31 - 27:32)
Linda.

[Speaker 44] (27:32 - 27:34)
Good morning. Good morning.

[Speaker 1] (27:35 - 27:36)
This is Linda Hudson.

[Speaker 44] (27:37 - 27:39)
Yes. Can you hear me. Now we can.

[Speaker 1] (27:39 - 27:40)
Thank you. Let's proceed.

[Speaker 44] (27:41 - 29:35)
I'm calling an opposition of general iron. I have, I live in the eighth ward and I follow the general iron story. I have nothing but respect for the residents of the 10th ward who are working to stop general iron from coming into our neighborhood.

And following this story, I thought we were back in 2011, because that's when the backroom deals were in the making to bring a fecal and sons from Lincoln Park to the eighth wards Burnside community. The residents of Lincoln Park complained about the noise and the pollution coming from a single and while I was the southeast side had the 16th worst polluter in the nation and Alderman Michelle Harris cut deal. And before we knew it, a single with our new neighbor.

Unlike the 10th ward residents, the eighth ward residents did not have a voice. Having a voice in the makeup of the community you live in is all any taxpayer want a single made all of the promises that general iron is now making the new factory will be equipped with the latest technology, technology that will improve pollution. We're going to plant trees are going to put up lights, we're going to be a good neighbor.

There have been several lawsuits because of the structural damage that a single has caused to the homes in our community. There have been explosions, most recently, April 17 2019 when balls of fire was shooting through the air that caused the fire that injured over Terry's home and displaced her family. The Terry family is currently suing a single.

What makes the voices of the Lincoln Park residents trump the voices of black and brown residents on the southeast side. Don't answer that we already know. We are sick and tired of being the dumping ground for everything the rich North black fighters don't want.

Stop general iron, we don't need another polluter on the southeast side. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (29:35 - 29:44)
Our next speaker is Tasha Alexander I understand we've got her back. Tasha.

[Speaker 34] (29:51 - 29:52)
I'm here. Can you hear me.

[Speaker 1] (29:53 - 29:54)
We can proceed.

[Speaker 34] (29:55 - 32:44)
Okay, thank you. Good morning everybody. My name is Tasha Alexander and I am calling to speak about.

I am in favor of the by the hand community workspace and the Austin community, born and raised in Austin. All I've ever wanted to see Austin thrive again my family moved into the Austin community, back in 1977 so we've been pillars in our community for as long as I can remember, with thriving businesses and what used to have thriving businesses now not not so much. And so I am definitely in favor of the community workspace about a hand club for kids is proposing to put together my connection to body hand goes back to even when I started volunteering, I think, back in 2007.

I'm a mother of three kids, and I chose to send my kids to school in the western suburbs, because I felt at that time, all of the schools were closed on the south and west side of Chicago, as well as their own quality schools within my community so I travel daily to send my kids to school and that's how my connection came about by the hand by the hand was trying to put together a charter school was proposing a charter school in the Austin community, and I actually went down and spoke to the Board of Education on their behalf, because I believe in their vision, and how they were trying to help to, to, to bring about needs that need to be fulfilled in Austin, including bringing back schools and healthier healthier communities. So I've also served as black club president 15 be for the CAPS office for the 15 district, but I've just been faithfully serving in our community, and I just believe in the vision about a hand has.

And so I love my job. So I work as the marketing communication managers of about a hand now I started the position of December of last year, and I left my job after 13 years to come and work by the hand, because I believe in their vision that much to help to not only bring it about buildings that are aesthetically pleasing to the eye, but also, they are serving us and bringing about the needs that are there for better schools and better education.

Because children are future. And so I just want to be able to say that I am definitely in favor of the expense the renovation the new project, but by the hand community workspace. I think it's a it's a great it'll be a great addition to the Austin community very creative, as well as basic serving basic needs as as Wi Fi services and having places where people can go to, even if they want to be budding entrepreneurs or just to have coffee, I would love to be able to go and have coffee with my mother, sitting down in a cafe that's in Austin and not having to travel outside of the suburbs. So, and so that's Tasha Alexander and I am definitely in favor of the body and community workspace in the Austin community, it's always a part of the solution. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (32:45 - 32:56)
Thank you, Diane lemus, I think we reconnected with Diane. Diane Can you unmute yourself.

[Speaker 1] (33:06 - 33:10)
All right, let's move on to Kevin Stewart then.

[Speaker 26] (33:14 - 33:19)
Oh yeah. Okay. Kevin I'm unmuted or.

Yes, you can proceed.

[Speaker 43] (33:20 - 33:20)
Yep.

[Speaker 26] (33:20 - 36:30)
Okay, I'm calling about the historic Pilsen landmark district thing. I just wanted to point out that one of the under like what the major underlying cause of gentrification and like real estate speculation and designation as a landmark district would probably most likely fuel more real estate speculation. On top of that, this proposal was really hastily put together under the previous administration.

Like, it was put together between Danny Solis and Rahm Emanuel two figures who are very not well liked in Pilsen in general. And the thing about that is like even the proponents of this proposal are saying that like it requires more time to hammer out. I think they should.

I think it should be voted down, I'm against it. Not only that it's looking at putting like, like in order to get money to like repair your building. It's looking like you have to invest something like one fourth of the property value into it first, which really does make it difficult for like middle class, or like, like a working class homeowners which is like the majority of homeowners in Pilsen.

To be able to make great pairs on your house. That also like would like this this designation would also make it very difficult for struggling businesses, like the pandemic is the pandemic the pandemic it's been bad on everyone. Implementing this very nebulous experimental like proposal.

During this time, I think is, is not only like too risky but like I think like it's it's well understood that the consequences would be largely negative. On top of that, like, you know, there's like, like the primary, like the primary thing that they've been boosting this as a way to stop demolitions and I don't know if it actually does that. And I don't think that, like, one of the other thing like as I was saying earlier, like, gentrification and displacement, like a lot of it has to do with like real estate speculation and there's like a lot of places in Chicago that for the most part look the same but people can't afford to live there anymore and like the case in point obviously it's like Milwaukee Avenue and Wicker Park.

And, yeah, the proposal doesn't fulfill its intended goal. Its proponents aren't even really that like confident about it they don't sound confident about it like heard them talk about it at length at like different meetings. And on top of that, I think that it would just like fuel speculation and make it very difficult for homeowners to be able to repair their homes, as they would have to invest one fourth of their home value in order to, what do you call it, to be able to get money to be able to repair their building.

And then they have to deal with like a whole code of like, you know, putting the right window on there and everything like it would just make things like pretty bad during an already Thank you, Kevin.

[Speaker 1] (36:32 - 36:35)
Your time is up. Next speaker is more you say more you know.

[Speaker 55] (36:39 - 37:44)
Hi, good morning everybody. My name is more says more I know I'm the director of Pilsen Alliance, I want to echo what Kevin was saying, in opposition to the Pilsen landmark on find it very disappointing and very shameful that our community still does not have a voice. After 23 years of Alderman Danny Solis as a zoning chair element on a you now hold his seat.

So, my hope is that you do not follow in his footsteps. Our community has spoken loud and clear against this landmark proposal. So my, my question is, will you call this for a vote will you call the Pilsen landmark for a vote in November.

There was a black club Chicago article that came out yesterday stating that there's a letter written by yourself, that there will be a vote called in November so I wanted to just ask if that's the case. Shall the community know that the vote will be called for this so that we can vote this down, and then we can replace this with something that is community driven. So that's really where we're at.

Definitely want to possibly hear an answer if we can for today so we know what our next steps are. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (37:47 - 38:03)
Our next speaker is Carolina Skolnick Carolina Skolnick star six to unmute or unmute Carolina.

[Speaker 25] (38:09 - 38:12)
You're unmuted now Carolina you can speak.

[Speaker 1] (38:16 - 38:34)
Let's try it again. Carolina Skolnick. You're up.

All right. Well, we have one more speaker. Roger Romanelli Roger Romanelli.

[Speaker 46] (38:34 - 40:17)
Hi, this is Roger Romanelli executive director of Fulton Market Association and Economic Development Agency industrial businesses and property owners are concerned about the planning department's proposed ordinance to reform the city zoning code for manufacturing that's ordinance number 020204590. Yes, our city should set special new regulations for businesses that emit air and noise pollution, and should ensure public oversight in the business licensing process, but DPD his ordinance appears to veer away from this intent and appears to demand onerous new requirements for warehouse and wholesale businesses in M and PMD zoned areas. DPD appears to group all of these businesses together with freight movement businesses, which are actually presenting noise and air quality challenges and require again onerous new requirements for both.

As of today warehouse and wholesale businesses and freight movement businesses are grouped together in the city zoning code. All of them can gain licenses by right. The ordinance being considered appears to change this and require special use variances for warehouse wholesale and freight movement.

Now this is counterproductive for bringing new warehouse and wholesale jobs and tax revenues to our city. Here's a different solution we hope you'll consider on group warehouse and wholesale businesses from freight movement businesses in the city zoning code. Then, regulate these different businesses differently.

And yes, please require special use variances for freight movement businesses. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (40:22 - 40:33)
I don't see I'm going to try one more time with Diane lemus or Carolina skull Nick.

This is Diane lemus and I thank you for your patience this morning.

[Speaker 1] (40:47 - 40:51)
Diane I recognize your voice. Okay, thank you. Proceed.

[Speaker 35] (40:52 - 43:33)
Okay. Good morning. My name is Diane lemus, and I'm a volunteer for Communities United a grassroots food center ground organization that organizes in the neighborhoods of Belmont Craig in Westridge, Austin.

Roseland and Albany Park. Thank you for this opportunity to present a public comment this morning. I'm speaking today to ask your support for the type one zoning reclassification for the property located at 3557 West Lawrence Avenue.

File number 20442. Seeing firsthand cash investors coming in our Albany Park neighborhood and purchasing our foreclosed two to four unit buildings, proceeding to evict the tenants facilitate a gut rehab and convert these properties into luxury luxury rentals or deconvert them into expensive single family mansion type homes that existing tenants could not afford. We lost many of our Communities United families as they were displaced and forced out of the neighborhood that they love.

Another example of our families being displaced is when a cash investor purchased three of our courtyard buildings, displacing over 60 families evicted all the tenants with a 30 day notice, leaving all 60 families searching for affordable housing in Albany Park, so that they would not have to pull their children out of school in the middle of the school year. This developer proceeded to rehab these units and raise the rents to a price that none of the former renters could afford. This is why we need to sell it down development, bring affordable housing back into Albany Park and stop the displacement of families.

Ruth's Communities United worked with sell it down for over three years on this project to create as many affordable units as possible. This development will provide affordable housing for families that are the lower end of the pay scale. It provides two and three bedroom units, family units.

The commercial commercial space will provide a daycare early learning center that will provide childcare at a very low cost to families living in the building, as well as in the community. We had tremendous support for this development at our community meeting. I am asking that the committee vote in favor of this zoning change, so that we can bring affordable housing back into Albany Park, our neighborhood.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (43:34 - 43:45)
Thank you, Diane. I believe that concludes the public commentary portion of the meeting. We have Carolina.

[Speaker 42] (43:45 - 43:45)
Hello.

[Speaker 1] (43:46 - 43:52)
Okay, we have Carolina our last speaker Carolina. Hello. Can you hear me.

Now we can proceed, please.

[Speaker 29] (43:53 - 46:58)
Hi, this is Dr. Caroline school Nick Munoz. I'm a resident of the affected landmark area in Pilsen. I wanted to voice my opposition.

Alderman and older women. I know that sounds like a worthy cause to landmark our area, but it will make homes on affordable and it'll accelerate displacement of Pilsen's longtime residents. I want you to know our neighborhood fiercely rejects the landmark proposal, but we do have a preservation solution in sight.

We have 435 Pilsen property owners right now who have signed affidavits in opposition. 95% of residents in the affected area are opposing landmarking, including myself. And I know the city believes landmarking and Pilsen is going to stop the rampant demolition that happened when a lot of developers came in and built these new multi-unit buildings.

But this is not the right response. And I want to point out the buildings went up because the city sanctioned them and granted demolition permits without accountability to Pilsen residents. The city's response is misguided.

It really needs to reform how we're giving out demolition permits. And ultimately Pilsen residents are going to be penalized, putting the bill of preservation here. This is going to destroy our community.

Pilsen residents cannot afford to maintain landmarked homes, which are extremely cost prohibitive. And the expenses are going to be hard hit by low income homeowners and renters who are going to absorb the passed on costs. Landmarking is so expensive.

It's just not a viable solution for most of our residents. One example, you know, if you need to have a window replaced to meet landmark standards, instead of being able to put in $170 window, you're going to be looking at a $900 to $1,600 window is the estimates that we've been getting. Pilsen residents need housing that's more affordable, not less.

And in the midst of a pandemic that's threatening homeowners' ability to keep their home, passing a law that's going to increase costs and possibly spur foreclosures is unacceptable. The Pilsen landmark incentives are completely unobtainable. Our median income is $37,000.

So having 25% of your home's value to spend on renovation is just not doable in Pilsen. It's not realistic. What this is going to translate into is Pilsen homeowners being unable to afford maintaining their homes.

And then they're going to lose their homes. We have other ways to protect buildings. Our aldermen, Byron Ciccio Lopez collaborated with hundreds of community members to come up with a demolition free district ordinance.

Pilsen residents support this ordinance. And so as of now, the zoning committee and city council, as well as Mayor Lightfoot are ignoring Pilsen's viable community based solution, even though it satisfies all players here. I implore you aldermen and alderwomen, please bring the landmark bill for a vote.

Carry out your duty to secure a democratic process for the 25th Ward constituents. The city is accountable to its citizens.

[Speaker 1] (46:58 - 47:33)
Thank you very much. That concludes our public comment period portion of the meeting. We will start with the addendum to the agenda and with mayoral appointments.

First appointment we'll be discussing is a 2020 dash 101, the appointment of Matt Boudreau as buildings commissioner. I know Matt is on the line and I think you all should know him already. But our resume was enclosed also.

All right. So, Matt.

[Speaker 11] (47:34 - 52:42)
Good morning, Chairman Tony and the honorable members of the committee on zoning landmarks and building standards. My name is Matt Boudreau and I'm the acting commissioner for the Department of Buildings. I'm truly humbled to have been appointed by Mayor Lightfoot to serve as commissioner of one of the best departments in city government.

One that truly serves all 77 communities of our great city. I'm equally humbled to be here before you today seeking your approval of this appointment. I know I have some big shoes to fill for my predecessor and friend, Judy Friedland.

As I share with many of you in the recent months, I feel like Phil Jackson when he took over the Chicago Bulls. All the pieces are in place, not only for DOB to continue its success, but the foundation has been laid to go even further as a department. You have my commitment that DOB will continue to be fair and responsive.

And most importantly, we'll continue to bring common sense solutions to the challenges and opportunities facing our great city today and in the future. When I was appointed, the mayor made it crystal clear that DOB must maintain the stability and high level of service to which it is known. As many of you are aware, in addition to my move to commissioner, Marlene Hopkins, one of the great treasures of city government, who's with me in the room today, was also promoted by Mayor Daley to first deputy commissioner.

Together, it is our goal to have one of the best and diverse executive teams in the city. I'm proud to be the first Native American commissioner in the city, and I am also fully committed to ensuring that DOB staff and leadership reflect all Chicagoans. As DOB first deputy commissioner since 2011, I've had the privilege to work with many of you on several reforms for the department, including improving our process to reduce the time to obtain permits and inspections, rewriting the building code to make construction safer, more cost effective, more flexible, and more innovative.

Bringing investment to all our communities, providing more tools and collaboration to address vacant and troubled buildings in the communities, and addressing bad actors in the construction industry that can often prey on our residents. I've had the privilege to work with many of you over the years in my previous roles as well, with the Department of Public Health, Department of Administrative Hearings, and various state and county agencies. I'm a fifth-generation Chicagoan, and I have a deep love for our city, and stayed here both for college and law school.

My first home was a two-bedroom apartment, which I shared with my parents and six siblings on the corner of California and Logan. My mom was a machinist at Dodge Chicago plant during World War II, and later at the Zena television plant. My dad was a local 134 electrician, and whenever he would drive around the city, he'd point out all the buildings, homes, and businesses where he'd worked over the years.

He was proud that his work generated homes and jobs for people, and he saw that his work was really truly helping people, which stuck with me from a very early age. I'm not a skilled trade person like my father, but I do bring the appointment, the commitment of my parents in helping others in providing safe homes and workplaces for our residents. We're in challenging times.

At DOB, we are still working diligently to provide our permit and inspection services to the city. We're just doing a little bit differently with remote and alternative processes when necessary. I'm grateful to and proud of our dedicated staff who have quickly and effectively pivoted to keep our services going without missing a beat.

As I already share with many of you, we quickly implemented a system to accept permit applications not already online to an email processing system. We've also had a regular mail system and a drop box in the city hall for people without an email. Today, I'm pleased to report that that system has not only worked extremely well, but has been well received by the public.

Now more than ever, it's essential that we keep services going forward. While we create efficiencies through new technologies, we have recently implemented virtual inspections as an additional tool in certain cases. These inspections involve a contractor with a mobile device walking through the work site while an inspector views on the mobile device off-site.

We find this is very promising when dealing with our good contractors who work we expect to be code compliant. Virtual inspections can also increase our inspection productivity and reduce expenses as inspectors do not need to travel from site to site. Virtual inspections can be another tool but would not be a substitute for in-person on-site inspections for developers or contractors with a history of non-compliant work.

Finally, our important work on modernizing the Chicago construction codes to provide safer and more cost-effective construction will continue with the plumbing and mechanical codes through 2021, starting with the technical cleanup package for your consideration later in this meeting. Again, DOB remains a partner in the commitment of the Mayor and the Council to the equitable strengthening of investment and quality of life for all 77 communities of Chicago. I'm honored to be here before you today and I thank you for your consideration for my appointment.

I look forward to working with each of you and I'm happy to answer questions you may have. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (52:42 - 52:57)
Thank you, Matt. The first question or hand up was Alderman Villegas, but I see you might have put it down. Gil, do you have a question for Matt Boudot?

[Speaker 57] (52:58 - 52:59)
No, Chairman. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (53:00 - 53:03)
Okay. Then next, Raymond Lopez.

[Speaker 2] (53:07 - 55:24)
Thank you, Chairman. Matt, good morning to you. I actually want to say that I am very happy and excited to support Mayor Lightfoot's appointment of you and promotion of Marlene.

I know everyone is taking a bated breath for that comment, so I'll say it again. I'm very happy to have both of you continue on. You both have served my community well, especially under Commissioner Friedman, and I look forward to your continued efforts, particularly as we target troubled buildings, as well as those problem buildings that oftentimes are the magnets for crime in our community.

I don't think people truly understand how valuable the Department of Buildings is when it comes to addressing the violence and the drugs that we see so often flowing through our neighborhoods. Your department and your inspectors have routinely been able to help us when so often the courts have failed us, particularly using the troubled buildings ordinance to hold landlords accountable. To that point, I'm going to ask the same thing that I've asked before, and I'm going to ask that you and your team seriously consider working with the law department to find a way to ensure that we have a user-friendly option for making those bad actors more publicly known in the city of Chicago, so that we can identify and bring scrutiny to those individuals who think that simply being an absent owner relieves them of any responsibility that they or their tenants have to our communities. I think it will make all of our jobs easier, and it will definitely make our communities safer if they know that their information will be made public if their tenants are causing harm to the neighborhoods where their properties exist. I will keep it at that.

We have a great ability to talk, and we can talk further online. But I'm glad for both, and I hope that Ernestine is still somewhere floating around in that office as well, as well as to thank all of you for everything that you do for the 15th Ward and its communities. And I look forward to voting here as well as tomorrow for your appointment.

Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (55:25 - 55:28)
Thank you, Alderman. Alderman David Moore.

[Speaker 12] (55:33 - 57:43)
Am I unmuted? You're ready to go, David. Thank you.

Thank you, Chairman. Thank you for this opportunity. First of all, I wanted to thank Acting Commissioner Mappadale for meeting with me, and it was a good opportunity to get to talk with him.

Although I had seen him around City Hall, I really didn't have a relationship with him. But with that said, you gave the analogy of feeling like Phil Jackson. I hope you recognize with no doubt and you agree that Marlene is probably not probably, but he is your Michael Jordan of that team.

And so, yes, when the mayor made this appointment, I had some concerns. It had nothing to do with you. Personally, it could have been my mama and I would have had a concern.

And because Marlene has been at the top of the game, one that many of us rely on. And so but after having conversations with you and others, you know, I'm willing to accept this appointment. I know that every commissioner, whether it was Michael Merchant before you, Felicia Davis before you, Judy Freeland before you.

There's not one person that didn't say they couldn't do that job without first deputy Marlene Hopkins. So I'm grateful for her ascension to first deputy, although I thought she was already first deputy based on us calling on her and her role. Not only do but through budget, but also through the course of our everyday dealings with the buildings department.

My only question becomes Chairman, if somebody can tell me because I don't have the budget in front of me. What are the salaries of the commissioner versus the first deputy Alderman?

[Speaker 1] (57:43 - 57:48)
I don't have a budget book in front of me, but we will get that through.

[Speaker 12] (57:48 - 58:24)
We'll get that information through our office to our committee members. All right. Because who's ever doing this?

I hope, you know, unlike Michael Jordan, who for many years wasn't compensated for his great works and achievements. I'm hoping Marlene is completely compensated for the work that she does. And I'm not saying she isn't.

I just need to know that she is. So I hope I can have that before. I hope I can have that before end of day, before end of day.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (58:25 - 58:28)
Thank you, Alderman Marie Haddon.

[Speaker 15] (58:30 - 59:25)
Thank you, Chair. Just wanted to celebrate and support this appointment. Mr. Beaudet, I remember how generous you were with your time and sitting down with me what seems like forever ago. We'll say maybe eight months ago or so to help me to help walk me through as a new older person. Some of the different ways that Department of Buildings works around bringing property owners to compliance. I appreciate the assistance of your department and wish you the best of luck.

I appreciate the conversations that we've had leading up to to this decision and commend the mayor on the selection of you as our next commissioner. So thank you very much. Enthusiastically supportive here.

And congratulations.

[Speaker 1] (59:26 - 59:34)
Thank you, Alderman. And we will put you on for purposes of the roll call. Alderman Harry Osterman.

[Speaker 48] (59:35 - 1:00:33)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to echo Alderman Haddon and Matt. Just want to congratulate you.

You've really earned this role. You also have the perspective of working in the department and knowing the high level of success and how value your valuable the department is to everyday Chicagoans. So Marlene, you're phenomenal.

You guys are a wonderful team. And we are all the Alderman and the citizens of Chicago rely on you. So we wish you well.

We look forward to seeing you during the budget where we can get more into the department. Just want to encourage you in your new role as the commissioner not to be shy to ask for assistance and resources from the council. So we want to make sure that you've got what you need to be successful, even in a very difficult budget year.

So all the best. Look forward to working with you. Thank you.

[Speaker 11] (1:00:33 - 1:00:33)
Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (1:00:33 - 1:00:37)
Thank you, Alderman. Alderman Walter Burnett.

[Speaker 7] (1:00:38 - 1:02:14)
Yeah. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I also like to commend the mayor on this appointment.

I also like to commend the mayor on not bringing in an outsider, bringing in someone who has been around, who knows people, who gets things done. You know, it was amazing. So they reminded me how I knew him.

I knew him from the 80s when he was at the law department with my kid brother. So he's been around for a long time. He worked his way up and he's done very well.

I appreciate him. I appreciate the mayor also given given Marlene a boost as well deserves. I know, O'Day, you appreciate and recognize that you have great people working for you.

Marlene and also with Carl Byrd and the rest of the folks you have in that department expect great things from you. Our conversation, you touched on a lot of things that you were concerned about with the department, not having inspectors to one inspector come and inspect, then another inspector come and say something different. And you just understand the complaints that community people have in reference to some of those little things.

But they're actually big things for people in the community. And I appreciate that. And I appreciate your understanding and congratulations to you and look forward to working with you.

[Speaker 1] (1:02:15 - 1:02:18)
Thank you, Alderman. Thank you, Alderman. Alderman Cardona.

[Speaker 22] (1:02:19 - 1:03:10)
Thank you, Chairman. I want to take this opportunity to congratulate Matt Boutte. I got the honor of having conversations with him before this appointment.

I congratulate the mayor for picking, like my colleague, Walter Burnett, Alderman Burnett said, someone that knows and not going outside, but picking within. And also a great choice, Matt, for picking Marlene to help you out in that office and everybody else. I wish you the best.

And you've been very humble with me. And every time I had an issue, you were there to pick up. I thank you for that.

And tomorrow I will be voting to be the next commissioner of the building department. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:03:11 - 1:03:18)
Thank you, Alderman. Thank you, Alderman. And last with the hand up is Alderman Brian Hunt.

[Speaker 30] (1:03:18 - 1:04:13)
Thank you, Chairman. Quickly, just to add my voice to those in strong support of this mayoral appointment. I think it's an outstanding choice.

And I agree totally with the sentiment just expressed by two of our colleagues that it's important for a position like this to have institutional memory. There are times when you really do want to bring in an outsider with fresh perspective and take a look and bring new ideas. But that is not the case for the building commissioner.

This position requires intimate knowledge of the streets and the alleys and the buildings of Chicago. And Commissioner, you have that in your team with Marlene and everyone else is outstanding. And as Alderman, we appreciate that.

It's so important that we have a good relationship and a good interface with your department from the top down. So I'm pleased to support this nomination and I look forward to confirmation. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:13 - 1:04:32)
Thank you. And I know Alderman Roboius had to leave, but he wanted to be on the record in full support. I don't see any other hands up on this one.

May I have a motion to pass on the appointment by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 2] (1:04:32 - 1:04:34)
I'll move Chairman Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:34 - 1:04:43)
Alderman Ray Lopez moves to pass. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Congratulations, Matt. Look forward to continue working with you.

[Speaker 11] (1:04:44 - 1:04:49)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Alderman. Let's see.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:49 - 1:05:23)
Next appointment is A-2020-115. The appointment of Timothy Knudson as chair and member of Zoning Board of Appeals. Timothy was, well, you have his resume, but he has been on the Zoning Board as the alternate.

And now hopefully with his discussions today with us would be moved to be the chair of the member of the Zoning Board of Appeals. All right. So, Timothy.

[Speaker 6] (1:05:24 - 1:05:26)
Yeah, just to confirm, Chairman, can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (1:05:27 - 1:05:28)
Yes.

[Speaker 6] (1:05:28 - 1:05:28)
OK.

[Speaker 1] (1:05:29 - 1:05:31)
Identify yourself for the record, sir.

[Speaker 6] (1:05:31 - 1:07:00)
My name is Timothy Knudson and I live at 2139 North Sheffield. Thank you, Chairman Tunney and members of the committee. My name, again, is Timothy Knudson, and I'm honored to come before you today to seek confirmation of my appointment as chairman to the Zoning Board of Appeals.

By profession, I'm a partner at the law firm of Croke, Fairchild, Morgan & Ferris. I work mostly with entrepreneurs and startup companies such as tech companies. We give external general counsel on a variety of issues and assisting company investment rounds and sales.

In addition, I have a pro bono practice in representing immigrant applicants for asylum in the United States. My focus has been largely on LGBTQ plus undocumented individuals. And over the past few years, the need in this space has increased greatly.

For the past year, I have served as the alternate member of the Zoning Board of Appeals. In this role, I have voted in four meetings and in several of the meetings in which I did not vote, I observed. It was a pleasure to learn from Farzan Parang as chairman, and now I look forward to the opportunity of serving myself.

The Zoning Board of Appeals is a dynamic board with a wide variety of duties. If I am confirmed today, I view it as my duty to ensure that every applicant that appears in front of the board is treated with equal respect and attention. I appreciate all of your commitment to the city and for your time today.

Thank you. Thank you, Timothy, and I know how to pronounce your last name.

[Speaker 1] (1:07:00 - 1:07:15)
I was just with you, sir. All right. Questions from committee members.

I see first Alderman Ray Lopez. Are you.

[Speaker 2] (1:07:19 - 1:07:36)
You're on. Chairman, I have a question for you. Is this the gentleman that was.

I know there was an auxiliary. Yeah, he's the first alternate. Was he the alternate that was his appointment was blocked previously.

[Speaker 1] (1:07:36 - 1:07:44)
No, he had smooth sailing I believe when we did his appointment to the zoning board is the first alternate.

[Speaker 2] (1:07:45 - 1:08:18)
Okay. And I'm just curious, is with regard, no disrespect to Mr. Knutson. It seems highly unusual to pick an alternate for head of the ZBA, as opposed to those members that were previously full full members to that body.

Is that something that either the administration or someone would care to comment on.

[Speaker 1] (1:08:24 - 1:09:36)
I don't I don't think we have anyone from Patrick Murphy or someone from zoning on the call. I do know that in when we hear from maybe if you hear from the department. The problem was that there was.

We needed alternates as you know because we need a minimum of three votes on the zoning board of appeals otherwise they don't meet, or they don't they don't make decisions so it was the idea with everyone's busy schedule and that we needed the alternate. So that was relatively new if I'm not mistaken. And with that, the obviously that was the mayor's point pick, but I believe that I, I believe that he, Timothy and he'll speak for himself, had has a very good role even as alternate and the rapport of his committee members, and I think that I've talked to a few of them they're excited about Tim's.

And I believe that you might want to comment a little bit more on that.

[Speaker 6] (1:09:37 - 1:09:47)
Tim. Yeah. So if I may, it's also it's my understanding that the last few chairman to the ZBA had not previously served on the ZBA in any capacity.

[Speaker 2] (1:09:47 - 1:10:42)
So my next question then is as chairman with the ZBA and especially now as we're set poised to discuss even more work in a caseload coming your direction, assuming the mayor's one of the mayor's ordinances is approved. After these appointments, you know, more and more seems to be coming towards it seems to be this administration's desire to send more and more applications and things to the ZBA to adjudicate. Do you think that's the proper role?

And if so, do you think the ZBA has the ability to handle a surge in cases that that potential ordinances would send to it? Yeah, yeah, no, I can't in a in a quickly, a quick and fair manner.

[Speaker 6] (1:10:42 - 1:12:30)
Yeah, I think that's a definitely a fair question to related to some meetings we've had in the past few months that have gone very late at night. It's nobody's goal. Yeah, right.

It's definitely nobody's goal to add a second meeting in the month. We don't want to as chairman. I need to make sure that there's no backlog because where we do have the big kind of corporate applicants.

As you know, we also have a lot of pro se applicants who it's my duty to make sure that they don't have barriers in their way of starting to do business. I think a lot of this goes to process and what we're learning with these applicants that are more the corporate applicants, for example, dispensaries is there's going to be a lot of objectors that are very organized in hiring attorneys and not our typical community objectors. It's definitely my mission to make sure every objector is heard, but I want to make sure that every objector is heard equally and that it's not so weighted in favor of, for example, a competition objector.

I think we can manage the conversation on the objections a little bit better. There's no reason for repetition or lawyers just getting in cross examination matches. I'm going to make sure that going in as we control the agenda, we make sure there's no backlog.

It might be necessary for a few meetings to go very late into the night as they have been to confirm that as we ease out of this pandemic and people are trying to start to do business in their community again, that we have a heavier caseload. That being said, process-wise, questioning, controlling the conversation, I think there's a way to do some of these matters a little bit more efficiently.

[Speaker 2] (1:12:33 - 1:12:57)
One question that's near and dear to my heart and about 49 other people that I know is when it comes to the local aldermen having a difference of opinion to the ZBA or to its membership, do you believe that we are the first and best voice when it comes to being a reflection of the wards and communities that we represent?

[Speaker 6] (1:12:58 - 1:14:22)
I was thinking about how I responded to this a year ago, and I actually think it's a pretty spot on similar response. Aldermen are elected because they know their community and their community has trusted them to champion their community. As an independent board member, and I can speak for the other board members, we can't be expected nor would we ever claim to know the intricacies of the 50 wards.

I'd say when it comes to aldermanic input in relation to the ZBA, at times, I think we just need it to be more of a conversation and we can't just base it off of a letter that's a simple yes or no. We just need to make sure that aldermen present us a piece of evidence, which is their opinion, that's thinly targeted towards our set standards for special uses or variations. If it's done so in that way, it's the strongest piece of evidence we have.

I also would encourage, as some of these conversations get more intricate, I know you all are so busy. Just to, when you can, show up to be a part of the conversation, because we often do push for compromise among the objector and the applicant at the meetings. When you or a member of your staff can show up to be a part of that compromise to create conditions on a certain approval, et cetera, I invite that and think that would be a great benefit.

[Speaker 2] (1:14:25 - 1:15:47)
Well, thank you. I appreciate that. I think my concerns is that the caseload of ZBA seems to be growing exponentially.

It's hard to ensure that our residents, like you said, have a voice, let alone that the aldermen are being listened to and accommodated. The last thing that I want to see is that our city goes from being a city that works to a city that barely moves. I think that can definitely be laid at your feet as chairman now if that perception continues.

I do want to say on a personal note that I think that having a personal background of assisting those who are most vulnerable in our city hopefully will help you. As you deal with our communities, like the ones that I represent, whether it's West Englewood or Back of the Yards, where individuals do not have the ability to hire lawyers, but have the same dream of moving their families forward and building a successful platform for which to raise families and exist in this city. I will support your nomination, but I want you never to forget that point because otherwise you will see me start showing up at ZBAs.

I prefer not to in an enraged manner. I appreciate that. Thank you.

[Speaker 12] (1:15:51 - 1:17:46)
David Moore. Thank you, Chairman. First of all, I want to say that I didn't get a chance to talk to you, Timothy, like I did with Brian.

I had a good conversation with him. But from your testimony here, especially addressing the questions that my colleague, Alderman Raymond Lopez, raised, which was going to be one of my questions so you don't have to repeat it, but your answer to me, and I felt that some people answer questions just because they want to hear you say a certain thing. I truly felt you believed what you just said, and I truly appreciate that for, you know, support the mayor's appointment here for you as being chairman of the ZBA.

My only question is, as we're dealing with everything that's going on at the state as relates to marijuana, and as these zoning applications come before ZBA, sort of along the lines of what my colleague, Alderman Lopez, raised, but different because something's got to be weighed heavily different because of the importance of it, because of the issue that's surrounding it versus a barbershop versus a marijuana shop. So with that said, how do you view those in relation to aldermanic input?

Are you saying you would weigh those equally, or you would see that aldermanic input on that is weighed a little more heavily when it comes to things like that?

[Speaker 6] (1:17:46 - 1:17:59)
Okay, so Alderman Morton, just to make sure I have the question right, is it how I weigh alderman input on different types of matters? For example, a special use such as dispensaries versus a special use like a barbershop?

[Speaker 12] (1:17:59 - 1:18:01)
Absolutely. You got it.

[Speaker 6] (1:18:02 - 1:18:52)
Honestly, I think it's the same holistic conversation. I know that oftentimes with the dispensaries, there's going to be more intricacies, especially with it being a new issue. But I do view the alderman having the same power of perspective on whether it's a barbershop where an objector shows up that there's too much competition in the area, that that's a good piece of input from the alderman.

And for that matter, I weigh it equally to the alderman fitting it into our standards on dispensaries. I know the conversations in length and nuance might be a little briefer on the barbershops, for example, than the dispensaries, but I think the overall way of looking at things is going to be the same for me.

[Speaker 12] (1:18:54 - 1:18:56)
Right. Thank you. Thank you, Chairman.

That's the only question I had.

[Speaker 50] (1:18:56 - 1:18:57)
Thank you.

[Speaker 12] (1:18:58 - 1:18:59)
Thank you, Alderman Patow.

[Speaker 50] (1:19:01 - 1:19:38)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Hello, Ms. Smithson. I want to just let you know, as I indicated to you, I would be supporting your appointment as chairman of the ZBA, but I wanted to follow up on something that Alderman Moore brought up, but in a different way.

I know the ZBA has these five criteria that you all consider when you look at a zoning matter. And my question is, when it comes to the criteria that talks about adverse impact, how do you think about that?

[Speaker 6] (1:19:39 - 1:21:15)
Yeah, I think that's a good question because often that's at the root of our conversation and deliberations, and it's a broad, you know, hardship and adverse impact are two very broad criteria. So the way we do it, I always want to run through the criteria. So, for example, on a variation, we look at that there's strict compliance with the zoning ordinance.

Then we look at that that strict compliance with the zoning ordinance would create a hardship. From there, it's that the hardship isn't created by the applicant themselves. I think that's where we've run into some issues in the past that I hope to address in a different way.

Where more sophisticated players around the city have created a hardship for themselves and are coming back in front of us saying, you know, it's a hardship. You know, fool me once, shame on, you know, the same. But I don't think we can have those done over and over and be able to all say, yeah, we have a ZBA that's treating the whole city equally and fairly because not everyone is able to hire those sophisticated parties to come represent them.

So a lot of the hardship, too, is, you know, it goes into that broader conversation of an impact on the character of the neighborhood, impact on public convenience, public safety. It's definitely a broad criteria and one I think that we'll be taking seriously in how we view it and view it consistently while I hopefully become chairman.

[Speaker 50] (1:21:15 - 1:21:25)
So are those conversations that you as chairman feel that you have to have with the other members of the ZBA so that you all are coming at this more consistently?

[Speaker 6] (1:21:26 - 1:21:42)
Yeah, I think so. And I think it's a big role as chairman that in a way, you know, I lead the conversation and asking questions of the applicants and objectors. And I kind of view that as my duty to lead down that path that we are treating hardship consistently.

[Speaker 50] (1:21:42 - 1:21:52)
All right. So I wish you the best in your new role and I will be voting in favor of this chairman. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:21:52 - 1:21:56)
Thank you, Alderman. Alderman Walter Burnett. Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 7] (1:21:57 - 1:24:06)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I want to apologize because I actually had a phone call when you were saying your resume, so I'm not sure about it. But I do want to having so many things in my ward that come before your committee before the ZBA, I'm somewhat concerned.

Right. I think that everybody on their body does a great job and very fair. One of the things David did touch on the marijuana dispensary situation, you know, for a lot of us.

You know, the marijuana dispensary thing is not as much legislation as it is at this point, emotional and ethnic. Right. So I don't know how how you feel about that.

You know, one of the things that a lot of us are concerned about, you know, with all of these guys that's coming before you, that's in my ward. I try to encourage them to have some type of minority participation, whether it be renting a building from African-American, you know, have an African-American managing there. You know, they rent the building.

They get a piece of the profits as a landlord. They manage the dispensary. They get some of the profits.

You know, we try to figure out some creative ways to encourage folks to be involved because of the state legislation. You know, don't want them to change their corporations, so to speak. But a lot of these guys, and I have to hand it to them, are coming up with some creative ways.

I don't know if the ZBA has been encouraging those things and asking those things or requiring some of those things to happen. I want to know, how do you feel about those type of things?

[Speaker 6] (1:24:07 - 1:24:55)
Yeah, I think it's a very important question. And I think where the ZBA is trying to figure out what its role is, is how to ask the questions based on the part of the process that we are considering the applicants from. But going off your line of conversation, I would say that fits into the special use standard of would this have a detrimental effect on the community?

This is me somewhat thinking holistically as a lawyer. But in a way, it could have a detrimental impact on the community for people to come in and make money that aren't representatives of the community. And that can definitely be a part of our conversation when we have applicants and objectors in front of us.

[Speaker 7] (1:24:56 - 1:26:36)
OK, so, you know, like I gave you an example, one organization, Acreage, they have a social equity, 10 percent social equity component. Right. So so so what I'm saying is that some guys have and maybe I don't know how much research you've done on some of the organizations that have come before the ZBA.

Some some organizations or some businesses that have come before the ZBA have raised the bar. Right. They raised the bar that that they did something to include minority participation.

Right. So they raised the bar. So I'm just hoping that in your leadership that you would you would encourage and inquire about, you know, where where the other folks are with the bar.

Right. And because, you know, whenever they come to me, I always tell them, hey, this guy doing this, what you're going to do. Right.

So you can't say you can't help folks because these people are helping folks. Why you can't help folks. Right.

So I just want you to know that the bar has been raised with some inclusion because, you know, folks really want to try to do something. And especially after the Black Lives Matter thing, some of these guys were concerned about their places getting wrecked and tore up and burnt up and all those things. They really want to do things to let folks know that they care about this situation.

So I just want to make sure that the ZBA, you know, just pose the question. That's all I do is pose the question that folks volunteer to do do the right thing. So.

[Speaker 6] (1:26:38 - 1:26:51)
I think that's a really good point. Yeah. And I think, you know, in the the the powers of chairman, I think I can pose that question pretty directly because we're just trying to get all the facts to the surface.

So.

[Speaker 7] (1:26:52 - 1:26:59)
All right. Fantastic. Thank you.

I support this appointment. Thank you. I look forward to working with you.

[Speaker 6] (1:26:59 - 1:27:00)
Yeah. You as well.

[Speaker 1] (1:27:01 - 1:27:03)
Alderman Sitio Lopez.

[Speaker 5] (1:27:05 - 1:28:14)
Thank you, Chairman. I just have a few questions. Just given the importance of these appointments, a lot of items are going to go in front of this.

In fact, at least one of the ordinances that we're going to be discussing today is going to be in front of the zoning advisory board outside of the dispensaries. Of course, that I hear quite a bit. My question to Mr. Knudsen. Sorry, I may not pronounce it correctly. I see from your resume that you are a partner at Croke, Fairchild Morgan and Berris. You know, for what I see, you advise on venture capital, private equity and other corporate clients through transactions and service as an outside general counsel.

Do you see any kind of conflict in the kind, especially I know that today we're going to be discussing, you know, the potential even of some industrial amendments that are going to be made. Do you foresee or do you see any conflict of interest on that and the kind of work that you do?

[Speaker 6] (1:28:15 - 1:29:05)
Yeah. You know, so with the work I do, I foresee very little conflict of interest. Most of the clients we work on, a lot of them aren't in Chicago even.

And it's a lot of, for the most part, it's tech companies. But there's always the potential for conflict of interest to come up. I don't work on real property issues.

I don't work on zoning issues. Those would obviously be really direct conflicts. If there's any related parties, I'm always going to be sensitive to just recusing myself from the conversation pretty immediately.

You know, I don't see there being too many instances where it comes up. But you've got my word here that I'm going to be very sensitive when they do come up and just dropping out of the conversation and having a different member come in as chairman, which is how we kind of do the recusals.

[Speaker 5] (1:29:07 - 1:30:07)
I'm in particular very interested because, like you said, I think you said it's potential, you know, there could be conflict of interest. I think that I really urge my colleagues to really listen very carefully when we put things in front of the zoning advisory board, especially items like dispensaries or industrial zones. I do think that the issue of independence has got to be critical, right?

That we do things on behalf of the residents. I think that that's really paramount. So the independence of that, I think that you've heard a few questions in line of the importance of community feedback and so forth.

I understand that this is a mayoral appointment, so I must ask, have you been participating politically with the mayor's office? Have you donated to the mayor's campaign in the past?

[Speaker 6] (1:30:07 - 1:30:30)
Yeah, I have. And I can be transparent about that. With Mayor Lightfoot, I helped her campaign as early as would have been September 2018, pre-primary.

And in the city, I do some grassroots stuff around my ward, like community organization type of political work.

[Speaker 5] (1:30:30 - 1:31:55)
I think it is very important, I think, and again, I really urge my colleagues to listen to this because a lot of the conversations have gone around this issue of prerogative, which is automatic or mayoral. I think the people in the city of Chicago have advocated for community prerogative, making sure that the people in the city and evidence. Because I'm really concerned about some of the things that I continue to see in terms of the lack of independence that we have in terms of guaranteeing the independence of our decisions.

So how do you see this issue? How do you ensure that it is really, I mean, honestly, I have even seen overstepping of the executive branch into legislative matters quite significantly. And I don't know historically how much has that been.

And that's one of my concerns. And I can give you proximity to the mayor's office. How do you ensure independence?

And do you have communications with the mayor's office? Do you have communications with the legislative branch? I'm just trying to understand how do we maintain independence in a time when people in the city of Chicago is demanding transparency, accountability, and a process that takes away this kind of conflict of interest that we see how damaging it has been for the city.

[Speaker 6] (1:31:56 - 1:32:56)
Yeah, yeah, I totally hear you. And for example, the only time I've had communication with them as a ZBA related item is with this appointment. Since I was appointed as alternate member last September, I believe it was August or September, I halted all political activity with the office and have given no money.

I think it's an important question because we are meant to be independent. And that means in our realm objective for and I will, you know, fully it's my mission to keep it that way. I think I'm pretty good at keeping things objective and looking at things from a third party and then bringing that voice to the table.

But it's like you said, it's these conflicts and everything you've brought up are always something for involved people to have on their mind.

[Speaker 5] (1:32:57 - 1:32:59)
Thank you, Chairman. That was my last question.

[Speaker 6] (1:33:01 - 1:33:05)
Thank you, Alderman. I do not see any more hands up.

[Speaker 1] (1:33:07 - 1:33:34)
If there are no further questions by committee members, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Mr. Chairman Alderman Austin. Moved by Alderman Austin.

All those in Alderman Austin moves to pass on the appointment. Any objections? Hearing none.

The item is passed. Congratulations. I look forward to continue to work with you, Timothy.

[Speaker 6] (1:33:34 - 1:33:36)
Thank you, everyone, for your time.

[Speaker 1] (1:33:38 - 1:34:02)
The next appointment is a 2020 dash 116. The appointment of Brian Sanchez as a member of the Zoning Board of Appeals. Brian, I see you on the screen.

You're up, sir. And I think our committee members already have your resume sent to them beforehand.

[Speaker 49] (1:34:02 - 1:35:40)
Thank you. Good morning, Chairman Tunney and members of the committee. My name is Brian Sanchez, and I come before you today seeking confirmation of my appointment as a member of the Zoning Board of Appeals.

To provide a little bit of my background, I obtained my bachelor's degree in political science from the University of Illinois and my law degree from DePaul University College of Law. During law school, I interned for the first ward office under former alderman Manny Flores, where I got a glimpse of the great work that aldermen do for their residents. And I was honored to be able to participate in that work.

Since graduating from law school, I have focused my legal practice on civil defense litigation and appeals. I am currently a partner at the law firm of Sanchez, Daniels and Hoffman, the largest minority owned law firm in the city of Chicago. Outside of my legal practice, I have donated my time to supporting various not for profit organizations, supporting local charitable organizations that focus on child education and wellness.

Finally, on a personal note, I've had the privilege to live in the city of Chicago for the last 18 years. I live in the first ward with my wife, Yifan, and my seven-year-old daughter, Ling Li. I'm truly honored to have been appointed to the Zoning Board of Appeals in order to serve the city in a capacity where I can use my background and experience to address the issues that come before me.

If confirmed, I look forward to working with all of you to make this city a better place for all of its residents. I thank you and I welcome any questions from the committee.

[Speaker 1] (1:35:43 - 1:35:49)
Thank you, Mr. Sanchez. On this one, I don't see any hands up yet.

[Speaker 2] (1:35:51 - 1:35:55)
All right. Hearing... Move due pass, Chairman Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 1] (1:35:55 - 1:36:15)
Okay, then. There are no questions by committee members. Alderman Ray Lopez moves due pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections to that motion? Hearing no objections, the item is passed. Congratulations.

Thank you, Brian. Look forward to working with you also.

[Speaker 49] (1:36:16 - 1:36:16)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:36:17 - 1:36:39)
All right. Next appointment. We have, by the way, there's three of them, are reappointments to the Public Building Commission.

And we will start with A-2020-117, the reappointment of Jose Maldonado as a member of the Public Building Commission. Mr. Maldonado.

[Speaker 33] (1:36:42 - 1:37:09)
Thank you, Chairman Antoni and members of the committee. My name is Jose Maldonado, and I come before the committee seeking confirmation for my reappointment as a member of the Public Building Commission. A little bit about myself.

Born and raised in Chicago, grew up in the Pilsen neighborhood. My professional side, I'm a business rep for the Chicago Regional Council of Carpenters, and I'm also financial secretary for Carpenters Local 54.

[Speaker 50] (1:37:10 - 1:37:14)
Excuse me, Mr. Maldonado. Yes. Can you turn your video on, please?

[Speaker 33] (1:37:15 - 1:39:56)
Oh, I'm so sorry. How's that? Thank you.

You're welcome. Like I said, I've been on the PBC board for about six years. I have construction industry experience for about 20.

When I first got appointed to the Public Building Commission, one of my main goals was to be proactive. Not just to be a vote, but to be a voice for our communities with these projects, but also for the people working on there and trying to assist as much as I could as a business representative to make sure that we have the right people from the communities on those projects. Also, on the being proactive part of it, with the partnership between the Chicago Regional Council of Carpenters and the Public Building Commission, we were able to create a safety partnership between both offices.

We always pride ourselves on time and on their budget, but we also have to take pride in our work and to make sure that these residents that are working on these projects go home the same way they came in. So that's been our number one goal, and it's been proven to work well, especially now that we're going through this pandemic in regards to our safety program. Prior to this actually hitting in March, between the PBC, the Chicago Regional Council, and myself, we actually sat down and created some sort of program to advise the people on the job site on how to be safe.

Now, if we wouldn't have taken this proactive approach, I honestly believe that the consequences would have been a little bit worse than what we anticipated. Dealing with this pandemic is not something like we have a handbook and it tells us exactly what we need to do during a pandemic, but it actually helped out into making sure that the residents and the people that are working on those projects, like I said before, are better taken care of. That's something that I continue to push on.

Like I said, I take pride into being a representative there at the PBC for this great city, but also for our communities and our residents. And I would probably continue to represent to the best of my ability. And if there's any other questions, I'll be more than happy to answer them.

[Speaker 1] (1:39:58 - 1:40:15)
Thank you, Mr. Maldonado. I do not see any hands up. So with that, if there are no questions by committee members, do I hear a motion to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 57] (1:40:15 - 1:40:17)
So moved by Alderman Villegas.

[Speaker 1] (1:40:17 - 1:40:28)
Alderman Villegas moves to pass. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Congratulations and look forward to continue working with you.

[Speaker 48] (1:40:29 - 1:40:30)
Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (1:40:30 - 1:40:44)
All right. Our next appointment is A-2020-118, the reappointment of David Whitley as a member of the Public Building Commission. David?

[Speaker 28] (1:40:46 - 1:40:51)
Thank you, Chairman Tooney and to the members of the committee. Can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (1:40:51 - 1:40:53)
We can hear you and now we can see you.

[Speaker 28] (1:40:53 - 1:43:48)
Thank you, sir. My name again is David Todd Whitley, as you stated. I come before the committee seeking confirmation for my reappointment as a member of the Public Building Commission.

I am a proud and lifelong member or lifelong resident, excuse me, of Chicago, having attended grade school, high school and college here in our city, born and raised in the Roseland community. By profession, I am celebrating this year, 17 years as a pastor of one of the legendary churches in our city, Corinthian Temple Church of God in Christ, founded by my grandfather, the late Bishop Benny Allison. Our church is in West Garfield Park community and we are a church without walls, and so we're very much involved in the life of our community, providing services to hundreds and thousands of individuals.

In that same regard, I serve as the president of our community-based organization entitled United for Better Living. We really emphasize adult literacy, youth development, computer training, senior services, and teaching people how to start and manage successful small businesses. I serve as the chair of the faith-based committee for the 11th District Police Department.

So again, an opportunity to give back to our community where we really rally residents, nonprofit organizations, clergy, pastors in our community around safety and community goodwill. In terms of my profession in finance and banking, 20 plus years working for some of the largest and most recognizable banks in our city before I started to pastor, and also at a period of time served as a financial consultant to churches and nonprofit organizations as they were looking to secure funding to expand or increase their work and what they were trying to do and their properties. And so between community service, being a pastor on the front line in our community, and then 20 plus years in the banking industry, I'm able to bring that level of experience and voice and push, if you will, to the PBC in making sure not only that our city is beautiful from our various public buildings, but we also have a high representation of minority and women-owned businesses.

And so I look forward to serving, working with our mayor and each of you. And I love our city and I appreciate the opportunity to serve on the Public Building Commission and seek to do so for another term. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:43:48 - 1:43:54)
Thank you, David. Questions by committee members.

[Speaker 7] (1:43:58 - 1:44:23)
Alderman Walter Burnett. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think it's a blessing to have the pastor on board.

He's very active on the west side. He cares about people. He cares about the community.

He's been doing a great job thus far. I support him being reappointed to this body, to that body.

[Speaker 1] (1:44:23 - 1:44:40)
Thank you, Alderman. And I do not see other hands up. If there are no further questions by committee members, do I hear a motion to pass?

[Speaker 56] (1:44:41 - 1:44:42)
Alderman Hopkins moves to pass.

[Speaker 1] (1:44:43 - 1:44:53)
That was used to determine quorum. Alderman Brian Hopkins moves to pass. Any objections?

Hearing none, the item is passed. Congratulations, David.

[Speaker 12] (1:44:53 - 1:46:46)
I'm sorry. I couldn't find my mute button. I couldn't find my raise hand button.

All right. Would you want to say a few words on the appointment? Yes, just thank you so much.

First of all, I commend the mayor for this appointment. But also, I just want to go into the fact of importance of the public building commission and the importance of it for making sure that entities, our public entities, are utilizing PBC. There are great opportunities there in the PBC, especially for vendors as we try to get minority vendors in different programs and get them making sure that they get opportunities.

I think the public has to set the stage for that as it relates even to the private industry. So if we're not doing that on the public side, then the private industry sometimes say, well, the PBC is not even doing it. So those things become important in how we utilize the PBC.

But making sure that CPS is using them heavily when they're doing work, the park district. And I think there was a time that they were heavily used. And I think there's been some drop off.

And so that is going to be very critical to me because we don't need and we also need to look at our pricing structures there and make sure that we're competitive as well without breaking the bank on us. And so those things are important. And I want to make sure that Mr. Whitley, as a member of that. Duly noted.

[Speaker 28] (1:46:46 - 1:46:47)
Thank you, sir. Thank you all. I'm duly noted.

[Speaker 12] (1:46:47 - 1:46:53)
All right. Thank you. Thank you, Chairman, for giving me the opportunity.

I'm sorry. I was slow clicking. No problem.

[Speaker 1] (1:46:54 - 1:47:33)
No problem, David. All right. So we did move that item by move by Hopkins and hearing no objection.

The item is passed. All right. The last appointment we have today is a is a 2021 19.

The reappointment of Olga Camargo as a member of the Public Building Commission. The record on your files, it was a typo on the agenda listing the item as a 2021 17. The correct listing is a 2020 dash 119.

So, Olga.

[Speaker 27] (1:47:33 - 1:50:38)
Thank you, Chairman tiny and members of the committee. My name is Olga Camargo. And I'm also here before the committee seeking confirmation for my reappointment to the Public Building Commission.

Like some of my other fellow board members on the PVC. I have also been a Chicago resident, did all of for a long time since 1977, and have been gone through the TPS education, and then also to UIC, University of Illinois at Chicago where I received both my undergrad and graduate degrees. I have been a longtime supporter of our nonprofits here in the city.

That's something that very much speaks to me and my family because my family has been helped out by nonprofits. And so it's, it's, I feel an obligation, and also a desire to, to be able to support our nonprofits. I, what I do professionally is I'm a financial advisor I very much.

I enjoy my work because I feel that there is a lot of leveling of the playing field that needs to get done, especially as it relates to helping individuals become retirement ready and retiring with dignity and making sure that you know the right programs are in place for them to be able to do that. And so I have been working next week with a lot of nonprofits to be able to do especially with frontline staff. I feel that, again, big thing for me as a nonprofit because what they do in terms of correcting a lot of the things that we see in our society, and they're very important and important to me.

I would like to continue my work on the PBC because as you know, we've done I think a tremendous job, but I think that more can be done. In my view, I have seen that about two years ago, the PBC was able to get about 20 minority business enterprise and women business enterprises approved to work on 21. I'm sorry I'm 17 CPS projects, capital improvement projects, and that was fantastic.

But I'd like to see more of that, and specifically more of it as it relates to women, women minorities, because MBEs, we have to make sure obviously that everyone's included, but we also have to make a big, a bigger effort when it comes down to helping minority women. And so that's basically why I want to continue to be a part of it to make, hopefully, a bigger difference. Thank you.

And if there are any questions, just let me know.

[Speaker 26] (1:50:38 - 1:50:39)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:50:39 - 1:50:43)
We have a few questions from committee members. I'll start with Alderman Walter Burnett.

[Speaker 35] (1:50:44 - 1:50:45)
Yes.

[Speaker 7] (1:50:47 - 1:52:22)
So, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. First of all, I want to commend Olga and the mayor for this appointment, reappointment.

I actually served with her. She's very conscientious and very concerned about folks being treated fairly, but also it's always good to have a financial perspective on the planning commission with us because you can see things from a different light and how economic development will affect other communities. So, I think it's great to have a person with her perspective on the planning commission.

You know, we have a lot of architects and, you know, some builders and some other folks on there. It's good to have that diversity, but also seeing her being a Latina female and concerned about not-for-profits, she has many perspectives and she brings all of that to the planning commission. And I appreciate serving with her and I think it'd be great for her to be reappointed to this committee.

And, you know, we really should be paying folks to be on these things because just like the zoning committee, Mr. Chairman, as you know, you and I are both on the planning commission. They are long meetings and they don't get paid. So, we appreciate them volunteering to give their civic service to the city of Chicago.

[Speaker 27] (1:52:23 - 1:52:23)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:52:24 - 1:52:27)
Thank you, Alderman. Alderman Mike Rodriguez.

[Speaker 41] (1:52:28 - 1:53:24)
Thank you, Chairman. I can certainly attest to Olga Carmargo's significant history in our community in working to better the lives of community residents, bringing a very holistic perspective. She certainly has a deep understanding of the business world and financial and personal management, but she works to build people's wealth and that perspective is important.

I think what Ms. Carmargo mentioned about investing more, particularly in minority women, is very important. I think she brings a very clear perspective into every room that she walks into and it's much needed. And I certainly support this reappointment and thank you for your service, Ms. Carmargo. And thank you for, you know, coming from our community and being the best of our community and representing us very well. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:53:25 - 1:53:27)
Thank you. Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 57] (1:53:30 - 1:54:09)
Alderman Villegas. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to speak upon this appointment. This is a really great appointment. Olga has been on the PBC.

This is her second term. And some of the questions that she's posed to folks wanting to do business at the PBC are in line with what it is that we're trying to accomplish about leveling the playing field, making sure there's diversity and parity with folks that are actually working on the projects as well as the folks that are actually building the projects. So this is a great reappointment and I look forward to supporting her confirmation.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good luck.

[Speaker 16] (1:54:10 - 1:54:10)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:54:11 - 1:54:21)
All right. I don't see any more hands up. No further questions by committee members.

Do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 59] (1:54:21 - 1:54:22)
Alderman Villegas.

[Speaker 1] (1:54:23 - 1:55:29)
Alderman Rodriguez. Moves do pass. Any objections?

Hearing none, the item is passed. Thank you, Olga. And that concludes our appointments.

Thank you. All right. So going back to the first item on the addendum to the agenda.

Mayoral application 2008, the amendment of the municipal code sections 17-7-0600 and 17-13-0500 by modifying provisions governing special character overlay districts. We have Cindy Rubick from the Department of Planning and Development here to testify on the matter and answer any questions. Nicole, we had briefings for the committee members last week and it was an interesting conversation.

And I think Cindy is here to talk on the item.

[Speaker 21] (1:55:30 - 1:55:31)
Yes.

[Speaker 9] (1:55:31 - 1:55:38)
Thank you so much, Chairman Tunney. And thank you to the Committee on Zoning Landmarks and Building Standards. I'm going to go ahead and share my screen.

[Speaker 1] (1:55:43 - 1:55:45)
I've been told we might have a substitute on this.

[Speaker 9] (1:55:49 - 1:56:01)
It looks like, can you hear me, Chairman Tunney? I can hear you. Great.

It looks like I need to be able to share my screen. I need the host to enable me.

[Speaker 25] (1:56:02 - 1:56:03)
I just did. This is tech support.

[Speaker 9] (1:56:03 - 1:56:16)
Oh, okay. Thank you so much. All right.

I'm still not able to. I'm working on both my phone and my laptop.

[Speaker 25] (1:56:18 - 1:56:22)
From your laptop? Hold on.

[Speaker 9] (1:56:24 - 1:56:26)
The laptop is the one with my video on.

[Speaker 25] (1:56:30 - 1:56:32)
Okay, now you should be able to.

[Speaker 9] (1:56:33 - 1:56:41)
Thank you. Okay. Are you able to see my screen, everyone?

[Speaker 1] (1:56:42 - 1:56:44)
I think we are.

[Speaker 9] (1:56:44 - 1:56:45)
Great. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:56:46 - 1:56:53)
Before we get started, Cindy, do we have a substitute on the ordinance?

[Speaker 9] (1:56:54 - 1:56:57)
Yes. And that should have been provided to you all.

[Speaker 1] (1:56:57 - 1:57:05)
All right. Well, we have to accept it into the committee. So can I get a motion to accept the substitute?

[Speaker 2] (1:57:06 - 1:57:07)
So moved, Chairman. Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 1] (1:57:09 - 1:57:18)
Alderman Lopez moves. Any objections to that? Hearing none, the substitute is in front of us now, Cindy.

So you can proceed.

[Speaker 9] (1:57:19 - 2:04:02)
Thank you so much, Chairman. All right. In our existing zoning code, we have special character overlay districts.

I'm sorry. These are areas designated by the Chicago zoning code that enables additional requirements for neighborhoods or areas that have unique physical characteristics that are generally not present in other areas of the city. So you see on the map, the city-wide map on the right, these are showing the existing overlay districts.

We have several that are in residential neighborhoods, Norwood Park on the far northwest side, north-south port, Roscoe Street, Sheridan Park, near north. We also have some overlay zoning districts that overlap landmark districts. You can see there's one on the far south side in Longwood Drive.

There's one in Burling Street, Dover Street overlaps as well, and Astor Street landmark district overlaps as well. And then we have some overlays that are more for the industrial corridors or special use areas, such as in the north branch industrial corridor. There's an overlay there as well as the Kinsey industrial corridor.

And then the big X, the big purple X that you see, that is around Midway airport to make sure that the flight paths and the heights of the buildings along those flight paths are within safe regulations. The zoning code today, however, is very technical in nature. It's really kind of identifies setbacks or lot sizes or heights.

So it's very numerically based. For example, in Sheridan Park, and this is a photo on the bottom left of this neighborhood, you know, it requires larger front setbacks consistent with the pattern of the front yards in that neighborhood. And it ranges from 30 feet to 40 feet front yard setback depending on the district of that overlay.

Midway airport, as I mentioned before, this is really just limiting building heights to either 30 feet or based on the distance that property is from the airport. And then Longwood drive, there's a photo here right below this descriptor. And this, this overlay requires both larger lots and larger front yard setbacks.

As you can see, this has a very unique character. And historic development pattern in this area with large lots, large front yard setbacks. And again, this is just identified in the zoning code, you know, by their, by their technical requirements.

So what we found though, however, was, you know, we, we started working with this community group and angle with several years ago, they had asked department to the community residents. I'd asked the department to provide more design guidelines for this area specifically for both rehabilitation and new construction. And, and, you know, we started looking at this, but we don't really currently have a tool that allows for design guidelines in an area like this that did not qualify for landmark designation.

So this is the purpose of us wanting to revise this tool and improve it so that we can add this layer of having district specific design guidelines so that there's a little bit more options and process involved in, in how these communities are modified moving forward. So, and of course, this is just a study area right now. The boundary can be modified as part of our future community engagement process.

Once this enabling legislation is passed by city council on this committee. So the goals to modify the character overlay district ordinance, we want to provide clear expectations for new construction and rehabilitation through district specific design guidelines. We want to build community consensus and involvement through the overlay designation process, as well as getting input from the community residents for the district specific design guidelines.

And then we want to make sure that DPD also can prioritize the designations of new overlay districts based on city goals and also our planning staff capacity and then new construction on really any vacant lot, but also city owned land within these new overlay districts would then need to comply with the district specific guidelines. So that would be a layered kind of development approach. So again, these are the proposed revisions.

We want to allow for district specific design guidelines for new overlay districts. We want to encourage the rehabilitation of character buildings. We will be requiring community meeting information and a summary of the residents input to be made available to the public.

And we also want to, the revision also clarifies the process for overlay boundaries that overlap multiple wards. So for new overlay districts, all of those have to be processed through a separate ordinance and DPD would still be required to notify the impact of Alderman and to coordinate with them and do public outreach with mailed noticing requirements, community meetings, and the affected wards and then review and approval by this committee and city council. So in terms of timeline, we had started work last fall with a consultant to try to analyze this tool that is.

Utilized in the name for this tool is, is kind of used differently elsewhere in other cities in the country, but, you know, we wanted to find out their best practices and research a little bit more about how best we should implement this tool for Chicago. And the consultant also identified the proposed boundaries and surveyed the proposed character buildings in our study area. And we have briefed impacted Alderman and select residents and some advocacy partners as well.

And the design guidelines template draft is, is ongoing. So of course we're here today at the hearing and then the vote at city council in the middle of October. And then we would begin to start the process for the official community meetings.

And I'm reviewing that proposed study area. Boundary reviewing the character buildings and the draft design guidelines for that example, we showed you in Inglewood. And then ideally, you know, all things go smoothly.

We would submit the legislation for that specific designation overlay by early next year. And that's the end of my presentation. I can stop sharing.

If you have any questions.

[Speaker 1] (2:04:07 - 2:04:11)
Right. Committee members Alderman Siccio Lopez.

[Speaker 5] (2:04:16 - 2:05:52)
Questions can be, I think in terms of These guidelines. I think that, you know, the department of planning spends quite a bit of resources looking at landmarking district. A lot of the times, you know, when, I mean, yesterday we had a really, you know, clear conversation about the rejection of these two in particular, especially in low income areas.

Has the department of planning has put any thought into actually looking at demolition reform and what we need to do in order for us to address demolitions, you know, have a different approach to that. I'm just really concerned about the amount of resources that we devote to landmarking in areas that, you know, Inglewood or Pilsen or other areas where homeowners are asking for support and help. A lot of these guidelines, you know, and I hear from people in Old Town and other districts that are not particularly pleased with the guidelines and the process.

I honestly have not even been briefed on kind of the guidelines or what the consultants, you know, are even discussing. But my concern is that a new team is putting a lot of energy into landmarking. When, you know, there are a lot of issues that homeowners have.

So have you looking to, you know, what we can do to address demolitions and what, I mean, I tell you right now, I think.

[Speaker 21] (2:05:52 - 2:06:03)
Chairman, point of order. Are we talking about this ordinance or is maybe. Hold on.

Hold on a second.

[Speaker 1] (2:06:04 - 2:06:09)
Chairman Wong is back on a point of information. Chairman Wong is back.

[Speaker 21] (2:06:11 - 2:06:17)
Is Alderman Ciccio referring to something in this ordinance about demolition that I missed?

[Speaker 1] (2:06:18 - 2:06:41)
Let me answer. The fact is I think Cindy in our briefings talked about that character overlay does not strictly prohibit demolitions. And I think that is where Alderman Ciccio-Lopez is going about resources and maybe demolition reform, but that's the way I see it.

[Speaker 9] (2:06:41 - 2:06:59)
You're correct, Chairman. This ordinance does not include a prevention of demolition. We're encouraging the rehabilitation of character buildings, but this tool does not prevent the demolitions.

So it's different. It's different than the landmark designation ordinance.

[Speaker 1] (2:06:59 - 2:07:22)
Right. All right. So I think Alderman Ciccio-Lopez was just talking about the abundance of resources and, you know, how we can use the ordinance that's in front of us to help communities, especially low income communities and how they can stay in their community and retain the character, I should say.

[Speaker 9] (2:07:22 - 2:08:04)
Yeah, absolutely. And I do think that's important. And for example, I think Englewood is also considered a low income community and they approached DPD, this community approached us because they wanted to have more, you know, involvement in and have design guidelines to kind of make sure that as they continue to grow their community and as investment does come into their community, that it is consistent.

And it works well with the existing kind of character that's already established and, you know, they're already proud of. Okay. Scott, are you, are you good with that?

And then can we move on?

[Speaker 21] (2:08:04 - 2:08:17)
Yeah, I just, what I thought there was something changed from the briefing that we got and what he was, Alderman Ciccio-Lopez was referring to. So I'm clear now. Thank you.

Okay. Alderman Ciccio-Lopez.

[Speaker 16] (2:08:19 - 2:08:19)
Yeah.

[Speaker 5] (2:08:19 - 2:09:14)
Thank you, Chairman. Yeah. Again, it was I think related to this because I know that the conversations about landmarking, right, revolve about demolition.

So what I was referring about is particularly, you know, when it comes to low income communities, right, where a lot of these tools are being now presented to, right. So that's what I understand, you know, this may not have to do with that, but it's relevant to the conversation. Especially, you know, today we heard at least three testimonies on residents who are really concerned about this tool in particular.

So that was, and I understand this is about, you know, betting, making it more local, like guidelines that are more tailored to specific areas. But again, I hear some concerns, you know, so in terms of the outreach, and I think what communities, I know that you have done some outreach with existing districts, right.

[Speaker 9] (2:09:14 - 2:09:21)
That's what I'm understanding. Perhaps. No, I'm sorry.

Not with existing districts. These would be proposed overlay districts.

[Speaker 5] (2:09:22 - 2:09:35)
Okay. So that's what I'm saying. So when it comes to like proposed districts, you know, are you looking in any particular districts?

Cause that, that wasn't clear. It was a proposed with new districts. I mean, so what are the issues that you're looking at?

[Speaker 9] (2:09:35 - 2:09:45)
Oh yeah. We would not change the existing overlay districts. Those were shown in purple in the first map.

And then the one that we're studying is in Inglewood. We're also studying one in Bronzeville.

[Speaker 1] (2:09:47 - 2:10:42)
And Cindy, correct me if I'm wrong, the impetus to even consider an overlay district is going to be driven by the community and the local Alderman. This is not something talk about resources. We don't have resources to go around as department heads and find out where we need special overlay districts.

But I wanted to just emphasize to the committee members that the catalyst for this is the Alderman working with their community group. And it might work well for, well, as you said in your testimony, we've already had that impetus in Englewood and certain areas of Bronzeville, but by no means are we trying to individually pick and choose what overlay districts might be appropriate for the city without the Aldermanic catalyst and community involvement, correct?

[Speaker 9] (2:10:42 - 2:10:52)
That's absolutely true. And the process for approval is through city council. So that's absolutely true.

[Speaker 1] (2:10:54 - 2:10:58)
Alderman Lopez, Ciccio Lopez, do you have other questions?

[Speaker 5] (2:10:58 - 2:11:00)
No, that's it chairman. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:11:00 - 2:11:17)
Okay. Thank you, Alderman. Let me see if I've got other hands up.

All right. If there are no further questions by committee members, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

[Speaker 50] (2:11:18 - 2:11:18)
Do pass.

[Speaker 1] (2:11:19 - 2:12:23)
Alderman Pat Dowell moves do pass as revised. Any objections to that revised motion? Revised amendment, I should say.

Hearing none. The item is passed as amended. Thank you.

Thank you. All right. We're going to take one item out of order in the morning session.

And that's because we have one of our, I think our fire commissioner people that has to leave. So we will go now to mayoral application two zero one zero, the amendment of municipal code titles two, four, five, 11, 13, 14, a 14 B 14 E 14 R 14 X 15 and 17 regarding technical corrections and adjustments related to building construction provisions. And we have acting commissioner Matt Godot from the department of buildings and others here to testify on the matter.

Matt.

[Speaker 11] (2:12:25 - 2:12:27)
Good afternoon again, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee.

[Speaker 1] (2:12:29 - 2:12:49)
I know we've got a summary for all these different sections that I'm looking at now. So I hope the members of the committee have them for questions. We have a busy agenda today, but with that being said, Matt carry on.

[Speaker 11] (2:12:50 - 2:14:10)
Sure. Yeah. Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. Again, for the record, my name is Matt Boday acting commissioner for the department of buildings. The ordinance before you contains technical corrections and adjustments to the Chicago construction codes and corresponding provisions of the municipal code of Chicago. As some of you may recall in April of 2019, the council enacted the first comprehensive revision of the Chicago building code in nearly 70 years.

Pursuant to that ordinance, those changes began phasing in last December and became mandatory for most permits applications starting on August 1st. As we continue, as we committed to you, when the ordinance passed during the phase in period, we've continued to listen to our talented and experienced building inspectors and plan reviewers, our colleagues in fire and law, and many organizations, building owners, architects, engineers, and construction professionals who work with these codes every day from their comments. We have identified some technical corrections and adjustments reflected in this ordinance.

These memos will make the construction codes clear and more concise for all users. And I'm happy to answer any questions and I do have a deputy commissioner. Grant Albrecht is also with us on the call as, as I believe, John Javorka from the fire department.

Thank you. Okay. All right.

Alderman Ray Lopez.

[Speaker 2] (2:14:12 - 2:15:00)
Thank you, chairman. And thank you again, Matt. I do have a couple of questions regarding this ordinance.

I did have a chance and I do appreciate commissioner. You reaching out to see if I had any questions to avoid last year's dustup, but I do have a quick to make two pertinent questions. First off, I noticed the number of these amendments deal with going predominantly pre 2019 or in certain cases, pre 2018.

I'm assuming those run in parallel to when the major overhaul of the codes were made. Why are we going backwards to before the code chain, the major code changes, as opposed to whatever the standard is that we set forth when the overhauls happened?

[Speaker 11] (2:15:01 - 2:15:18)
I think Grant and John could probably elaborate a little bit further, but we did identify some, I believe some issues in the, in the old code that people thought were, were good and weren't really adjust properly in the new code. But if Grant or John could elaborate further.

[Speaker 45] (2:15:18 - 2:15:31)
Yes. Good afternoon, chairman and members of the committee and chairman, Tony, we do, I think have a substitute on this. I don't know if the, there was a motion for that, but As to the right.

[Speaker 1] (2:15:32 - 2:15:48)
And let me move to accept the substitute. Do I, do I have a motion? Alderman Lopez moves to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, the substitute is accepted and in front of us. Thanks Grant.

[Speaker 45] (2:15:49 - 2:16:58)
Absolutely. And Alderman Lopez to your question. So especially in the electrical section, it was some sort of clarifications longstanding.

It's, it's not really necessarily a change, but there was some clarifying language that was in the pre 2018 electrical code that the industry was used to and asked that it be reinserted just to clarify some things that are the way we have done things in Chicago for a long time. And then there are a number of things in the pre 2019 building code. We have a lot of existing conditions.

So one thing that the pre 2019 building code allowed longer data and corridors. So we have a lot of existing longer than allowed by the model code data and corridors and existing, especially office buildings. And so recognizing that we don't want people to have to rip those out immediately.

If they're doing some minor remodeling in an office floor, we needed to add some language and we worked with BOMA Chicago and other groups to develop that language. Awesome. Thank you.

Thank you, Grant. Love the headphone, by the way.

[Speaker 2] (2:17:01 - 2:17:49)
And then a commissioner, I know we've had quite a lengthy amount of discussions in this council with regarding needing to make some fire department upgrades and improvements over the last year or so. And I see that you've made a number of new enhancements at the request of the fire department. Are there any in particular that, that are seismic in their scope and change or are they pretty much all basic and rudimentary?

I did notice. And I was surprised. I think one of the last ones in the back regarding the petroleum fire heaters, I'm assuming that is also to allow for businesses to operate outdoors now in the winter time, things of that nature.

[Speaker 11] (2:17:51 - 2:18:12)
Yes, that's correct. And a lot of our discussions that we've also had with the outdoor dining buildings of fire pointed out some portions of the old, of the current code that really wouldn't accommodate that. And I commend Grant and John Javorka working very hard together on these, these provisions.

And again, if Grant or John wish to elaborate a little bit further on those.

[Speaker 2] (2:18:13 - 2:18:39)
Well, actually commissioner before they do, it was for my colleagues edification page three of the summary of the regulations. Article six, section 59. Are there any other parts of the substitute that also will be impacting the businesses with regards to the fire department for the outdoor and outdoor dining and things of that nature?

Is this the only one?

[Speaker 11] (2:18:40 - 2:19:20)
I think there may be a couple more that Grant and John can elaborate on again. I believe it does give the fire department rulemaking authority for some of these, some of these provisions as it deals with, with fire safety and fuel gas, as opposed to, to length the tables in a menu to in the code. So I think it does give flexibility for the, the, the case by case basis on some of these outdoor dining areas, exactly what they're using geo dome versus versus tents and the like, and the close proximity to to other businesses or buildings.

But again, again, if John or grant wish to elaborate on that a little bit further.

[Speaker 45] (2:19:22 - 2:19:55)
So Grant Ulrich, again, deputy commissioner buildings with respect to outdoor dining, that provision that you identified, Alderman Lopez is really the only one that was needed. We did. I think we're very closely with BACP and the other departments, the mayor's office to provide some other guidance to businesses looking to do outdoor dining.

But that was an area where we did need to propose this code amendment to give fire authority to issue rules for the safe use of propane gas for outdoor areas.

[Speaker 2] (2:19:55 - 2:20:50)
Thank you. I think if I could make just one more recommendation to you both, is that for you and for fire is that I think we also need to look at the possibility of including waivers for tent, for tent space and restrictions as they relate to having to have 10 feet of curb space, curb space, when you allow for a tent, because in some of our tighter neighborhoods, we seem to be having an issue trying to accommodate sidewalk street and tents. If we were to try and move forward with any kind of outdoor dining situations that do not include miniature globes or whatever those other little things are for guys, you're going to do a larger scale tent.

It's almost impossible within certain neighborhoods where you have tighter streets to accommodate that. So I would recommend if we can look at that relatively quickly as we're allowing these kinds of heaters and things of that nature so that the rest of our neighborhoods could actually participate in some of these programs as well. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:20:51 - 2:21:00)
Thank you, Alderman. Thank you, Alderman. Other, other questions?

Hearing or seeing no hands up.

[Speaker 2] (2:21:03 - 2:21:08)
Let's see where we are. Moved to pass Chairman Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 1] (2:21:08 - 2:22:01)
So without further questions by committee members, Alderman Ray Lopez moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that revised or amended ordinance? Hearing no objections, the item is passed as amended.

Thank you. And while we're on that page, I'm going to, I'm going to do one more out of order because I know we're going to go back to the air quality one, which you might have a little bit more discussion on, but I'm going to move on to one landmark designation on the addendum. That's OR 2020-4114, the historical landmark designation for the former Schlitz Brewing Tide House at 9401 South Hewing Avenue.

So do we have Ms. Cavallo on?

[Speaker 14] (2:22:01 - 2:22:02)
We have Dan Klaiborne.

[Speaker 1] (2:22:02 - 2:22:03)
Oh, Dan Klaiborne. I'm sorry.

[Speaker 32] (2:22:04 - 2:24:15)
Or Klaiborne. Good afternoon. Can you hear me okay?

Yes, we can. Great. Dan Klaiborne with the Department of Planning and Development.

I'm here today with a proposed ordinance for the landmark designation of the former Schlitz Brewery Tide House constructed in 1907 and located at 9401 South Ewing Avenue. EPD staff have received the signed consent to the designation from the property's owners, Laura and Mike Medina. As you may know, brewery Tide Houses were buildings built around the turn of the last century that housed taverns that were directly owned and commissioned by larger breweries to sell only the alcohol produced by that brewer.

In part, these Tide Houses were seen as more legitimate places to consume alcohol in the face of the rising opposition to it. Back in 2011, the Landmarks Commission approved a total of nine such Tide Houses. They are depicted in front of you, including a horse stable building for landmark designation.

In 2019, the Tide House located at 9401 South Ewing Avenue was suggested to the program committee of the Chicago Landmarks Commission for landmark designation by its current owners, Mike and Laura Medina. To help orient you, the subject building is located at the Southeast corner of South Ewing Avenue and East 94th Street in the 10th Ward and Northern North portion of the East Side community area. It is located just South of the Ewing Avenue bridge that spans the Kellymet River and just to the West of the former Iroquois Steel Facility and Lake Michigan.

The Commission on Chicago Landmarks found that the proposed designation met three criteria for landmark designation, heritage, architecture, and theme, as well as a separate integrity criteria. The significant historical and architectural features of the building to be preserved are all exterior elevations, including roof lines. Both Preservation Chicago and Landmarks Illinois are in full support of the designation as well as Alderwoman Garza.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:24:22 - 2:24:57)
All right. Questions from committee members. Actually, Dan, I have a question.

In this photo here, on the, I don't know what the Ewing side, I think. So they had the original windows on that elevation there. If there was a renovation, would they, because it's been talked about various times about the cost.

If would they have to, what would they do? Do you have the original, what that looked like?

[Speaker 32] (2:25:00 - 2:25:41)
We do actually, the owners are trying to locate, there was a stained glass window that was in the, in that portion that is boarded over. And any, any, any permit for that, you know, would have to respect the, the opening that's there, of course, as well as any other, you know, materiality of a, of a new window. It wouldn't, they wouldn't necessarily have to put in the, the original stained glass window that they are actually trying to locate themselves.

They think they actually know where this window is located. But, but any, any window that would go into that opening would have, would have to respect the facade.

[Speaker 1] (2:25:42 - 2:25:47)
And then I see there's a security gates on the doors and the windows.

[Speaker 32] (2:25:48 - 2:25:59)
They could, that's no problem with landmarking. I wouldn't want to speak for my permit staff, but yes, I think that would be no problem at all to remove those gates. Yes.

Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:26:00 - 2:26:15)
All right. Any, any other questions from committee members? And we do have a letter of support from Alderman Sedlowski Garza.

So, all right. Can I get a motion?

[Speaker 36] (2:26:16 - 2:26:16)
Alderman Riley moves to pass.

[Speaker 1] (2:26:17 - 2:26:20)
Who was that Alderman? Alderman Riley.

[Speaker 7] (2:26:20 - 2:26:20)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:26:21 - 2:26:29)
So without any further questions, Alderman Riley moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that?

[Speaker 30] (2:26:30 - 2:26:30)
Cheers.

[Speaker 1] (2:26:31 - 2:27:15)
Hearing none other than cheers, the item is passed. All right. Now we're going to go back to the air quality mayoral ordinance.

Okay. Okay. So the last item on the morning agenda is mayoral application 2009, the amendment of municipal code title 17 regarding requirements associated with manufacturing and in plan manufacturing districts.

We have zoning administrator, Patrick Murphy from DPD here to testify in the matter and answer any questions. I also believe we have a substitute on this. Okay.

So before we hear from Patrick, can I get a motion to accept the substitute?

[Speaker 21] (2:27:18 - 2:27:19)
Move to accept the substitute.

[Speaker 1] (2:27:20 - 2:27:30)
Alderman Wagesback moves to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none.

The substitute is in front of us. All right, Patrick.

[Speaker 3] (2:27:32 - 2:27:51)
Thank you, chairman. Thank you. Members of the committee.

Angela, do you want to start the testimony or would you like me to start about the ordinance itself? Well, okay. I will go ahead and go into the details on the ordinance Alderman, and then I will turn it over to Angela from the mayor's office.

[Speaker 4] (2:27:51 - 2:27:56)
Actually, Patrick, we're going to go in reverse. I'm going to pull up my screen right here. If you can hear me.

[Speaker 3] (2:27:57 - 2:27:57)
Sounds good.

[Speaker 4] (2:28:03 - 2:33:13)
Okay. Thank you so much chairman Tunney and members of the zoning committee for your time today and the opportunity to discuss number 0 2 0 2 0 dash 4 5 9 0, which is an amendment to the municipal cold title 17. My name is Angela Tovar and I'm the chief sustainability officer here at the city of Chicago.

I'm going to begin today by providing you with an overview of the city's air quality reform agenda, which is important context for folks to understand the long-term commitment that this administration has made to reform. I will then turn it over to Patrick, our zoning administrator who will provide more specific details of the zoning ordinance. We will both be on hand to answer questions and we will be joined by our colleagues from CDPH who can all are also available to answer questions.

Today's zoning ordinance is part of a broader, a broader air quality reform agenda. That was announced by mayor Lightfoot and is aimed at mitigating environmental harm and air quality issues in our communities. The agenda features three short-term strategies, the zoning ordinance, which we are here to talk about today.

The air quality and health report, which was released in July and large recycling facility rules, which were enacted by CDPH in June. The long-term strategy for the reform agenda includes creation of an environmental equity working group, the revision of existing rules for demolitions, rock crushing and recycling facilities and new laws and regulations to evaluate the cumulative impact of polluting businesses, strengthening of permitting requirements over businesses who emit air pollution and reforms to the city's inspection process. Our reform agenda overall is guided by data that is outlined in CDPH's air quality and health report.

This report uses community level data and research that was conducted by CDPH to show each neighborhood's vulnerability to the effects of air pollution. I want to be clear in saying that this analysis does not just look at pollution levels and sites that cause pollution around the city. So if you're seeing areas in red, that doesn't necessarily mean that that's just one hotspot of pollution.

It also includes health and social factors to show where environmental pollution is likely to do the greatest harm. This report suggests which areas need to be prioritized when we look at efforts to reduce pollution and ensure environmental justice. While the city overall faces significant issues related to air quality, the areas of concern are communities of color, particularly on the far South, Southeast and West sides of our city, especially those that are in close proximity to major highways and concentrated industry.

I want to be clear that the zoning ordinance alone will not resolve this issue of environmental overburden that is highlighted on this map. And we as an administration will need to keep actively advancing our reform agenda forward, which is something that my colleagues and I are deeply committed to doing. This ordinance is aimed at providing a more rational and proactive approach to our zoning and planning for industrial businesses.

This proposed ordinance will impose a new independent land use review over the opening or expansion of facilities so that we can understand and mitigate any adverse impacts to ensure that the proposed development is compatible with the character of the surrounding area. The ordinance will also require a public hearing that gives stakeholders and aldermen a voice in the placement of intensive sites in their neighborhood. This is something that is not in existence right now.

So to summarize the proposed ordinance, it eliminates certain uses from the city limits, including mining landfills and incinerators permanently closing the doors on these types of facilities. It reclassifies certain uses from outright to special use, which requires a more stringent review process, and it requires plan development review and approval for most large industrial land uses. If they are within 660 feet of a residential business or commercial district, or if the site exceeds 10 acres, it's important for us to mention that this ordinance was developed with feedback from elected officials, environmental groups, and industry groups.

We believe that the city of Chicago is on a path toward more equitable economic growth. And this is a way in which we can create a mindful process that prioritizes the health and safety of our residents, workers, and other community stakeholders. With that said, I'm going to turn it over to Patrick Murphy who will walk you through the ordinance in more detail.

[Speaker 3] (2:33:17 - 2:33:26)
Hi, thank you, Angela. Chairman. Can you hear me?

Hello?

[Speaker 4] (2:33:27 - 2:33:27)
I can hear you.

[Speaker 3] (2:33:29 - 2:34:28)
Sorry. I'm having some technology difficulties in my office. So good afternoon, chairman and members of the committee for the record.

My name is Patrick Murphy with the department of planning and development. As Angela said, I'm here to discuss the proposed changes to certain sections of the Chicago municipal code as they relate to the elimination of certain manufacturing based land uses, adjustments of the legislative review process and use standards associated with certain manufacturing based land uses and modifications to retail activities allowed in manufacturing zoning districts in the city of Chicago. I'd first like to note that there's a substitute ordinance, which was discussed before.

And I'd like the committee to accept the substitute for consideration today. The substitute addresses the erroneous typographical exclusion from the original ordinance amendment that was introduced by now assigning container storage, freight terminals, and outdoor storage of raw materials as a principal use as being subject to plan development triggers.

[Speaker 50] (2:34:28 - 2:34:45)
Excuse me, Mr. Chairman. Yes. Yes.

Sorry to interrupt Patrick. Are you able to expand your screen so that or enlarging the print? I can't even read that and I can't expand it.

[Speaker 1] (2:34:47 - 2:34:49)
By the way, Patrick, we accepted the substitute.

[Speaker 3] (2:34:50 - 2:34:57)
All right. Thank you, sir. Angela or Lucia, could you maybe zoom it in by half and then I could walk through if there's questions on specific line items.

[Speaker 4] (2:35:09 - 2:35:18)
I don't think I have the, I don't have the ability to do that. I can, what we can do it, would it be okay if we email the Alderman a copy of the ordinance?

[Speaker 3] (2:35:20 - 2:35:23)
Yes. And I Alderman, we can also get to a summary that has that chart in it.

[Speaker 1] (2:35:27 - 2:35:48)
I believe we've already, I think we've already sent it to Alderman Dow as to all the other committee members, but she might not have it there in her printed copy in her office. Pat, you want us to resend it to you?

[Speaker 50] (2:35:52 - 2:35:55)
No, Mr. Chairman. That's all right.

[Speaker 1] (2:35:55 - 2:36:02)
Well, let's walk through, let's walk through line by line with this Patrick. When we go through it's not, it's only one page if I'm not mistaken.

[Speaker 3] (2:36:03 - 2:36:04)
Yes, sir. Correct.

[Speaker 59] (2:36:05 - 2:36:05)
Okay.

[Speaker 3] (2:36:06 - 2:36:07)
I can do that.

[Speaker 59] (2:36:07 - 2:36:08)
Okay.

[Speaker 3] (2:36:08 - 2:38:49)
Okay. I'll, I'll proceed. I'll go, I'll go through some details and then yes, we can go through the chart line by line if we, if we need to or talk about some specifics.

So the zoning details as reflected in the proposed substitute or ordinance amendment are designed to focus as follows. One, the elimination of mining excavation, public and private incinerators, sanitary landfills, and daycare uses from various manufacturing and plan manufacturing districts to her intensive manufacturing production and industrial services, container storage, freight movement, certain recycling classifications, windrow composting, warehousing, wholesaling, freight terminals and the outdoor storage of raw materials as a principal use.

All proposals will require a mandatory special use with intensive manufacturing production, industrial services, container storage, freight terminals, certain recycling classifications, as they're shown in the bottom of that list, windrow composting and the outdoor storage of raw materials as a principal use also triggering an automatic plan development. If their site exceeds 10 acres, or if they're located within 660 feet of a residential business, commercial or parks and open space district. Conversely, if a type one zoning map amendment is proposed for certain sensitive uses, such as residential daycare, hospital parks and open space school, restaurant with an outdoor patio or other outdoor assembly uses.

And it will be within 660 feet of the previously listed intensive industrial uses. Those items shown on the chart, then such uses are subject to special use review and approval, unless they otherwise trigger a plan development. Finally, regarding retail activities in manufacturing districts, we're proposing to limit the general public's access to products produced by site to the lesser of 20% of the gross floor area or 3000 square feet.

Today, such 3000 square foot cap does not exist for sales of products, not produced on site, whether in a manufacturing or planned manufacturing district, the general public will be precluded from entry and allowed space will only be regulated by the 20% gross floor area calculation. Thank you again, chairman and members of the committee. And I'm happy to answer any questions about those details or that chart.

[Speaker 1] (2:38:53 - 2:39:32)
All right. Well, let me, let me ask a couple of questions while I don't see a hand up yet. And again, most of my colleagues, if not all of them were on the, on the call, um, my question was, uh, currently, and this is probably Angela, um, obviously, uh, landfills would be strictly prohibited in the city if this passed.

Um, and currently we don't have any landfills. So what do we do as Chicagoans with all the material, where does it go?

[Speaker 4] (2:39:35 - 2:40:35)
Um, that is right, chair. Thank you for that question. Um, like most major cities across the country, Chicago does export its waste.

We have landfilling, we contract with landfilling facilities outside of the city. Um, as the chief sustainability officer, I will say, and I, and I, I believe that this is a, um, this is a value that's shared amongst this administration. Um, we have to do better and we are in the process of looking at a comprehensive waste study to better understand how we can divert more, um, how we can recycle better and how investments in reuse is a growing economy and could potentially be a job generator for the city of Chicago.

Um, we will be sharing additional information about that study as it becomes available, but we certainly cannot just continue to rely on, um, landfilling and business as usual when it comes to our waste.

[Speaker 1] (2:40:37 - 2:41:22)
All right. My second question is we have a fair amount of witnesses and or letters about warehousing, um, specifically as a sub, uh, category that, uh, whether it's an expansion of an additional or a new facility or a spec facility that doesn't really have tenants yet. Um, and their concern is, um, generally before it's been by right.

Um, and they would like to see that less intensive. That's all in the eyes of the beholder, um, to be by right and not special use. So would you be able to talk about that one, either Patrick or Angela?

[Speaker 3] (2:41:25 - 2:43:16)
I mean, I'm happy, uh, chairman, this is Patrick. I'm happy to go through some of the, uh, discussions or the internal analysis we've done about that, uh, about those zoning legislative distinctions. Um, the long and the short of it is a lot of these facilities, uh, the TDL facilities already either trigger a plan development under some of the scenarios absent the PMD, uh, because of their size or there are many of them that are already located or were planned to be located within plan manufacturing districts and would trigger a plan development because of their proximity to a regulated waterway.

Though. So, so the, the criteria on those uses would not change under this scenario, the benefit to those operators, especially the ones that are doing from the spec standpoint is that a plan development does not require the disclosure of tenancy and doesn't go into the, uh, uniquely specific operational details that the zoning board would want to see. And so in a lot of these cases, these TDL facilities, while they will have a legislative process, they'll have to go through where they did not in some cases before, they won't have the additional step of needing to require or needing to disclose operators that they may not have under contract and might not for a number of years.

I would just add that the PD triggers that we are now proposing for the plan development zoning districts mirror the requirements that already exist in the M district today. So while we are including additional regulations about the proximity to certain sensitive uses, there were already proximity requirements in the M district and the size triggers are simply being repeated from what's already required today in the M districts as well.

[Speaker 1] (2:43:18 - 2:43:48)
Okay. Um, I, I failed to mention that, um, there are co-sponsors on the, on the air quality ordinance. That's, uh, Alderman Rodriguez Cardenas and Sedlowski Garza.

Um, I know Alderman Rodriguez is a member of the committee, so I didn't see your hand up, Mike. Um, I don't know whether you wanted to, uh, speak on the ordinance or you're still on the call.

[Speaker 41] (2:43:49 - 2:43:51)
Yeah, chairman. I'm on, can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (2:43:52 - 2:43:53)
Correct. Okay.

[Speaker 41] (2:43:53 - 2:45:10)
So Mike, you're, you're a co-sponsor on this and a member of the committee. Um, sure. And you know, I'm, I'm, I, uh, I'm may, uh, ask some questions later, but I did want to, uh, um, you know, thank, uh, Patrick Murphy and Angela for, you know, talking with folks.

I think that in, in my case, you know, I, I, there's some things in this, uh, ordinance that I would have preferred to gone farther on, but, um, on any of these endeavors, um, you know, compromise is important. Um, but I think this is a good first step forward. Um, I think, you know, considering the number of, uh, environmental issues that we have in our city and the real demand from advocates to speak to those issues, I think it's, you know, high time that we take these steps forward.

Uh, they seem to be very practical steps, very pragmatic steps in my opinion, um, and lay the framework for a good moving forward in our zoning codes. Um, I think we need to have more community input and dialogue when it comes to these types of developments. And, uh, that's why I'm supportive of this ordinance and, and, and, uh, we'll get into the details in this, in the next set of questions.

Thank you chairman for the opportunity to speak. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:45:11 - 2:45:38)
Alderman. Um, I see a committee members, uh, with their hands up and I'll start in the order of Marie Haddon, uh, Raymond Lopez, and then Byron Sicho Lopez followed by Patrick Thompson. Um, but I do want to say to Angela, I see Patrick is on the call.

I think there was a question. I'm sure he's going to bring it up. Did you get in touch with the stockyards, uh, industrial people?

[Speaker 4] (2:45:38 - 2:45:48)
No, I did not. I, I reached out to Alderman Thompson and asked for a contact, but I was unable to get that information in time for this hearing.

[Speaker 12] (2:45:49 - 2:45:49)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (2:45:49 - 2:46:00)
I just wanted, cause I was part of that, uh, part of that discussion and I see his hand up and I'm, I know he's going to go down that road. Uh, all right. Uh, Alderwoman Haddon.

[Speaker 15] (2:46:00 - 2:46:34)
Thank you, chair. Um, thank you, Angela and Patrick. Um, my, my first question is actually just a clarification on the substitute language and, and you guys said it, I just need you to say it again for me, um, to, to make sure, uh, where that falls in.

So the, the substitute now includes right. The, the warehouses, uh, wholesaling and freight movements to, to be subject to a plan development review. That is, am I, did I understand that correctly as opposed to the ZBA process or did I get it back?

[Speaker 3] (2:46:34 - 2:47:03)
Uh, this is Patrick. So no, Alderman, that's, that's incorrect. So the alternate is, is what happened.

The warehousing and wholesaling and freight movement uses will only be subject to a, um, special use with the revision, the container storage freight terminal and outdoor storage of raw materials as a principal use will only will now be subject to potentially a PD if they are of large enough scale.

[Speaker 15] (2:47:03 - 2:47:07)
Gotcha. And that's where the size or mentioned, uh, would trigger that.

[Speaker 3] (2:47:07 - 2:47:30)
Right. The, the, the reference I was making about the plan development trigger is that if some of these, uh, warehousing operations, for instance, which is what a lot of these TDL facilities are otherwise known as are established along or adjacent to a protected waterway, then that would be a plan development trigger that is separate and apart from that. But that's a rule that already exists today, independent of this ordinance.

[Speaker 15] (2:47:30 - 2:48:33)
Thank you for that clarification. So then, uh, my, my follow-up there and, um, you know, this is not my area of expertise, but thankfully we have a, a lot of folks who, who are, um, experts and, and, uh, directly impacted by this in communities around Chicago. And, and so, um, you know, some of, some of those residents have expressed concerns that this avenue does not provide significant enough protections, environmental protection specifically for residents.

And I'm wondering if you guys could, could speak to that. So, um, you know, they've, they've talked about how the plan development review, um, has already built into, um, just a lot more protections, um, you know, explicitly requiring minimization of exposure to noxious materials, for example, and you know, what through this alternate process that you're proposing, um, will that look like? What are the environmental protections built in that are going to help our communities?

And that question is for Patrick or Angela.

[Speaker 4] (2:48:35 - 2:50:35)
Sure. I can start. And I think that, um, you know, Patrick or, or CDPH can jump in.

Um, I will say that I acknowledge the concerns of the community related to the impacts of warehousing as a sector, right. Um, especially because it's truck dependent. We have to think about that, especially as that's an emerging economy here in the city.

That's something to consider. Um, we, I will say that, um, the, the, um, the plan development is only, um, as Patrick mentioned, right. That we're only talking about if the facility is within a PMD, which is already zoned for heavy industry.

It's the opinion of this administration, um, that a traffic management plan, which would be coordinated as part of the ZBA process, um, and also review of the facility by CDPH, um, could result in sort of the same pollution control and traffic management measures among other considerations. Um, so we do feel like we do have the appropriate measures internally through the ZBA process to raise up and mitigate some of those concerns. Um, we will, we will be, and we will be addressing it through that effort.

Um, I will also say that this administration is working with the industry, um, just given that it has been identified, um, in our recovery report as a central piece of our economic growth. Um, we're already working with this industry to think about more sustainability measures, such as vehicle electrification, and also, um, thinking about, um, the reuse of their, um, you know, these are buildings with large footprints. So how could we activate them for solar?

Um, I think it's another opportunity for us to consider. So I would say that, yes, this is, um, this is the first start of many, um, parts of the pieces of the reform agenda that will come forward that will address these issues. And if you look at them collectively, um, I think that they will provide a tremendous impact on our communities.

[Speaker 15] (2:50:35 - 2:51:20)
That's helpful. And that, that brings me to, I guess, the second question, as you talk about, um, the ZBA process and, and what we, what we kind of are going to look to measure, um, is part of that process will be, will we be taking kind of baseline air quality measures, um, to have something to compare to? Um, so whether that's, you know, I, taking measurements of, of kind of these current places that we have mapped out, um, but even through a specific process, right.

When someone's going through that special use permit process, um, or even for a new facility, will that include taking some of those baseline measurements so we can really track the impact of a, of a before and after, when there are changes involved.

[Speaker 4] (2:51:26 - 2:51:31)
I'm going to ask my colleagues at CDPH to answer that question. All the women have them.

[Speaker 25] (2:51:31 - 2:53:47)
Um, Sure. Uh, good afternoon, Dave Graham, assistant commissioner with, uh, and I don't have a video, sorry. Uh, assistant commissioner, uh, public health.

I oversee environmental permitting and inspections. Um, I think moving, we'll not think, uh, the discussion moving forward is, uh, CDPH has been involved in a variety of air air monitoring. So there are, there's a limited number of, of sensors that are up in the city.

And, uh, those are following US EPA guidelines on how you cite them because buildings and, uh, adjacent to, uh, distance from buildings, height to buildings all impact what those measurements, uh, how those measurements are used in the, and those are strictly used for enforcement. So as we move forward and continue working on a variety of, uh, of, uh, technologies that are out there, such as satellites, NASA has satellites that they're able to evaluate, um, air quality. Those are things we will try to incorporate and look into the issue with, uh, doing air monitoring at a specific site.

Um, there are a variety of issues. Uh, there could be offsite impacts that could, could be, uh, a concern. Um, the wind direction, uh, seasonally changes.

So going out and doing air sampling, it's, it's, it's a challenge. And it's something I think that we'll, we'll look to, to, to see how we can measure an impact in a neighborhood. So we are specifically thinking about that.

And it's going to be part of a broader evaluation of how, how, how, how can you take, how can you evaluate a business and then quantitatively determine what that impact would be. So those are things we're looking at.

[Speaker 15] (2:53:48 - 2:55:13)
Um, thanks, Mr. Graham. And I reckon going back to, to budget season last year and hearing that, uh, we were pretty behind, um, from CDPH on monitoring air quality. And I find this response, especially given the topic we're discussing deeply unsatisfying.

Um, it's, I can understand the difficulties and a lot of what you've explained, makes sense on not necessarily being able to attribute or pinpoint right. Um, certain problems. However, um, it didn't answer the question of whether I guess maybe you did.

Um, it sounds like we don't have any, anything that's included in this process. Um, as we're moving forward, we've named this ordinance, like an air quality ordinance, even though it's a zoning ordinance. Um, but it doesn't seem to actually have built in enough actions to allow us as council members, you as departments or our residents, um, to accurately and adequately like track what improvements or, or, um, you know, negative impacts these things might have on air quality.

So I'll say I would look for you guys to come with a little more than that. With, um, CDPH specifically, um, for air quality monitoring, I'll just say, I don't want to monopolize the time. So I have one more piece.

Um, we can follow up on air quality plans from CDPH later. Um, the last piece is really.

[Speaker 4] (2:55:15 - 2:56:17)
If it warrants it, I will also add that CDPH can apply additional special conditions. And that's what I think that the important thing is. So I think Dave in describing what, what he described talks about how difficult it would be to, um, establish this baseline, right.

Given some of the changes and just wind flow and other challenges related to air quality, we certainly have measures in the city already. And I think that if it warrants it, right, if there is, um, a piece of equipment or a deep concern around, um, air quality related to a specific proposed development, um, CDPH does have the authority to apply special conditions, um, which would include monitors. So that is a possibility.

I think that the important thing to say is we have to go through this review process to understand that right now there's this process doesn't exist. And we will not know unless we do an intake of the facility, what additional requirements are necessary to address that measure. Um, so I just wanted to add that.

[Speaker 25] (2:56:17 - 2:56:52)
And so quickly, uh, just to, uh, I responded to your question like exactly, but as Angela was saying, if we've got a business that's coming in and we've got a concern about real or perceived issues, as far as dust, we, with our new rules, the larger cycling rules, there are, uh, requirements for air monitoring with, uh, with the Southeast side, we have air monitoring. And so that at the time when we meet with folks, we will, if, if we need to, we will make sure that, um, we will apply some type of air monitoring. So I apologize for answering your question fully.

[Speaker 15] (2:56:52 - 2:57:31)
No, you know, and I'm sorry if I didn't understand it. I felt like it was a yes, no question. Um, Angela, your response was, was helpful.

Um, so my, my last question there, um, uh, could you speak a little bit, I know we've got co-sponsors and so maybe, um, my colleague Alderman Rodriguez can speak to this, but I guess from, from Angela and Patrick, um, as well, what was the commute, what was the process for this? Um, so especially seeing those maps in your presentation, we have residents living in places that are severely impacted, right by this, by changes. And, uh, hopefully they'll benefit from some of the improvements that you're making.

How were they involved, um, in the decision-making and the planning for this?

[Speaker 4] (2:57:37 - 3:00:15)
Um, so this process was about six months long, as some of this work predates me, um, in my role here at the city. Um, but this was certainly something that I thought was important to pick up and to look forward, um, as part of our broader sustainability agenda. Um, the work started internally as a conversation, um, just acknowledging the, especially, um, after the, the analysis by CDPH and the understanding that we have to address and mitigate, um, both environmental harm and air quality.

Um, so some of this is a conversation of departments coming together and acknowledging that there is an issue here and that there can be, um, um, a multi-departmental effort, right? There are different lovers that we can utilize, uh, to address this issue, zoning being one of them. So this work comes out of, um, you know, leadership from the mayor's office, from zoning, from CDPH, and other departments coming together, um, to, um, you know, create this ordinance, um, which, you know, the mayor, um, announced in July.

In addition to that, it was important for us to socialize. Um, and I will say that this is, um, this, there are concerns on both sides, right? There are concerns with industry folks who feel that this doesn't go, um, that goes too far and that there are concerns, there are concerns from environmental groups that don't, that think that this doesn't go far enough.

Um, you know, we try to land in a place where we acknowledge those deep concerns. We don't want to minimize anybody's concerns, right? Um, they're valid.

Um, on one end, the industry is concerned about jobs and the growing economy on the other end. Um, we have people that have deep concerns about air quality and environmental harm. In a perfect world, those should not be in conflict, right?

Um, we should be able to do both. And I think that this is what this ordinance tries to achieve. Um, but we did have engagement.

We continue to have engagement, um, with groups, um, industry groups with environmental groups, with elected officials on this issue. Um, this is a, this is a dialogue that will continue as we move forward, um, with other pieces of this ordinance as well. Um, I have not created.

We, we another step forward for us is that we do intend on creating an environmental equity working group. We want stakeholders to come to the table. You know, this isn't a one and done ordinance.

Um, this is a continued dialogue and we want to build off of this, right? There's a tremendous amount of opportunity for us to get this right. Um, and to explore the best possible outcomes for our communities.

And, and I think that that's what we're committed to do doing here. And this is sort of the introduction of one of many ordinances that would come forward as a part of this reform agenda.

[Speaker 15] (3:00:15 - 3:00:20)
Thank you so much, everyone for answering my questions. Um, thanks Angela for the time and thank you chair.

[Speaker 1] (3:00:21 - 3:00:25)
All right. All the men, uh, Ciccio Lopez.

[Speaker 5] (3:00:27 - 3:02:16)
Thank you, uh, chairman. And, um, yeah, I think that, um, all the men, all the women had in cover some of the questions that I, uh, had, um, my question goes, um, in line with, uh, some of the reservations that I think were pointed out here, um, in terms of the, the, uh, the zoning board of appeals as being the place where decisions are, are made. Um, I, I think that there's like several inconsistencies here in terms of why this body that is an unelected body, um, that is appointed by the mayor will, uh, have the, the, the, the set.

So in this kind of process, because my concern in terms of, um, on the, and I think we heard a little bit about the, the impact is that, you know, traffic management, for instance, right. That doesn't cover, um, health impacts, right. That just doesn't, doesn't cover that.

Um, when it comes to a monitoring and other, other measures, um, I don't think that that's the proper body one, uh, to analyze these. And, and, uh, I hear also that there will be a working group, but the working group doesn't seem to have any decision making ability. So, um, I do think that that's my first question as in terms of why, why is this body, the body that was decided to legislate on a matter, um, you know, to me that, you know, it goes back to, you know, we should reestablish the department of the environment.

That's where it should be happening so that we can legislate. But, um, you know, it seems to me that this is, this is a big issue, um, that I think that I want to bring to your attention. You know, why is this body was selected for these decisions?

[Speaker 3] (3:02:19 - 3:04:37)
Uh, Alderman, I'm, I'm here. This is Patrick Murphy. I'm happy to respond on some of that, uh, some of the thinking behind the designation between the special use and the plan development.

Uh, currently the zoning board already has authorities over a number of the uses that are referenced or included in this ordinance. There are already a number of intensive industrial uses in plan manufacturing districts and manufacturing districts that trigger special uses that are required, that require them to go before a hearing to the zoning board of appeals. So in one sense, we are carrying forward and expanding some of that authority, but carrying forward the same reasons and the same, uh, review process that we're using for certain intensive industrial uses and adding additional items to that list under the review authority, the ZBA that they already have.

And then secondarily, we already have a number of threshold triggers in the zoning code that differentiate various scales of development. And if you exceed a certain size, typically it's acreage, then you are automatically required to become a plan development. So we took some of those previous triggers, particularly those that relate to M district properties, which are in certain proximity to residential uses.

And we applied them or we're proposing to apply them to the same set of uses in the PMD, in order to give the city the ability to be more involved in the planning for these sites to help with the mitigation efforts for these neighborhoods and to help make neighborhoods aware of the projects that are coming in. Yes, the zoning exists there and there's residential and other lesser intensive uses in close proximity, but because of the, as of right nature that exists, there's often a far less amount of awareness as far as the types of projects and the city is far more restricted in being able to help regulate and provide benefits to the community, dealing with truck traffic, dealing with, uh, pollution, monitorization, dealing with hours of operation. Those are the types of, uh, uh, conditions that the zoning board of appeals, or even through a plan development can be established on these projects.

And we really looked at the difference between the two legislative routes as a matter of how we treat projects currently. And we try to apply that going forward with the same set of logic.

[Speaker 35] (3:04:38 - 3:04:39)
Yeah.

[Speaker 5] (3:04:39 - 3:07:28)
And Mr. Murphy does exactly what my concern is. Um, of course, you know, as you know, and judging by what has happened, you know, you know, Hill called, you know, iron and others, you know, uh, the city doesn't have particularly a good record of, um, uh, on the environment. So to expand authority on something that is not working and it's not working because the proper agencies are not involved.

I do think that the department of health, I think that we should do definitely more than having, um, one, uh, sustainability officer in the department of environment. There's a lot more here, uh, Mr. Murphy that just, um, you know, just a simple, uh, process, um, to create a perception that we are betting this. I mean, we're talking about community effects impact, right.

And monitoring, I think that wasn't already brought up. Um, there's a lot of, a lot of measures. There's a lot of things that are not including in this.

Um, and I just, you know, I never, I mean, so that you can see, just just now we, we, we, um, uh, just appoint a chair that seems to be very close to the administration talking about independence of the zoning board of appeals. There's different measures that makes me feel very, um, and also the lack of, uh, on engagement with the legislative branch. This is a, um, this is a change that is needed.

Absolutely. But the process and where the ultimately where we're going to legislate to ensure that these decisions are made with all the factors, you know, that we haven't talked about the community impact effects. We probably going to actually get reductions.

We haven't talked about it. I mean, we said, well, let's talk after the fact about a monitoring let's talk about after the fact involvement of the department of health. Um, I don't think that the zoning board of appeals is the proper venue for these discussions to happen.

I don't think that we should, you know, um, expand, you know, on the, on a, on a process that is not working. We absolutely agree on the need to, uh, address and change, you know, given the multiple scandals that keep coming. Um, my concern is that this is simply not the proper venue.

Uh, and I think that we need to make sure that we as a legislative branch, uh, start legislating to make sure that we have a department of health, uh, department of the environment, uh, that have the, the experts on the field that need to be betting these, these, uh, these, um, these kinds of projects. I, again, I, my reservation, I'm a big objection is on the process. Uh, and this seems to me like a power grab by the executive.

[Speaker 1] (3:07:29 - 3:07:33)
Thank you. Um, Alderman Alderman Ray Lopez.

[Speaker 2] (3:07:36 - 3:10:18)
Thank you, chairman, uh, members of the committee. I actually, uh, I'm a little bit upset with my colleague, uh, Alderman Ciccio Lopez for, I think stealing half my speech, but I give him credit because I think a great minds think alike. This is very much a power grab.

I'm not fooled by the title of this ordinance or that's PowerPoint because this has nothing to do with pollution. This has to do with yet again, another attempt by this administration to wrestle authority and control away from Alderman who are the elected representatives of the neighborhoods to help have an opinion to help craft and protect the neighborhoods that they were elected to represent. That is what this is.

You could have labeled this rainbows and unicorns, and I still would not support this because that is not what this is about. The fact that we have, that we are told that there are surveys that we're aren't even ready for us to discuss the impact and we're being told that we have to rush this forward is insulting. This is not about creating jobs.

This is about taking authority away from Alderman for weakening our position even further. That's what this is about. This was not a public discussion.

And the fact that there is still industry individuals who are not satisfied with this tells me that we are rushing forward to fit, to accomplish the agenda of the mayor and not necessarily what's in the best interest for this city. This will chase jobs out of our neighborhoods. This will chase jobs out of this city, all because we are going to delay how we build upon the successes that made this city, what it is.

The point that my colleague Alderman Sitio Lopez made is a hundred percent inaccurate. You expect this council to believe that bureaucrats at city hall are somehow going to take our neighborhoods seriously and protect them? Hillco was a failure twice by this administration.

We see now this week that the administration is apologizing to one of the sponsors for not failing to notify them about what was going on in their neighborhoods. And this is an administration who has all the levers of power city hall has to offer. You are going to overburden the zoning board of appeals with all of these special use permits moving forward.

Does anyone know how many parcels would be impacted throughout the city of Chicago that would be forced to apply in this process?

[Speaker 1] (3:10:19 - 3:10:48)
So Alderman Ray Lopez, you're asking the question about the number that would be impacted. So I know you are speaking a lot. I want to get to the Q and a, and then you can, we'll get one question, our committee members, and then we'll get back to you.

Okay. But specifically on the impact of the potential applications, I think Patrick, you and I discussed this. You want to opine on this one?

[Speaker 3] (3:10:51 - 3:12:56)
Yes. So Alderman, there's a couple of things. We'll get a map up here first of all, that will show you the areas of the city that are impacted by the ordinance and what that represents in an acreage standpoint compared to the city as a whole, the zoning districts that would be impacted.

It would be hard to sit here and say exactly how many applications that might lead that might lead to, because in a lot of these cases, there are large scale facilities and they may represent multiple parcels of property. So I wouldn't be able to guess at the amount of ZBA activity. This could trigger.

However, I would say that the quantity of these applications is relatively minor compared to the overall scope of what the ZBA reviews, be it variations dealing with single family residences and business licenses of a non-industrial nature. And there's essentially a very minimal of any backload right now in the ZBA. It's about, it's about a one month to two month wait.

That is overwhelmingly the cause caused by the cannabis applications of which we are working our way through. So I don't perceive this as an overburden overburdening request, overburdensome requests on the ZBA, either on its staff or on the agenda itself. And as soon as we get the map up, I'll show you exactly what this covers in the city.

So the, the, the, the different, the color variations on the legend represent the zoning districts involved and the square footage chart on the bottom represents the quantity of the city that would be subject to an aspect of this ordinance. I would also add that it doesn't necessarily mean that all of this square footage would be subject to either a plan development or a special use. Some may vary between the two because of the size or scale or type of use involved.

So it may not be, it will, it will not be. I know that it will not be every square foot involved ends up at the zoning board of appeals simply because there are other plan development triggers that are a part of this ordinance and that already exists today, which a lot of these projects fall under.

[Speaker 2] (3:12:57 - 3:13:05)
So then if it's that easy to know what that many of them will be not participating, how is it? We don't know how many would be impacted.

[Speaker 3] (3:13:07 - 3:13:46)
Well, all I, all I what I meant was that when we look at the various projects that come in currently under the M and the PMG zoning, there are an overwhelming number of them are of a large scale variety in the manufacturing districts, for instance, they are of a larger scale and there are already PD triggers that exist, which we are then mirroring in the P in the PMD. So I do, I could not tell you how many projects would be subject to this or could be subject to this, but I do know that, that I, I say it with great confidence that there is not going to be a 100% zoning board of appeals application of this square footage and use table. That's these projects don't evolve on, on that, on that level historically.

[Speaker 2] (3:13:49 - 3:14:13)
So chairman, the question, since that's what you want, then what is the actual real world problem that this ordinance seeks to correct? Because it seems as though this ordinance is offering a solution to a problem that we haven't yet, it hasn't yet materialized. What is the actual real world issue that this would address that we've missed up until this point?

[Speaker 1] (3:14:15 - 3:15:26)
Well, I'm going to say this we have three co-sponsors, one of which is our committee member and the mayoral introduction, just as listening as I have from the briefings and such, there's obviously an air quality problem around our PMDs. There's issues about the impact on, on the neighborhoods and that surround them. And there, as you noted in your comments, there's concern about the industry retaining growing industries from where warehousing all the way to heavy industrial.

So as was, was Angela said this is the first in a series of steps to try to protect communities from the environmental end. And then there's, we have heard from the industrial end about their concerns. And I think Mike Rodriguez, all of them Rodriguez talked about this has been a balancing act and more to come, but I appreciate your, your comment.

If any, any of the departments want to opine more on it, feel free.

[Speaker 2] (3:15:26 - 3:15:49)
Well, respectfully chairman, that didn't answer the question, other than saying that because of the three sponsors, that this would have answered their questions. So does that mean that this would have resolved Hilco? If this were in place, would this have resolved general iron?

If this were in place, would this have resolved Matt asphalt from McKinley park? If this were in place, is that what the answer is?

[Speaker 1] (3:15:50 - 3:16:12)
Well, let me, let me, let me ask the department. I think if these were in an order, we probably would have had more control over the expansion and the development uses moving forward. So, but who from the departments want to answer Alderman Beals or not Alderman Lopez's question.

[Speaker 3] (3:16:13 - 3:16:44)
This is Patrick Murphy. I can handle some of the zoning aspects of it. The, the Hilco project was a plan development.

So that would have followed that would have followed the same legislative track. And actually the Hilco project would not be impacted by this as it's in a C zoning district, which, which predated the plan development. So then this would not have impacted Hilco.

Correct. Correct. There already is a legislative cycle for the PD that a legislative trigger for the plan development that this fell under.

[Speaker 2] (3:16:45 - 3:16:50)
That's fine. That's what I'm trying to get at. So then what about general iron in the 10th ward?

[Speaker 3] (3:16:51 - 3:17:03)
General iron was, was a special use and would have triggered a planned development or what could have triggered a plan development had this ordinance been in place.

[Speaker 2] (3:17:05 - 3:17:08)
Okay. And Matt trucking or asphalt.

[Speaker 3] (3:17:08 - 3:17:26)
That was established by right that depending on the acreage could have triggered a plan development, but certainly based on their proximity to residential zoning, it would have triggered a plan development under this ordinance. Yes, sir.

[Speaker 9] (3:17:28 - 3:17:29)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (3:17:29 - 3:17:37)
Can I move? I want to move on to, Hey, you can come back. I want to move to Patrick Thompson.

[Speaker 8] (3:17:37 - 3:17:43)
Uh, thank you, chairman. Can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (3:17:43 - 3:17:44)
We can.

[Speaker 8] (3:17:45 - 3:27:18)
Okay. Uh, first I just, um, I can find my questions and comments to the ordinance, but I do have to say something to Angela. Um, you know, we're in this business.

Our reputations mean a lot for you to get up and just blatantly make a false statement about trying to reach out to me and me, not getting back to you regarding the stockyards. You gotta be very careful. I spoke to you, to Dan, Larry, to Samir, and to Patrick Murphy for an hour and a half last night.

You told me you talked to Craig Chico from the stockyards. So please, please don't do that. Okay.

Chairman. Thank you. The members, my colleagues who've sponsored this, I understand the gist of what we're trying to accomplish and what many of you, uh, are trying, which we all want to see.

Better quality of life in the city. That's the environment, the air quality and understanding how we want to work together to improve that for all Chicagoans. However, there are certain aspects of this ordinance that I believe will hurt the quality of life in the city by moving jobs outside of the city, by limiting our abilities in the city.

Many folks in the city, uh, at the department of planning and development in the law department spent hours. Some of my colleagues who are on the city council were a part of that. When they created plan manufacturing districts, which were to provide a buffer between the industrial uses and the residential.

And that gave the residents a comfort that the industrial was going to be in a specific area. It gave the industrial also the certainty and assurance that they need from a business perspective to be able to operate their businesses, knowing that if they bought a piece of property to invest, that they would be able to operate. There's no aldermanic prerogative on that.

There's no bureaucracy. It's as of right. That's why we painstakingly drafted these districts and created these districts.

Industrial right now is the hottest market that's keeping Chicago moving forward. Yes, with e-commerce, there's more warehousing and distribution. By creating a developer who's coming into the PMD, as I said, does it as a right to create a, especially use will only delay the process, create the uncertainty and less deter developers and industrial users from coming in.

Furthermore, the as the zoning board process is a, in a sense of many trial, you have to go out and procure expert testimony. There are standards that are required that need to be met by the zoning board and the expense to go through that. Especially if you're a, a small user, we have a lot of buildings in the stockyards, industrial, uh, planned manufacturing district that have multi multi-tenanted properties.

Some of these are smaller users, a couple thousand square feet, a coffee roaster, for example, they would have to go to the zoning board of appeals and obtain a special use to go operate their small wholesale business. That's not good for Chicago. That's not good for business.

Furthermore, we talk about having this oversight and why, why this is so necessary in the M and PMD districts. Those are the districts that we've created for manufacturing. And in the conversations I've had, the concerns were about traffic.

Then the concern was about environmental and air quality. And that target kept moving as to what we're trying to solve for. But I can tell you in manufacturing and planned manufacturing districts and manufacturing districts, which are away from the residential, what's closer to the residential are commercial districts.

If you were to build a warehouse distribution and logistics building, which is as of right in a commercial district, you'll still be able to do that under the current zoning code. This only affects the manufacturers and the PMDs. It doesn't affect the commercial districts.

Those are even closer to the residents that we're trying to solve the air quality for, but it's also the air quality for all the workers and people. I've grown up in my neighborhood with an industrial park around us where we have a lot of uses. And I get it.

If we want to go back and take a look at some of the heavier uses, not the warehouse distribution, but the asphalt plant, we had slaughterhouses here. Not many are left. But those types of uses in certain PMDs, they are special uses.

If we want to go back and evaluate and look at those as a whole, let's do that and take a look at it. But we have to do this holistically. We can't rush in and make a decision that'll have a lasting impact on our ability to continue to create jobs and continue to create economic opportunities for our residents, residents, not only of my ward, but throughout the city that go to these distribution warehouse facilities.

As I said, it's the fastest growing market. If we want to have a conversation and continue to talk about air quality, I'm all for it. If we want to go forward with emissions and raising the standards in Washington, sign me up.

I'll go. But I don't think that this is solving that problem. I would ask that we pause here, that we hold this ordinance to have a discussion, to have some of the industry come in because the folks that I've talked to, many of the developers and industrial users who will be most impacted by this have extreme concerns about what this is going to do and how this will impact.

I have three projects going on right now. One of which because it's on the river is a planned development. We're able to put into place on that particular development.

What my concerns are in that part of my ward, and that is traffic and truck traffic come into a residential area. We're able to solve that because of the plan development process. That's fantastic.

The other two that were built were built as of right. We work with that developer. One borders, another ward and I worked with the residents of my adjacent ward and I worked with my colleague, Alderman Cardenas to make sure that the concerns of the residents were listened to and adjustments were made to the development, even with an as of right, those concerns, the developers are concerned about the community.

They're concerned about the quality of life for the people that are working there. Many of our industrial users in my ward also live within the ward. And so there's concern.

So I don't think, I think we all are intending to make the city safer and better for all of our residents. I think we can work together. I don't think this is the right way to do it.

And I'm asking my colleagues to please let's take a minute. What I was told is that the planning department is evaluating all of our PMVs evaluating all of our zoning. And I think we ought to wait until we have that back.

And maybe on some of these PMVs that have lived their life and are adjusting and we need to go back zoning is a privilege, not a right. And so we have to evaluate and perhaps we change the underlying zoning in some of these areas that then achieve. So we can achieve what we're trying to accomplish here and not put a blanket overlay that will burden development.

It'll thwart the ability for our building owners in the, those that are creating job opportunities for our residents to move forward. It's going to take months and the expense it's not everyone is a big developer here. There's a lot of small mom and pops in my ward that will be affected that are in the PMV that will that our warehouse distribution and wholesalers will be affected.

And all I'm asking chairman is that we pause here and we say, let's take a look at the zoning, do a comprehensive evaluation. Just like when we created the PMVs, let's do the same here and have all of the information and all of it distributed to the council and we can make a more educated informed decision. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:27:18 - 3:27:31)
I've got before, well, first of all, you're not a member of the committee, so I can't get a motion from you on this one. But I do have Alderman Beal followed by Alderman Riley. Those are committee members that still would like to speak on this.

[Speaker 2] (3:27:32 - 3:27:51)
Point of information chairman. Alderman Ray Lopez. Yes, sir.

For my own personal point of information question. What, what's the difference between a non-member getting to talk for 10 minutes without a question and me being told that I had to hurry up with a question and then being cut off.

[Speaker 1] (3:27:51 - 3:27:58)
I apologize for that. I was trying to get Alderman Thompson to wrap up his thoughts too, but you're welcome.

[Speaker 2] (3:27:58 - 3:28:12)
I have no problem with Alderman Thompson having his thoughts. I have no problem with any member having their thoughts. It's a little frustrating and downright insulting to be told, to hurry up.

Like I'm a rambling child when I have as equal a say as in this room.

[Speaker 1] (3:28:12 - 3:28:25)
I'm sorry you feel that way. I will get back to you. As soon as we hear from Alderman Tony Beal and then Brendan Riley, and then we'll go back to Alderman Ray Lopez, Alderman Beal.

[Speaker 19] (3:28:25 - 3:32:04)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, as a member of this committee, you know, I'm, I'm deeply troubled by this ordinance. When you look at the problems that we're having already with these departments you know, disregarding input and direction from the Alderman here, here we are once again, giving more authority to people who don't live in the community, people who don't value the input and the knowledge of the elected officials in these wards.

When I looked at that map, a large portion of my ward is involved in this, this ordinance. And I can tell you that right now I'm having a hell of a time getting the department to sign off on a Culver's that is bringing 60 jobs to my community because the department wants something different than what I want, what the community wants, what the developer wants, and what the store owner wants. And because the department sees something a little different and they want us to change, totally going against the entire community.

That's totally going against everything that we have tried to implement in this city as far as what the Alderman are trying to do in our community. And I think that, you know, I've supported a lot of my colleagues and the projects that they have. And a lot of you all have supported me with projects that I have and to have a department hold up 60 jobs in my community because he doesn't like the way the building is sitting.

But again, and I'm going to reiterate, the community wants to build in a certain way. I want the building a certain way, the developer and the entrepreneur, the business owner and the corporate wants to build in a certain way. And because the commissioner doesn't agree, he's holding it up.

And here we are going to give more authority to the departments to go totally against the wishes and the desires of us in our community. Colleagues, what are we doing? What are we doing when we have department heads that won't listen to us?

And then here we are giving more authority to those same people who don't listen to us. It doesn't make any sense. And so there was a manufacturing job created.

I was trying to come into my area. And when they saw these things that were coming down the pipe, they said, you know what, Alderman, thanks, but no thanks. We're the only ones that have land out here on the South side and on the outskirts of the city.

We have an abundance of land. We want jobs, but we want clean jobs and we want them to do the right thing by our communities. So it's our job to make sure that they're doing these things in partnership with the, with the departments.

But when the departments don't listen to us and want to disregard us, that is a huge, huge problem that we have going down the road. And when I look at that map again, a lot of that will take away the authority for me to have the desired input that my community has elected me to have. I have problems and reservations with that.

So I agree with Alderman Thompson that we shouldn't move forward with this ordinance. We need to pause. We need to pull back.

And as a member of this committee, Mr. Chairman, I'll make a motion that we hold this ordinance until we're comfortable and have more dialogue with moving this thing forward. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (3:32:06 - 3:32:16)
And I, I will hear from Alderman Riley and then renew your, we'll renew your motion after this. Alderman Brandon Riley.

[Speaker 36] (3:32:17 - 3:34:42)
Thank you, Chairman Tunney. I actually, it turns out Alderman Thompson communicated a lot of the concerns that I have about the ordinance. And I do think that it's well intended, but I'm concerned.

It is also transferring a tremendous amount of local control and local stakeholder input and feedback to bureaucrats who aren't accountable to our communities directly, like, like Alderman are. And I think like others here today have had some really disappointing experiences with the zoning board of appeals on decisions that they've rendered that impact communities in pretty substantial ways, despite overwhelming opposition from the impacted community, local aldermen, police commander, et cetera. And so, while I do understand and appreciate the goals we're trying to achieve with the ordinance and appreciate the administration for bringing this forward.

I would have to say that I believe Alderman Beal is correct that, that we should spend some more time with this ordinance to make sure we get it right. And it isn't overly broad and doesn't hand over even more control to appoint to bureaucrats when that particular body has been issuing rulings over strenuous objections from impacted communities. So I do think that we can get an ordinance in shape that is properly limited in scope that achieves these goals without, I think, you know, resulting this pretty substantial transfer of power.

And I also think I don't see at least any immediate urgency in passing this ordinance today. I don't know that spending some more time working on it wouldn't result in a better product a month from now, but I do support my colleague's motion to hold this. We can work on it and get this right.

Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (3:34:42 - 3:34:58)
Thank you. Thank you, Alderman. Alderman Ray Lopez.

Before we entertain the motion to hold, I wanted to give you some additional time so you can ask a question or give me more criticism because I'm okay with it.

[Speaker 2] (3:35:01 - 3:35:18)
I don't like the background of your Zoom. No Chairman, I will not ask any more questions. I think everything has been said.

I actually would respectfully call the question and ask to join Alderman Beal in his motion. All right. Ask for a roll call vote to that effect.

[Speaker 1] (3:35:19 - 3:35:39)
Okay. So Alderman Beal, Riley and Lopez make a motion to defer this item and is asking for a roll call. Okay.

So I will call the roll.

[Speaker 19] (3:35:42 - 3:35:49)
Mr. Chairman, if you're looking at holding this, you don't need a roll call. If you just holding it for the, you know, the authority of the chair.

[Speaker 1] (3:35:49 - 3:35:59)
What is the wish of the body? Alderman Lopez, Alderman Riley. Do we want a roll call?

[Speaker 2] (3:35:59 - 3:36:11)
If you're going to hold it as chairman, then I, then I would agree. And I'm happy to say that we can pull it back and let you hold it from this meeting to be called at a later date.

[Speaker 1] (3:36:11 - 3:36:21)
Okay. Okay. So Chairman Alderman Riley here.

Okay. Alderman Riley.

[Speaker 36] (3:36:22 - 3:36:37)
Point of information. Chairman, I just, you know, perhaps if, if you as the chair choose to hold this in committee for some additional work and conversation, Alderman Beal could then withdraw his motion and we could avoid having a roll call.

[Speaker 47] (3:36:38 - 3:36:38)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (3:36:39 - 3:37:04)
So in opinion of the chair, I think it might behoove us all to spend a little more time on the ordinance and ask to hold this in committee and to spend some more time on both sides of the aisle. Obviously we've heard from a number of aldermen that this needs more work. So I'm going to hold it in committee.

[Speaker 19] (3:37:05 - 3:37:09)
Mr. Chairman, I do withdraw my motion so you can hold it. All right.

[Speaker 1] (3:37:10 - 3:37:30)
I see, uh, I see, uh, Alderman Lopez, Raymond Lopez is cool with that too. So, uh, all right. So we're not going to do a roll call.

We're going to hold it in committee. And, um, I appreciate everyone's patience on this, uh, on both the city departments and also our colleagues. Mr. Chairman, if I can just add one more.

[Speaker 19] (3:37:31 - 3:37:55)
The item has been deferred for the chair. Mr. Chairman, if I can just add one thing for the crafters of this ordinance, because I do know that some of my colleagues are in favor of this particular ordinance. If they want to add a, um, opt in or opt out clause, if they want this ordinance in their ward, then, you know, so be it.

Um, and, but every alderman should have the right to opt in or out if they want to add that language.

[Speaker 1] (3:37:59 - 3:38:11)
Well said or not, but many of these PMDs cover multiple wards. So it's, it might be a little tricky on some of that, but, uh, point taken. All right.

So now we are going to go to large signs.

[Speaker 2] (3:38:16 - 3:38:21)
Are we going into recess still, or are we still, no, we're going to do the science first.

[Speaker 1] (3:38:21 - 3:38:32)
It should take about, about two minutes and then we'll recess for if it's the will of the, of the committee for about 10 minutes and then get into the private applications.

[Speaker 59] (3:38:32 - 3:38:33)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:38:33 - 3:39:45)
Right. Uh, so. Moving on.

We have large signs over a hundred square feet in area, 24 feet above grade. We'll hear them all together. I'll read the ward followed by the address and take a motion at the end in the first ward, 2048 North Milwaukee Avenue for signs in the 18th ward at 7353 South Cicero Avenue in the 23rd ward, 7,000 West 63rd street in the 31st ward, 4100 West diversity Avenue in the 39th ward, 4025 West Peterson Avenue, two signs in the 42nd ward at 303 East Wacker.

Also in the 42nd ward, 401 North Michigan Avenue. Again in 42 second ward, I should say 35 North state, three signs in the 47th ward at 49 12 North Clark street. And lastly, three signs in the 47th ward at 3300 North Campbell.

If there are no questions by committee members, do I hear a motion do pass for these items by the same roll call? It was used to determine quorum.

[Speaker 32] (3:39:46 - 3:39:47)
Well, she do pass Cardona.

[Speaker 1] (3:39:49 - 3:40:17)
Cardona was to do pass any objections hearing none. The items are passed. Uh, we have one small housekeeping matter in regards to signs.

There is a two direct introductions from Alderman Garza for signs. The items are not up for discussion today, but are simply being introduced. And I need a motion to accept that direct introduction.

[Speaker 18] (3:40:17 - 3:40:18)
Motion move Cardona.

[Speaker 1] (3:40:19 - 4:00:29)
Alderman Cardona moves to accept the direct introduction by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the ordinance is accepted into committee.

We'll now take a small recess and reconvene at let's just say one 45. Um, thank you very much. We'll see you in a few.

All right. Okay. We're reconvening, uh, the committee on zoning and we'll move on to the regular agenda.

Uh, uh, you know, in an effort to minimize technical difficulties and to ensure the committee meeting runs as smoothly as possible, the typical order in which items will be heard has been updated throughout the duration of virtual committee on zoning meetings. I just will be grouped together according to witnesses or attorneys and will be heard in that order rather than in the ward order. So it's the same procedure we've been doing.

So, all right, we're on page three. I believe we're starting this one. Yep.

Okay. Uh, document number a 8,600 fourth ward ordinance was referred on July 22nd of 2020 common address, 39 61 to 39 67 South Drexel Boulevard, 39 79 through 39 83 South Drexel Boulevard, 39 46 through 39 78 South Drexel Boulevard, 4,000 to 4,008 South Drexel Boulevard, eight 17 East 40th street, 800 through 804 East 40th street and 39 51 through 39 85 South cottage Grove Avenue. The change request C one three neighborhood commercial district and a B three community shopping district to an RM five residential multi-unit district.

And I believe we have Alderman Sophia King or apprentice or staff apprentice maybe apprentices here. I believe from yes.

[Speaker 39] (4:00:29 - 4:00:49)
Chairman Tony, I'm here. We filed this ordinance to bring up to date the zoning in an area. The previous zoning speaks to commercial paths of that part of our community.

And we wish to change it to the current use, which is residential. And we hope that facilitates the development of the vacant parcels still in that area.

[Speaker 1] (4:00:52 - 4:01:21)
Questions for Alderman's Alderman staff. Any, can I get a motion to move chairman? Alderman Lopez moves to accept motion.

All of in Lopez moves to pass on this item. All those in favor. Aye.

[Speaker 23] (4:01:22 - 4:01:22)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (4:01:22 - 4:02:12)
Aye. Any opposed hearing on the opinion chair, the eyes have it. And the item has passed.

Thank you very much. Thank you. Next we're going to item number eight, eight six Oh one 18th ward ordinance was referred on July 22nd of 2020 common address.

3206 to 3348 west 87th street and 8,600 through 86, 18 South Kedzie Avenue change request business plan development number 1172 to business plan development number 1172 as amended. We have Alderman I believe Derek Curtis on this item. Yes.

[Speaker 53] (4:02:13 - 4:03:03)
Yes. Thank you. Chairman.

This is Alderman Derek Curtis. I definitely support this. This this build out actually be about maybe a $3 million building structure that we're going to, to, to have we did a study in our ward.

You know, we're losing over $3 million not having our own carwash by me being at the edge of the city. You know, everyone's taking their business to evergreen park or Burbank. I'm really excited about what we're doing with that corner.

So I definitely support this and I'm asking my colleagues to support it also. Thank you chairman. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (4:03:03 - 4:03:18)
Alderman Alderman you're aware for the committee members benefit. Also there were a number of objectors to this application about the carwash. Have you met with them?

[Speaker 53] (4:03:19 - 4:03:44)
I did. I met, I met at the site in June. I met at the site in June.

I had a huge meeting and I had, I had a lot of support. So I'm thinking those people are now on board. I'm sure they are.

I have not gotten any, any calls back since then. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (4:03:45 - 4:04:05)
Questions from committee members. Hearing no questions. Do I have a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Cardona do pass. Alderman Cardona moves do pass. Any objections?

Hearing none. The item is passed.

[Speaker 9] (4:04:06 - 4:04:08)
We're going to skip the next one until all the way back.

[Speaker 1] (4:04:08 - 4:04:38)
Okay. We're going to go to page four. Page four in the first ward number 20495 ordinance was referred on nine nine of 2020.

Common address is 1349 West and Kona street. Change request. RS three residential single unit detached house district to an RM 4.5 residential multi-unit district. We have Tyler Manick as the attorney on this application.

[Speaker 13] (4:04:39 - 4:05:24)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee for the record. My name is Tyler Manick of Shane banks, Kenny and Schwartz. I'm here on behalf of the applicant H homes and development and seeking a zoning map amendment from an RS three zoning district to an RM 4.5 zoning district to allow for the construction of a two and a half story single family residence with a two car attached garage. This since filing this application, the applicant just has converted this application to a type one zoning map amendment. So I would seek this committee's motion to convert this application to a type one zoning map amendment, incorporate the plans narrative that we submitted.

[Speaker 1] (4:05:25 - 4:05:39)
All right. So Alderman Ray Lopez moves to amend the application to a type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections hearing none?

[Speaker 13] (4:05:39 - 4:06:30)
The item is amended to the type one application. Now we can proceed. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This zoning map amendment is necessary due to the lot area being only 1,440 square feet, which is less than 50% of the typical Chicago lot size prior to filing this application. The applicant did significant community outreach by meeting with the neighbors on the block. And Eckhart community council who support this application.

The applicant has further worked with Alderman LaSpada staff and Alderman LaSpada, who was kind enough to issue my client a letter of support, which is on file with this committee, with this committee, with the support of the Alderman and the community, the applicant respectfully requests this committee's favorable recommendation to pass a zoning map amendment to an RM 4.5 zoning district on 1349 West and Connor. And I'd be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (4:06:30 - 4:07:23)
Questions from committee members. Do I hear a motion to pass the, uh, by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. The move chairman Alderman Lopez Lopez moves do pass any objections hearing on the item is passed as amended to the type one.

Now we're staying with Tyler manic on item number 204, nine zero T one 47th ward. Ordinance was referred on September 9th of 2020. Common address is 2208 West Lawrence Avenue.

Change request B two, three neighborhood mixed use district to a B two, three neighborhood mixed use district. So it looks like we're changing the type one. Is that correct?

[Speaker 13] (4:07:23 - 4:08:35)
Correct. Mr. Chairman. Okay.

Let's talk about it. Thank you again, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. And once again, for the record, my name is Tyler manic ashamed banks, Kenny and Schwartz.

The applicant has worked closely with Alderman Martin, his zoning advisory council, the local community group in the chamber of commerce on this project.

Each have given their support to this project and include including the Alderman who submitted to the committee, his letter of support with the support of the Alderman Alderman Martin, and the community. I also request this committee's favorable recommendation to approve this zoning map amendments so that the new type one plans can be amended into this parcel. And I would be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (4:08:38 - 4:08:49)
Before we take questions, I need to accept the substantive narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum on this one, right? Tyler.

[Speaker 13] (4:08:49 - 4:08:52)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I did forget that.

[Speaker 1] (4:08:53 - 4:09:22)
Okay. So I get a motion by Alderman Kappelman moves to accept the substantive narrative plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that hearing on the substantive narrative and plans are accepted.

Now I need a motion to pass. I need a motion to pass this substantive narrative and plans application. Can I get a motion on that?

[Speaker 33] (4:09:24 - 4:09:24)
No moved.

[Speaker 1] (4:09:25 - 4:10:17)
Alderman Hadden moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections hearing on the item is passed again with the substantive narrative and plans. All right.

Now we're at a tie with Tyler again, a item number two Oh four one five T one in the 46th ward ordinance was referred on May 20th of 2020. Common address is 35 Oh one through 35 19 North Halsted Avenue. And the change request is a C one two neighborhood commercial district to a C one five neighborhood commercial district.

Tyler would you present this project please?

[Speaker 13] (4:10:18 - 4:10:38)
Yes, Mr. Chairman and members committee. Once again, for the record, my name is Tyler Mannequin, Shane banks, Kenny and Schwartz. This application also has a revised narrative and type one plans.

So I would like to get a motion to amend the type one application if possible, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 2] (4:10:39 - 4:10:43)
Correct. Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 1] (4:10:43 - 4:11:12)
Alderman Lopez moves to accept the substantive narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was to determine quorum. Any objections to that? Hearing none, the substantive narrative and plans are accepted.

Now we need, if I'm not mistaken, we need to accept substitute ordinance. We need to accept a substitute ordinance. Is that also in the works?

[Speaker 13] (4:11:12 - 4:11:18)
I don't believe so, Mr. Chairman. It's the same ordinance.

[Speaker 1] (4:11:19 - 4:11:25)
Okay. Let's hear from the department on that. Is Anna or Steve or whoever?

[Speaker 35] (4:11:27 - 4:11:28)
A chairman.

[Speaker 1] (4:11:33 - 4:11:59)
You're, you're, you're echoing loudly. It sounds interesting, but we can't, we can't really hear you correctly. Anna, Anna, Anna Robles.

How about Patrick Murphy? Somebody.

[Speaker 3] (4:11:59 - 4:12:05)
Chairman, this is Patrick. I'll go down. And it's down the hall for me in another conference room.

I'll go down and talk to him. We'll circle back on this.

[Speaker 51] (4:12:05 - 4:12:14)
Chairman. I'm sorry. Can you hear me now?

We can loud and clear, Anna. Okay, great. They did submit a substitute ordinance, but I didn't see any change.

[Speaker 1] (4:12:18 - 4:12:30)
Okay. So we're good to go on, on accepting the, the, they submitted. We don't need an additional vote on.

This is what we're saying.

[Speaker 51] (4:12:32 - 4:12:49)
No, I'm not clear why they submitted a substitute ordinance. I see no change, but the title is. Okay.

All right. Let's, let's keep going then Tyler.

[Speaker 13] (4:12:50 - 4:15:22)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm here on behalf of the applicant, Howard Brown health center, who seeks a zoning map amendment to relocate their medical clinic, 3501 North Halstead. I'm pleased to represent Howard Brown in this, this zoning map amendment, which has been an active and essential member of the North Halstead neighborhood since 1974.

Since 1974, Howard Brown has provided, has been essential to fulfilling the North Halstead communities needs, as well as caring for many of the city's most vulnerable citizens. Mr. David Munier, the Howard Brown's chief executive officer had. To leave because of another engagement, but I'm also joined by Frankie Reynolds, Howard Brown's associate director of project management.

And also with me as a project architect, Michelle Hunter, principal of architrave who prepared the plans. All of us would be willing to answer questions after this present. Howard Brown proposes a zoning map amendment from a C one, two to C one, five community shopping district for 3501 North Halstead.

The property is a transit server location and, and is adjacent to a pedestrian street. The project will be a five-story medical clinic on the brown floor. There will be retail space, which will include a pharmacy that is necessary to provide specialized services to fit the needs of Howard Brown's patients.

The second and third floors will include medical clinic offices. The fourth floor includes Howard Brown's dentistry clinic. The fifth floor will include Howard Brown's behavioral health and social sciences, as well as its administrative offices.

The total height of the building will be 67 feet prior to the committee meeting. Howard Brown participated in eight community meetings, including meetings with nearby condo associations, the triangle neighbors, community group, and the 46th ward zoning and development committee. As a result of the input received at those meetings, Howard Brown made substantial revisions to its original plans, which included setting back the fifth floor from the Halstead and Cornelia street frontages and eliminating a proposed six story.

With these revisions, Howard Brown was able to earn the support of the triangle neighbors, community group in the 46th ward zoning and development committee. We've also received a letter of support from Alderman Kappelman who we thank for his dedicated efforts and assistance, which was necessary to find the appropriate compromises that ultimately earned the support of the local community group and its advisory committee. We'd be happy to answer any questions, but we respectfully request this committee's favorable recommendation to rezone 3501 North Halstead to a C one five community shopping district.

[Speaker 1] (4:15:23 - 4:15:29)
All right. Thank you. I would like to hear from Alderman Kappelman.

[Speaker 54] (4:15:30 - 4:16:35)
Thank you. Thank you, chairman Tunney. And also I want to thank you for your input.

It's it's right across the street from your ward, the 44th ward. So your, your involvement was also extraordinarily helpful. Tyler Manick said it all about all the input from the different residents around that, including the neighborhood organization.

And I, I believe that their input helped to make it better. So when it did go before the 46 ward zoning development committee, there was a vote of 14 people in favor and one person opposed to it because they, that person did not like the design. So I, I commend the hard work of the 46 ward zoning development committee and I will support their request to, to have this zoning change.

So I asked my colleagues to also support this as well. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (4:16:36 - 4:17:27)
Thank you Alderman. I know you and I spent a lot of time on this, on this project and I'll hold my comment until I don't hear any, I don't see any of their hands up. So as the Alderman that surrounds this, three corners of this there was a, there was an objector in the 800 building that spoke in the public comment period.

I believe that they, while they might disagree with it, I would disagree with the fact that their voices were not heard. And I believe that we made adjustments based on some of my residents, or your residents on the other side of Cornelia. But the narrative says it's a six story medical office building.

I believe Alderman, it's not a six story anymore.

[Speaker 54] (4:17:27 - 4:17:29)
It's five stories. Five story.

[Speaker 1] (4:17:29 - 4:17:33)
Yeah. Okay. Cause the narrative still says six.

I know we have a substitute.

[Speaker 13] (4:17:34 - 4:17:37)
We revised that Mr. Chairman, the five stories.

[Speaker 1] (4:17:37 - 4:19:08)
Okay. I just want to make sure the public knows that we did take a floor off after listening to the committee and the other, the other kind of a short statement about that was, you know, that North of Addison, which is the block away, there's plenty of density at the five level, whether it be the center on Halstead, our LGBT senior housing and such. So, you know, it's, there is some compatible nature around there.

And most of the buildings that as we move forward, our four story buildings on Halstead street, this is one story higher. So for the record, I did, I didn't want to say that for the record and to thank you for your leadership on this issue. And and Howard Brown obviously is, you know, is one of the largest service providers in the city for our community.

So I think in some respects, we have to give some credence to their good not-for-profit stature and their work in the community. So with that being said, can I get a motion to move a pass on this item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderman Beal moves to pass on the motion by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections to that? Hearing none, the item is passed with revised as substantive narrative and plans. Tyler, I think we are done with me, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 13] (4:19:09 - 4:19:10)
That's it.

[Speaker 1] (4:19:10 - 4:20:05)
Okay. Now I'm going to move back to page three because Alderman Wagesback is here on document number A8602, 32nd Ward. Ordinance was referred on July 22nd of 2020.

This is to classify a segment of North Lincoln Avenue right away from the center line of West Diversity Avenue on the South and the center line of West Belmont on the North as a pedestrian retail street. Alderman Wagesback? Not in?

I thought he was in. No. Okay.

All right. Then we're going to hold on this one too, because he's not, he's not here.

[Speaker 7] (4:20:05 - 4:20:07)
Who are you looking for?

[Speaker 1] (4:20:08 - 4:20:09)
Alderman Wagesback.

[Speaker 59] (4:20:10 - 4:20:10)
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 1] (4:20:11 - 4:20:13)
All right. We'll hold that one.

[Speaker 23] (4:20:14 - 4:20:14)
Top of page five.

[Speaker 21] (4:20:15 - 4:20:18)
Yes, Chairman, if you could hold it for me, please.

[Speaker 1] (4:20:19 - 4:20:57)
We'll hold it. Okay. So near the end.

Okay. All right. Now we're on the top of page five in the first ward.

Document number 205-05-T1. The first ward ordinance was referred on September 9th of 2020. Common address is 1512 West Ohio Street.

Change request. RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RM 4.5 residential residential multi-unit district. And we have Sarah Barnes, I believe on that.

[Speaker 10] (4:21:00 - 4:21:53)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Sarah Barnes and I'm an attorney with the law offices of Samuel VP Banks located at 221 Northwest downstreet. I'm happy to be here this afternoon on behalf of the applicant 1512 Ohio LLC.

Before I begin, Mr. Chairman, I would like to note for the record that this application was submitted as a mandatory type one application. And prior to this hearing, we did deliver a copy of a substitute set of architectural plans, as well as a substitute narrative. To the department of planning and development for which we would respectfully request that those items be supplemented into the record here today.

And any votes that do occur occur with regard to those substitute materials.

[Speaker 1] (4:21:54 - 4:22:12)
So Alderman Roboius moves to accept the substantive narrative plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine. So move. So move, Mr. Chair. Any objections to that first? So hearing none, the substantive narrative plans are accepted. Continue Sarah.

[Speaker 10] (4:22:12 - 4:23:36)
Thank you so much. For the record, the site is presently improved with an old vacant two and a half story multi-unit residential building, as well as a detached coach house. These improvements are nonconforming under the current zoning ordinance and have fallen into a state of deplorable disrepair over time due to the neglect of a previous property owner.

The applicant therefore is seeking to raise the existing and vacant structures and to redevelop the site with a new four story three unit residential building. Parking for each of the units will be provided in a detached garage at the rear of the lot. Over the course of the last year, we have worked very closely with Alderman LaSpada's office, as well as the Eckert community, Eckert Park community council, towards the proposal that you have before you here today.

Over those many months, we also had a community meeting and made several revisions to the proposal that are again reflected in the substitute plan. With this, we have garnered the express support of both the Eckert Park community council and Alderman LaSpada, which I believe a copy of the letter of support has been tendered to the committee prior to this hearing by Alderman LaSpada.

[Speaker 1] (4:23:37 - 4:23:40)
We have received a letter of support from Alderman LaSpada.

[Speaker 10] (4:23:41 - 4:23:51)
With that, if there are no questions, I just very respectfully request the support of this body for the proposal before you here today.

[Speaker 1] (4:23:51 - 4:24:43)
Any questions by committee members? Do I hear a motion to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Don't move, Mr. Chairman. Alderman Ray Lopez moves do pass. Objections? Hearing none.

The item is passed with substantive narrative and plans. All right, now we're on the middle of page five. Again, in the second ward, item number 20502 T1.

Again, second ward ordinance was referred on September 9th of 2020. Common address is 1436 West Blackhawk street. The change request RS3 residential single unit detached house district to a B2-3 neighborhood mixed use district.

Sarah? Thank you.

[Speaker 10] (4:24:43 - 4:27:08)
Once again, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee for the record, my name is Sarah Barnes and I'm an attorney with the Lofts of Sam Banks. I'm happy to be here this afternoon on behalf of the applicant, 1436 West Blackhawk LLC. The subject property is presently improved with a four story mixed use building, which contains a single vacant commercial unit at grade level and eight residential dwelling units above.

The applicant recently acquired the property and the improvements with the intention to rehabilitate and upgrade the existing eight dwelling units, as well as to reactivate the grade level commercial space. Unfortunately, however, the grade level commercial unit has been vacant for over a year and therefore the improvements have become nonconforming under the current zoning ordinance. As a result, the applicant is seeking the subject zoning map amendment in order to permit the reestablishment and licensing of a cafe restaurant within the existing grade level commercial space, which such cafe will be locally owned and operated.

Aside from the build out of the existing commercial space to allow for the proposed new cafe, as well as some minor interior renovations and upgrades to the existing eight dwelling units, there is no physical expansion being proposed to either the footprint or the envelope of the building. Again, this space, or just to be clear, the proposed zoning map amendment is required purely with regard to reactivating that commercial use, which has become nonconforming. The applicant and the rest of our development team has worked with Alderman Hopkins office, as well as met with and presented the proposals to several of the local residents and community members in the neighborhood.

The proposal was met with unanimous support. They're very excited to get a restaurant and cafe that can serve the neighborhood. So with that, Alderman Hopkins has also extended his support that was memorialized in a letter, which again, I believe was tendered to the committee prior to this hearing.

[Speaker 1] (4:27:09 - 4:27:12)
We have received a letter of support from Alderman Hopkins.

[Speaker 10] (4:27:12 - 4:27:24)
If there's any questions, I'm very happy to entertain those. Otherwise once more, we do just respectfully request the support of this committee for the proposal before you.

[Speaker 1] (4:27:25 - 4:27:29)
Alderman Hopkins, are you on? And if so, would you like to say a few words?

[Speaker 30] (4:27:30 - 4:28:57)
Yes, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. I'll be brief since council more than adequately summed up the situation and there is unanimous support in the community for this.

I just simply want to point out what makes this property a little special. It is in fact, a mid-block commercial storefront space in a residential neighborhood. We all know earlier we approved, you know, landmarking for a corner commercial space, which is typically what you see in residential areas, but this was a mid-block space and long time residents of the neighborhood recall its various uses over the years.

It's been a deli, a market, a corner convenience store, but it's been abandoned. And boarded up in vacant and dark for many, many years. So the neighborhood is just delighted that it will be activated and in use once again.

And it's brought back a lot of fond memories for some of the long time residents of, of this tight knit community. And it, it hearkens back to a time when every neighborhood used to have these small commercial spaces, not just on the corners, but scattered throughout. So I am just delighted to submit this for approval.

And we're very supportive of the business plan for this neighborhood coffee shop and cafe. We think it's going to be an anchor for this area and it's going to be a place where people like to congregate and new neighbors can meet the old neighbors. So this is just a very special thing and we're pleased to move forward.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (4:29:00 - 4:29:19)
All right. Questions for the Alderman or the applicant. One quick question for either since it's mid-block, you wanted to keep it resident, the B2 instead of a B3, just in case the restaurant.

[Speaker 30] (4:29:20 - 4:29:35)
Yeah, I'll, well, I'll let council respond, but I believe the intention is to affect the zoning change to get the property up and running and activated. And then it will be returned at some point to an R designation. Please correct me if I'm wrong, Ms. Barnes.

[Speaker 10] (4:29:36 - 4:30:02)
Yeah, that's correct. Alderman and Mr. Chairman, the intent would be to effectuate this as a temporary zoning change to allow for the cafe to get up and operated and then to rezone it back down into a residential, an appropriate residential classification. We chose the B2 in the interim because it was the closest to mimic a residential zoning classification.

[Speaker 1] (4:30:03 - 4:30:24)
And the building appropriately was big enough as is with the three in regards to the density and or height. Okay. And we do have a user, right?

So we do know we're going to have an active user and somebody that the community has already excited about sounding from all of them.

[Speaker 10] (4:30:24 - 4:30:57)
Yeah, exactly. And kind of paralleling off of Alderman Hopkins, this particular cafe is like I said, locally owned and operated by two women who first started their, they have another cafe in the Bucktown neighborhood over off of Damon Avenue in a very similar building, mid black, predominantly residential and they've just been thriving and they're just a great resource for residents in the neighborhood to grab a coffee and sit down with their kids.

So I think it's a really nice fit.

[Speaker 1] (4:30:57 - 4:31:09)
All right. So any more questions, committee members? Hearing none.

Get a motion. Alderman Hopkins.

[Speaker 30] (4:31:11 - 4:31:12)
Move approval.

[Speaker 1] (4:31:12 - 4:31:41)
Yep. Makes the motion to do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to Alderman Hopkins motion?

Hearing none item is passed. Congrats both to the Alderman and hopefully a very successful business. Hey, we have the next item in 32 Sarah, but I don't think Alderman Wagesback is ready to hear it.

He's got something else we deferred until later in the meeting.

Yeah, well, I was talking to myself, so Raymond Lopez, you've done it to me again.

[Speaker 26] (4:42:24 - 4:42:24)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (4:42:25 - 4:42:31)
All right. Um, I think chairman Wagus back is back is what I, what I've been told.

[Speaker 21] (4:42:32 - 4:42:38)
Yes, sir. I am. Okay.

So what page do we hear? Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (4:42:38 - 4:43:10)
They're five or age five, age five. First, we got the other manic, I think. So let's start.

We're going back to page three. Document number eight, eight, six. So two 32nd ward ordinance was referred on July 22nd of 2020.

And this is to classify a segment of the North Lincoln Avenue right away from the center line of West diversity Avenue on the South to the center line of West Belmont on the North as a pedestrian retail street. Scott, you want to talk about this?

[Speaker 21] (4:43:11 - 4:44:29)
Sure. Thank you, chairman. And this is adjacent to your ward.

This is an order ordinance designating a segment of Lincoln between diversity and Belmont as a pedestrian oriented retail street. We worked with the South Lake view neighbors and the Lake view chamber of commerce on this initiative. This would fill in a gap of Lincoln Avenue and promote future development.

That's geared toward a more vibrant walkable retail environment. The regulations that are part of this are intended to preserve and enhance the character of those pedestrian streets, provide more safety, economic vitality and create more friendly shopping districts here. So specifically development would have building facades at or near the sidewalk, large storefront windows and pedestrian entrances off the sidewalk as opposed to side lots or gangways and not adjacent to parking areas.

And it would also prohibit use of drive through facilities, gas stations and car washes on that section of the Lincoln Avenue. So this is just working on different urban planning policies with our local agencies and community groups. And I would ask for the support of fellow committee members on this item.

Thank you, chairman.

[Speaker 1] (4:44:30 - 4:44:39)
Thank you. Questions for Alderman Wagesbeck. I have Alderman Ray Lopez with his hand up.

[Speaker 2] (4:44:39 - 4:44:55)
Ray. Thank you, chairman. Good afternoon, chairman Wagesbeck.

I just have a question about this ordinance. Does this actually help reduce traffic as well, or is this solely for the sidewalk and pedestrian parts of the street?

[Speaker 21] (4:44:57 - 4:45:41)
Well, it's it's done comprehensively with a program for some of the traffic safety issues that we've been doing with the SSA and the chamber there. So bump outs, bike stalls or corrals. So that's sort of tied into it.

And it looking at the types of businesses for the zoning aspect of it. When you have, you know, car washes coming into the middle of, you know, some of those pedestrian oriented buildings. Yeah, it's more around the safety issue of it.

So I think it's, it's really just promoting that retail and walkability. Thank you, chairman and chairman.

[Speaker 1] (4:45:42 - 4:45:46)
And Scott, it really doesn't allow new driveways, right? Whether it's a car wash.

[Speaker 21] (4:45:46 - 4:46:06)
Yeah. We're trying to prohibit, which is what was going on in Lincoln for a lot of these condo buildings where the driveway would come out right between a bookstore and a, you know, say a childcare place. So really just trying to look at the different types of planning issues there.

All right.

[Speaker 1] (4:46:07 - 4:46:09)
I see Alderman Osterman's hand up.

[Speaker 48] (4:46:11 - 4:46:19)
Thank you, chairman. Alderman Wagsback. What we're on Lincoln Avenue or are we doing this?

I missed that part of your presentation.

[Speaker 21] (4:46:19 - 4:46:22)
This would be between diversity and Belmont.

[Speaker 48] (4:46:23 - 4:46:46)
Okay. Just for my colleagues who've never been over there. I think Alderman Wagsback and the chambers have done a really good job on these soft amenities with the curbs that have really helped in recent years.

So I think continuing to enhance this is it's a nice thing and folks should get a chance to take a look at it. So thank you.

[Speaker 1] (4:46:48 - 4:46:52)
Thank you all. Can I get a motion?

[Speaker 16] (4:46:53 - 4:46:54)
Motion to move Cardona.

[Speaker 1] (4:46:56 - 4:47:12)
Alderman Cardona makes the motion to move to pass on this item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to the motion? Hearing none.

The item is passed. All right, Scott, we got one more, I think. Now we're on.

[Speaker 21] (4:47:13 - 4:47:15)
This would be Sarah's I think.

[Speaker 1] (4:47:16 - 4:47:45)
Yes, we're on. Okay. Okay.

Item number 20506 T1, 32nd Court. Ordinance was referred on September 9th of 2020. Common address, 1601 Northwestern Avenue.

And the change request, B3-2 Community Shopping District to B3-2 Community Shopping District. So this is a T1 and we're probably going to have some changes to the T1. Sarah.

[Speaker 10] (4:47:47 - 4:49:12)
Afternoon once again, Mr. Chairman and for the last time today, members of the committee, my name is Sarah Barnes and I'm an attorney with the lobsters of Sam Banks. I'm happy to be here this afternoon on behalf of the applicant GW North and Western LLC. As previously alluded to by the chairman, this is actually an amendment to a previously ratified type one zoning change ordinance.

The original zoning change called for an all commercial use at the property. But unfortunately, but gratefully due to certain changes in the marketplace, that proposal has no longer become feasible. However, the applicant is the same as the previous owner and developer, and he found a substitute proposal that actually works for the site and that we believe will be far more beneficial for the community.

Before I get to that, however, I should begin, should have begun with the fact that prior to the hearing, we did tender a copy of certain substitute plans as well as a substitute narrative to the department of planning and development. We would ask that those substitute materials, please be adopted into the record here today and that any vote that is to take place be rendered with regard to those materials.

[Speaker 1] (4:49:12 - 4:49:36)
So I'm going to have Alderman Rob Boyas moves to accept the substantive narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections on the substantive narrative and plans are accepted. So now we have questions, right?

Well, we have the Alderman Scott.

[Speaker 21] (4:49:37 - 4:50:06)
Thank you, chairman. As Sarah pointed out, this is a previously approved and ratified type one. The architect did make some slight changes on it.

It doesn't alter the FAR, the height or the footprint of the building. And we have the support of the neighbors and the local organization there just to make sure that they were aware of this slight change. So I would just ask for the favorable consideration of this item by my colleagues.

Thank you, chairman.

[Speaker 1] (4:50:06 - 4:50:14)
Questions for the applicant or the Alderman? Hearing none, can I get a motion?

[Speaker 2] (4:50:15 - 4:50:16)
Motion moved by Alderman Cardona.

[Speaker 1] (4:50:17 - 4:50:37)
Alderman Cardona moves to accept or to pass the ordinance with the substantive narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the substantive narrative and plans are accepted.

Thank you.

[Speaker 21] (4:50:37 - 4:50:38)
Thank you, chairman.

[Speaker 10] (4:50:38 - 4:50:40)
Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (4:50:40 - 4:51:13)
All right. Now we're going to the bottom of page seven. And this is in the second ward.

Item number 20466 T1. Second ward ordinance was referred on September 9th of 2020. Common address 1725 North Burling Street.

Change request is a B13 neighborhood shopping district to a B13 neighborhood shopping district. Again, probably a change on the type one. And we have Mr. Tom Moore.

[Speaker 24] (4:51:14 - 4:52:58)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name for the record is Tom Moore. This is a case where in 2006, there was a church and a orange rated parsonage and the community wanted to save the orange rated parsonage.

And as a part of the six unit condominium, the parsonage was included in it. And it's always been a B use. It's always been, it was an architect for most of the years.

And, but it, part of the plan was to eliminate the second floor. But when they went to do that, because it's 130 year old building, 1870s or eighties building, the, it would have destabilized it. And they never did remove that floor.

And so there now is available just a block away to make this a T1. So basically nothing external is changing. It just legalizes the second floor, which was kept there.

And now makes the building conforming. We had a community meeting with, with the Alderman and Lincoln central, which has been involved way back when the project was originally created. They're the ones who wanted to save the parsonage.

And as I say, this, nothing will change. It's just a, it just makes the project now conforming. And we have Alderman Hopkins support.

We'd request your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (4:53:01 - 4:53:14)
Well, we do have a letter of support from Alderman Hopkins. Any questions by committee members? Hearing no questions, can I get a motion?

[Speaker 35] (4:53:17 - 4:53:18)
Move approval, sir.

[Speaker 1] (4:53:19 - 4:53:34)
Repeat who made the motion? I'm sorry. Alderman Roboius makes the motion by the same roll call that was used to make the building conform.

Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

[Speaker 39] (4:53:35 - 4:53:36)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (4:53:38 - 4:54:05)
All right. Moving on to the top of page eight. Item number 20469, T1, third ward.

Ordinance was referred on September 9th of 2020. Common address of this application is 3431 South Indiana Avenue. And the change request C12 neighborhood commercial district to an RS3 residential single unit detached house district.

[Speaker 24] (4:54:06 - 4:54:47)
Mr. Moore. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Tom Moore.

And this is a property that the whole rest of the block is residential. There might be one other C property on it, but the applicant wants to build a single family and indeed now has a buyer for it. We did substitute the plans because the buyer did not want to pay for a roof deck.

So the substitute plans are the exact same ones, except they don't have a roof deck. And we have the support of the neighbors and of Alderman Dowell and would request your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (4:54:48 - 4:55:19)
So that first thing. So Alderman Cardona moves to accept the substantive narrative plans for the one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum objections to that motion. Hearing none, the substantive narrative and plans are accepted.

Questions. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Dowell. Can I get a motion?

[Speaker 2] (4:55:20 - 4:55:20)
So move chairman.

[Speaker 1] (4:55:22 - 4:56:04)
That was Alderman Lopez. Alderman Lopez moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none. The item is passed with the substantive narrative and plans. Now we're moving on to the middle of page eight, document number two Oh five one two T one 25th ward.

The ordinance was referred on September 9th of 2020. Common address is 21 52 West 21st street. And the change request is a B three two community shopping district to a B two three neighborhood mixed use district.

Mr. Moore.

[Speaker 24] (4:56:04 - 4:57:06)
Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is a in the 25th ward and we've had extensive repeated discussions with the 25th ward community zoning committee.

This is a building that was literally falling apart is in building court. I had an illegal extra floor on it. The plan is to totally legalize and legitimize the building and increase from six units to nine units in our district.

The building will be totally renovated and made current and become totally code compliant. As a part of our discussions, two of the three new units, it's currently six. It will be nine will be affordable.

And we have a letter of support from Alderman Ciccio Lopez and we've requested your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (4:57:08 - 4:57:25)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Ciccio Lopez is in Ciccio on the call still. Yeah. Yes, chairman.

Oh, great. Okay. Alderman, would you like to comment on this issue in the, in on 21st street?

[Speaker 5] (4:57:25 - 4:57:55)
Yeah, no, no. Just very, very quickly. I know it's been a long meeting.

Just thank you to the applicant. We did have a very robust conversation, even though that this is the, it did not require any affordable housing, really happy that the applicant was willing to work with the community to make sure that we put the tenants and allocated to affordable housing units that are truly affordable to the local area. And so we recommended the application and thank you again for the applicant to work for working with them.

[Speaker 1] (4:57:56 - 4:58:04)
Thank you. Alderman questions for Alderman Ciccio Lopez or the applicant hearing none. Can I get a motion?

[Speaker 37] (4:58:06 - 4:58:08)
So move. Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (4:58:08 - 4:58:24)
Alderman Roboius moves to pass on the motion by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that motion? Hearing none.

The item is passed. Thank you. And I think that's it for Mr. Moore. Is that correct?

[Speaker 24] (4:58:24 - 4:58:25)
Thank you very much. Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (4:58:26 - 4:58:59)

I don't see it. Well, can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you.

Let's go. Can you see me now?

[Speaker 1] (4:59:26 - 4:59:27)
Yes, we do. Okay.

[Speaker 22] (4:59:27 - 5:01:06)
All right. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Anthony Ferguson and I'm an attorney at the law firm of Miller and Ferguson, and we represent the applicant, Timothy J.

Rand. And Mr. Rand is the applicant and owner of bacon parcel at 8,500 dash 8532 South Chicago Avenue. Mr. Rand proposes to build on the vacant lot, a new factory for the purpose of building and establishing a cannabis business, which include cannabis cultivation center, cannabis craft brewer, cannabis infuser, and cannabis processor. The building will be approximately 32 feet on 22 feet high. 81 feet wide and a total length of 220 feet of approximately 18,000 square feet. And also provide 34 parking space.

The applicant also owns the vacant parcel across the street at 8,501 dash 8525 South Chicago Avenue. And that site will be developed for all site parking of 32 cars. We have spoken with the Alderman and we have the Alderman support.

We have received community feedback and received positive reviews, except for out of 25 interviews. We only had two negative reviews. We asked that the committee approved the changing from the current zoning M one dash two to the proposed M two dash two.

[Speaker 1] (5:01:08 - 5:01:16)
Thank you, Mr. Ferguson questions by the committee members. I see Harry Osterman's hand is up. Alderman Osterman.

[Speaker 48] (5:01:18 - 5:01:26)
Just a question. Has the property owner or the people that he's building this for been granted the license?

[Speaker 22] (5:01:27 - 5:02:19)
Yeah. No, no, no. Alderman the, the applicant is, is applied for the license and my client to give you some background.

My client is, is in the food and beverage industry and has operated restaurants and venues at Midway airport. He's also in the gaming industry as well as the hospitality industry is also the sponsor of the Chicago football classic and has ties to many of the South South side communities. The purpose of this application is not only for the cannabis event that he's unsuccessful.

His plan is to develop a manufacturing facility that supports his food and beverage industry operations. Okay. Thank you.

Thank you. Other questions.

[Speaker 1] (5:02:19 - 5:02:21)
Alderman Walter Burnett.

[Speaker 7] (5:02:23 - 5:03:14)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. Duran Duran brothers are upstanding citizens in the city of Chicago in particular, an African American community, very charitable, some real role models. Matter of fact, their family lineage is that they were the only African American company to transport alcohol back in the days.

And and, and they have been given back to the community from way back. So it would be a great pleasure and joy to see them have one of these cannabis licenses. So I hope they get it.

I support this zoning change.

[Speaker 2] (5:03:15 - 5:03:16)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (5:03:18 - 5:03:19)
Alderman Ray Lopez.

[Speaker 2] (5:03:22 - 5:03:40)
Thank you, chairman. If you want to just join my colleague Alderman Burnett, the brands are wonderful people and partners in our community as well. And I have the full faith that anything that they touch will be a great benefit to the community and look forward to supporting this as well.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (5:03:40 - 5:03:43)
Thank you. Alderman. Any more questions, comments?

[Speaker 51] (5:03:49 - 5:04:13)
Someone else has their comment on it. Yes, chairman. This is Anna Robles here at DPT.

Anna. Yes. The applicant or representing attorney applied for a substitute ordinance to correct the boundary only.

And I just wanted to let you know and make sure that gets taken care of.

[Speaker 1] (5:04:13 - 5:04:16)
Do we need to have a substitute is what you're saying or not?

[Speaker 51] (5:04:17 - 5:04:18)
Yes, sir.

[Speaker 2] (5:04:18 - 5:04:21)
We'll accept the substitute Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 1] (5:04:21 - 5:04:22)
Okay. All right.

[Speaker 2] (5:04:22 - 5:04:24)
Let me second.

[Speaker 1] (5:04:28 - 5:05:14)
So Alderman Burnett and Lopez moves to accept the substitute by the same roll call. It was used to determine quorum objections to that hearing none. The substitute is accepted and now on the motion.

I knew my motion Lopez moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum on the ordinance, the substitute ordinance, any objections hearing none. The substitute, the ordinance is passed as amended. Thank you for that catch.

Anna. Okay. And I think that's it for Mr. Ferguson.

[Speaker 22] (5:05:14 - 5:05:17)
Yes, it is. Thank you. We'll come back and join us.

[Speaker 1] (5:05:17 - 5:05:19)
We don't see you often enough. Okay.

[Speaker 22] (5:05:19 - 5:05:21)
All right, sir. Thank you much. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (5:05:21 - 5:05:58)
Members of the committee top of page nine document number 20515 in the 10th ward. The ordinance was referred on September 9th of 2020. The common address 97 37 South Torrance Avenue.

The change request from an M 1 1 limited manufacturing business park district to an M 2 1 light industry district Fred Augustine Fred Alderman Yes. I can hear you.

[Speaker 23] (5:05:59 - 5:07:32)
Can you see me? Yes. Now we're good.

All right. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. For the record.

My name is Fred Augustine. I'm the attorney on this matter with offices at 33 North. So I'm here today on behalf of the applicant.

We'll send property management LLC applicant owns the property at 97 37 South Torrance property contains around 61,000 square feet and is currently used as truck storage. We are here seeking rezoning from the current M 1 1 limited manufacturing business park district to an M 2 1 light industry district. So, Mr. Chairman, prior to the pandemic, the applicant received numerous interest from cannabis businesses seeking to lease the property. One of the issues at that time was the fact that the M 1 didn't even permit a cannabis business, even as a special use. So, but once COVID-19 hit, everything shut down the interest from these businesses and went away. The applicant is hoping to ramp up that interest and to help with that.

We are seeking rezoned the property to an M 2 1 district. And even if the committee approves the rezoning, the potential user will still need to comply with the cannabis zoning ordinance and still seek a special use approval as well as a community meeting. So with that, we have worked with Alderman Garza and her office on this matter.

She's fine with the zoning change. You should have a letter of support from her office. I'm here to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (5:07:34 - 5:08:17)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman, Alderwoman Sedlowski Garza. Questions by committee members. Hearing none.

Can I get a motion? Alderman Capelman makes the motion to pass this ordinance by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that?

Hearing none. The item is passed. All right.

Fred will move to the middle and committee members will move to the middle of page nine and that's document number two. You know what?

[Speaker 50] (5:08:18 - 5:08:19)
Yeah.

[Speaker 1] (5:08:19 - 5:08:39)
You know what? Document number two Oh five one four T one 44th ward ordinance was referred to on September 9th of 2020. Common address is 33 43 North holisted street.

A change request is a C one, two neighborhood commercial district to a C one, three neighborhood commercial district, Fred.

[Speaker 23] (5:08:40 - 5:09:39)
All right. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Again, Fred Augustin on the attorney on this matter.

I'm here today on behalf of the applicant, and Harley Properties LLC. Applicant owns the property at 3343 North Halstead. Property is a short lot.

It only contains 2,941 square feet and it's currently approved with a partially built four-story mixed-use building. We are seeking rezoning from the current C-1-2 district to a C-1-3 commercial district. The reason for this change is that we want to add around 470 square feet to the commercial space.

And since we have a short lot, we are capped in terms of FAR under the C-1-2 district. So going to a C-1-3 district will allow us to add that additional square footage. We have worked with your office, Chairman Toney, as well as we presented before the Triangle Community Group.

The community group was in support of this change. We're here to answer any questions the committee may have.

[Speaker 1] (5:09:42 - 5:10:01)
Questions by committee members? All right. I'm going to ask Alderman Roboius to make the motion after I speak on it.

Unfortunately with Zoom, it's not as coordinated, but- It is coordinated. On my part, on my part.

[Speaker 27] (5:10:02 - 5:10:03)
I got it here.

[Speaker 1] (5:10:03 - 5:10:22)
All right, so- As the alderman on this, this is a very minor change. It's consistent with the trends on the block. And they did meet with the community organization and got their full support as the chamber themselves.

So as the alderman, I ask for your positive consideration on this.

[Speaker 37] (5:10:24 - 5:10:32)
All right. Any members out there pass by the same motion as a quorum? Any, anyone, everyone in favor?

[Speaker 18] (5:10:33 - 5:10:35)
So- Alderman Cardona.

[Speaker 37] (5:10:36 - 5:10:40)
Okay. All in favor, say aye. Committee chairs, say aye.

[Speaker 1] (5:10:40 - 5:11:16)
Aye. Thank you. Thank you.

Thank you, members. All right. Now we're bottom of page nine, document number 20513-T1, 47th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on September 9th of 2020. Let's see. The address, the common address is 4253 North Walcott Avenue to change request RS3, residential single unit detached house district to an RT3.5 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district.

[Speaker 23] (5:11:17 - 5:12:17)
Fred, you're up. All right. Thanks again, Mr. Chairman. Turning on this matter, I'm here today on behalf of the applicant, 4253 Walcott LLC. Applicant owns the property at 4253 North Walcott. It is currently improved with a two-story residential building with a basement as well as two dwelling units.

We are here seeking rezoning from the current RS3 district to an RT3.5 district. The existing two-story building will remain. The reason for this change is to convert the existing basement into a dwelling unit.

So when complete, we will have a total of three dwelling units within the existing building. We have worked with Alderman Martin and his office on this matter. We did present before the 47th Ward Zoning Advisory Committee, as well as a local community group.

All were in support of the zoning change, and you should have a letter of support on your file from the Alderman's office. So I'm here to answer any questions the committee may have at this time.

[Speaker 1] (5:12:17 - 5:12:40)
Right. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Martin. Questions by committee members.

Can I get a motion? Alderman Cardona moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that motion?

Hearing none, the item is passed. All right.

[Speaker 12] (5:12:40 - 5:12:41)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (5:12:42 - 5:13:08)
Page 10, item number 20464, 11th Ward, ordinance was referred on September 9th of 2020. The common address, 838 through 842 West 35th Street. Change request, B11 neighborhood shopping district to a B31 community shopping district.

We have Karen Shaw, I believe.

[Speaker 42] (5:13:09 - 5:14:49)
Yes, good afternoon. Karen Shaw on behalf of Schiller Prayer Gerard and Samuels. We're here today seeking a zoning amendment for the property located at 838-842 West 35th Street.

We're seeking a change from a B1-1 to a B3-1 to allow for the establishment of a motor vehicle and repair shop, excluding body work. We do have the support from the alderman and community support. The property is currently unused, but is built as a existing motor vehicle repair shop, which has been unused for a few years.

And it just requires some minor cosmetic repair to the inside and a little bit of cleaning on the, I'm sorry, minor repair to the outside and a little bit of cleaning on the inside. The proposed project, as you see, the slides just went through here, is to build a motor vehicle repair shop. It will have 15 parking spaces.

There will be no residential use. The square footage will be approximately 11,031.8 square feet and the project will make the unused building productive it will add a cleaner look to the neighborhood. We'll create about three to maybe four jobs.

The owner is committed to providing employment at or above $15 per hour. And with that being said, we seek the support of this committee and open it up to any questions.

[Speaker 1] (5:14:50 - 5:15:08)
Okay. We have a letter of support from Alderman Thompson, questions from committee members. I have a quick question, Karen.

This was a motor vehicle place? Correct. And you're establishing it?

And then- I'm sorry? And you're re-establishing it?

[Speaker 42] (5:15:09 - 5:15:10)
Correct, re-establishing it.

[Speaker 1] (5:15:10 - 5:15:31)
Okay. And why are you excluding body work just, or people like that? Because isn't that pretty typical?

I mean, I know what I've had to deal with in my ward where they were doing stuff, they didn't have the proper license and we had to go back and do a zoning change on it. So I'm just wondering why you're excluding that. It looks pretty self-contained, so.

[Speaker 42] (5:15:32 - 5:15:56)
Sure. As far as I, my understanding is the business owner, they have been in operation for several years. Their business model is simply repair, no body work.

I believe that it's because the body work is too messy and they invite people from the community to participate in repair projects in motor vehicles. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (5:15:58 - 5:16:59)
That's my only question and comment. Any other questions from committee members? Hearing none, Alderman Raboyas moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

So moved. Any objections to that? Hearing none, item is passed.

Thank you. Thank you very much. Okay.

Middle of page 10, item number 20465, 11th Ward. Ordinance was referred on September 9th of 2020. Common address, 3501 South Union.

Change request, RS3, residential single unit detached house district and RT4, residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district. So we have Salvatore Papalito, I believe. You got it.

[Speaker 17] (5:16:59 - 5:17:39)
That sounds good. Okay. Proceed.

Hello, Mr. Chairman and committee. As you stated, my name is Salvatore Papalito. I am the owner of the address in question at 3501 South Union Avenue.

We are seeking a zoning change from RS3 to RT4 for a new construction of a three-story masonry residential building, three parking spots and back. We did have a community meeting back in March. We did not have any pushback on it.

We do have a letter of support from Alderman Thompson that you should be in possession of. And that is basically it. If there's any questions, please let me know.

[Speaker 1] (5:17:41 - 5:17:52)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Thompson. Any questions for the applicant? Can I get a motion?

[Speaker 17] (5:17:53 - 5:17:54)
So moved to pass, Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 1] (5:17:55 - 5:18:39)
Alderman Lopez moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Thank you. Okay. Now we're on the bottom of page 10, standing in the 11th ward.

Item number 20489-T1. The ordinance was referred on September 9th of 2020. This common address is 3315 to 3319 South Morgan and the change request is an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to a B12 neighborhood shopping district.

And we have Richard Toth.

[Speaker 39] (5:18:41 - 5:18:57)
Richard. Good afternoon, Chairman Toney, members of the zoning committee. Hopefully you can hear me.

Loud and clear. My name is Richard Toth. I'm an attorney at Daly and Georges in Chicago.

You unmuted yourself.

[Speaker 59] (5:18:58 - 5:19:00)
Now you gotta unmute now.

[Speaker 1] (5:19:01 - 5:19:02)
Richard, we lost you.

[Speaker 39] (5:19:03 - 5:20:53)
Hey, should be back online. Appearing on behalf of the applicant, 3315, 3319 South Morgan, we are seeking a zoning change from RS3 to B12. The applicant is part of the Joe family, which includes artists and curators of Joe B.

Art Center on 35th Street. The application relates to three standalone but adjacent lots on South Morgan Street. Two of the lots, 3315 South Morgan and 3317 South Morgan contain existing buildings that are just being renovated in part to have ground floor business uses.

Each building will have two dwelling units on upper floors. For 3315 South Morgan, by the way, that reduction is from an original six dwelling units down to two dwelling units. The current R zoning is an impediment to the proposed ground floor commercial uses, which does reflect the original intent and design of the buildings and the historical use and also is desired by the community.

The third lot, 3319 South Morgan does not have an existing building and the rezoning will allow the construction of a new four story building with ground floor commercial uses again and two upper floor dwelling units. The applicant is pursuing this application as a type one rezoning. We didn't have any changes to that.

The Alderman, the applicant vetted the work and the proposed new building with Alderman Patrick Thompson, who did host an online community meeting to present the proposal to neighbors. That meeting went very well and I believe you received the Alderman's letter of support for the requested zoning change. We can try to answer any questions, but on behalf of the applicant, we do request your favorable recommendation and we thank you for your time.

[Speaker 1] (5:20:54 - 5:21:06)
Okay, we do have a letter of support from Alderman Thompson. Do we have any questions from community members or committee members? Hearing none, can I get a motion?

[Speaker 37] (5:21:06 - 5:21:07)
So moved, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (5:21:09 - 5:21:19)
Alderman Roboyes, moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

[Speaker 39] (5:21:20 - 5:21:21)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (5:21:21 - 5:21:47)
Thank you, Mr. Richard. Now we're on the top of page 11. Staying in the 11th ward, item number 20491-T1.

The ordinance was referred in September 9th of 2020. Common address is 3022 South Archer Avenue. The change request is a C12 neighborhood commercial district to a B23 neighborhood mixed use district.

Mark Kubiak.

[Speaker 20] (5:21:48 - 5:23:07)
Yes, Mr. Chairman, thank you. My name is Mark Kubiak. I'm an attorney with offices at 77 West Washington and I represent the applicant.

The applicant owns a subject property. We're asking for zoning change from a C1-2 to a B2-3. This property is a transit serve location.

We're asking for the zoning change so we can take a minimum lot area reduction because it's a transit serve location. Also looking to obtain parking relief. Again, because it is a transit serve location and it's transit serve because it's in close proximity to the Orange Line station at Ashland Avenue, right off Archer Avenue there.

And the purpose is to convert an existing building and the existing building is built lot line to lot line. So the existing building has no onsite parking. So to convert the existing building, repair and remodel it so that we'd have a commercial unit on the ground floor and eight dwelling units throughout the rest of the building.

Alderman Thompson did ask for a community meeting. We did have a community meeting where we explained the project and answered the questions. And we followed up with the Alderman and his staff.

And I do believe that you have his letter of support.

[Speaker 1] (5:23:10 - 5:23:14)
Doesn't he need a substitute narrative? Mark, I'm sorry.

[Speaker 20] (5:23:14 - 5:23:16)
Yes, thank you.

[Speaker 1] (5:23:16 - 5:23:19)
We need to move a substitute narrative and plans correct for the type one?

[Speaker 20] (5:23:19 - 5:23:32)
Yes, this was filed as a type one. There was a small change to the plans. So we did file substitute plans and a substitute narrative.

So I would ask you if we could proceed on the substitute plans and narrative.

[Speaker 1] (5:23:33 - 5:23:57)
So Alderman Reboyas moves to accept the substantive narrative plans application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to Alderman Reboyas' motion? Hearing none, the substantive narrative and plans are accepted.

And now we'll, if you're finished, Mark.

[Speaker 20] (5:23:57 - 5:23:59)
I am, yes, thank you.

[Speaker 2] (5:23:59 - 5:24:01)
Motion to accept the substitute.

[Speaker 1] (5:24:02 - 5:24:03)
Okay, we got the substitute on.

[Speaker 2] (5:24:04 - 5:24:05)
Japan says substitute.

[Speaker 1] (5:24:06 - 5:24:11)
Okay, a letter of support from Alderman Thompson. And who made that motion?

[Speaker 2] (5:24:12 - 5:24:13)
Nope, Raymond Lopez.

[Speaker 1] (5:24:13 - 5:24:47)
Oh, okay. So Raymond, Ray Lopez moves to pass on the substantive narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to his motion on passing this substantive narrative?

Hearing none, this item is passed with the narrative and plans of the substantive narrative and plans. Thank you.

[Speaker 20] (5:24:48 - 5:24:49)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (5:24:49 - 5:25:22)
We're gonna stay with Mark, I believe. We're item number 20472T1, 17th Ward. Ordinance was referred on September 9th of 2020.

Common address is 1355 through 59 West 79th Street and also 7901 through 11 South Loomis Boulevard. Change request, RS1 residential single unit detached house district and a B12 neighborhood shopping district to a unified B12 neighborhood shopping district. Mark.

[Speaker 20] (5:25:23 - 5:26:24)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My name is Mark Kupiec. I'm an attorney with offices of 77 West Washington, represent the applicant.

And as you mentioned, this is a split zoning district and we're looking to rezone it to a unified district of a B1-2. The property has already improved with a restaurant building and previously had a tenant operating a restaurant in that building. But that tenant left about two years ago when the current tenant went in recently and applied for a business license.

He was told that it's a split zoning district and we'd have to rezone it before he could apply for that license. The applicant has met with Alderman Moore, described the problem and the plan, did discuss with the Alderman making some interior modifications to the building, also ensuring that there are some healthy items on the menu. And we followed up with Alderman Moore to ask for his support.

And I would question, is he perhaps on the call today?

[Speaker 1] (5:26:26 - 5:26:41)
First of all, we have this letter of support. Let's see if Alderman Moore is on the, I don't believe he is here to respond, but we do have his letter of support.

[Speaker 7] (5:26:41 - 5:26:41)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (5:26:42 - 5:26:44)
With that, I think we can continue.

[Speaker 20] (5:26:45 - 5:26:54)
Actually, that's all I have. It's really a licensing matter. And with the zoning change, the applicant would be able to put a new tenant in there to operate a restaurant.

[Speaker 1] (5:26:54 - 5:26:56)
And do we have a new tenant, Mark?

[Speaker 20] (5:26:57 - 5:27:03)
Yes, he does have a new tenant. The tenant applied for the license and that's where they discovered the split zoning lot problem.

[Speaker 1] (5:27:04 - 5:27:06)
Is that what's called Jimmy's best?

[Speaker 20] (5:27:09 - 5:27:10)
Yes. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (5:27:11 - 5:28:12)
All right. All right. Any other questions from committee members?

All right. Hearing no questions, can I get a motion? So moved.

Alderman Roboius moves, do pass on a motion by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Raise that please. Hearing none, the item is passed.

All righty. Now we're on the bottom of page 11. Number 20496-T1, 38th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on September 9th of 2020. The common address is 4416 through 4420 North Austin Avenue. The change request, an RS2, residential single unit detached house district to a B2-3 neighborhood mixed use district.

Mark, you wanna talk about this application please?

[Speaker 20] (5:28:12 - 5:28:47)
Absolutely. Thank you. My name is Mark Kupiec.

I'm an attorney with offices at 77 West Washington. And I represent the applicant contract purchaser of the subject property. The subject property, and first of all, we did file this as a type one application and there was a small change to the plan.

So we did submit substitute plans and a substitute narrative to the zoning department. And if one of your committee members would be good enough, we'd like to proceed on the substitute plans and narrative.

[Speaker 1] (5:28:51 - 5:29:04)
Alderman Villegas moves to accept the substantive narrative plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the substitute is in front of us and accepted.

[Speaker 20] (5:29:05 - 5:29:42)
Subject property actually is already improved with a parking lot. We're told the parking lot was previously used as a accessory parking lot for a bank that moved from the site about eight years ago. So the plan is to redevelop the property and build a nine unit residential building on the subject property.

This is an Alderman Sposato's ward at his request. We did do a community meeting at a local park. We explained the project and answered the questions.

We followed up with the Alderman and his staff. And I do believe that you have his letter of support.

[Speaker 1] (5:29:43 - 5:29:46)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Sposato.

[Speaker 20] (5:29:48 - 5:29:50)
So with that, we'd ask for your recommendation.

[Speaker 1] (5:29:50 - 5:29:58)
All right, questions on this one. Hearing none, can I get a motion?

[Speaker 32] (5:29:59 - 5:30:00)
Motion move Cardona.

[Speaker 1] (5:30:01 - 5:30:20)
Alderman Cardona makes the motion to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. All those in, any objections to that? I'm sorry.

Hearing none, the item is passed with a substantive narrative and plans. And we're gonna defer to the next.

[Speaker 11] (5:30:20 - 5:30:21)
Thank you.

[Speaker 37] (5:30:22 - 5:30:26)

[Speaker 39] (5:30:26 - 5:30:28)
He's up but we're deferred.

[Speaker 1] (5:30:29 - 5:30:29)
This one?

[Speaker 39] (5:30:30 - 5:30:30)
Yep.

[Speaker 1] (5:30:30 - 5:31:06)
Okay. On the next, I'm gonna read this one. This is item number 20421, 14th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on June 17th of 2020. Common address is 3330 to 3356 West 51st Street. Change request from an M12 Limited Manufacturing Business Park District to an M22 Light Industry District.

Mr. Kupiak, are we deferring this item?

[Speaker 20] (5:31:07 - 5:31:10)
Yes, Mr. Chairman. I think we have a little mix up on letter of support. So I'd like to defer it.

[Speaker 1] (5:31:11 - 5:31:13)
Okay. So.

[Speaker 2] (5:31:15 - 5:31:18)
So moved, Chairman. Say that again. So moved.

[Speaker 1] (5:31:19 - 5:31:26)
So Alderman Lopez makes a motion to defer the previously read item. All in favor?

[Speaker 2] (5:31:27 - 5:31:28)
Aye. Aye.

[Speaker 1] (5:31:29 - 5:31:29)
Aye.

[Speaker 37] (5:31:29 - 5:31:31)
Any opposed? Aye.

[Speaker 1] (5:31:32 - 5:31:35)
Hearing no objections, the item has been deferred.

[Speaker 27] (5:31:35 - 5:31:36)
Yes, thank you.

[Speaker 1] (5:31:37 - 5:32:04)
All right, we're gonna have another deferred item here. Let me just read it into the record. Document number 20468, 26th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on September 9th of 2020. The common address is 2436 West Chicago Avenue. The change request, B12 Neighborhood Shopping District to a B23 Neighborhood Mixed Use District.

We have Scott Bornstein.

[Speaker 51] (5:32:04 - 5:32:07)
It's being deferred. He's not, he should not be on.

[Speaker 1] (5:32:07 - 5:32:08)
Who's deferring it?

[Speaker 51] (5:32:09 - 5:32:09)
The attorney.

[Speaker 1] (5:32:11 - 5:32:24)
So this is being deferred by the Alderman and the applicant. Are there questions on this deferral by committee members? No question.

And that is all. Alderman Moore, would you make a motion?

[Speaker 12] (5:32:25 - 5:32:25)
Yeah.

[Speaker 1] (5:32:25 - 5:32:27)
For the previously read item?

[Speaker 12] (5:32:27 - 5:32:29)
I make a motion to defer.

[Speaker 1] (5:32:29 - 5:32:35)
Alderman Moore makes that motion. All those in favor? Aye.

[Speaker 31] (5:32:36 - 5:32:37)
Aye. Aye.

[Speaker 1] (5:32:37 - 5:33:03)
Any opposed? Hearing no objections, this item has been deferred. All right.

So we're gonna try to get through the rest of this. We have a lot of deferrals, but in the interest of coordinating our committee members' time, the Finance Committee will reconvene at 3.30. Oh, it was supposed to reconvene at 3.30. It's going to reconvene after this meeting.

[Speaker 21] (5:33:03 - 5:33:14)
Okay, I'm sorry. It's Alderman Wagesbeck. We can't, yeah, we have to use the same Zoom.

So once zoning is done, we'll move into the quick meeting for finance.

[Speaker 1] (5:33:15 - 5:33:53)
Thank you, Chairman. And as Chairman Wagesbeck said, the finance will immediately follow this meeting. All right.

All right, top of page 13. In the 27th ward, item number 20492, T1. The ordinance was referred on September 9th of 2020.

Common address is 1352 West Lake. The change request, M23 Light Industry District to a DS3 Downtown Service District. Tim Barton.

[Speaker 17] (5:33:54 - 5:34:28)
Mr. Chairman, my name is Timothy Barton. I'm the attorney for the office of Attorney Thomas Raines at 20 North Wacker Drive. Mr. Chairman, this item is in the Kinsey Industrial Corridor and is being, the proposed change is from an M zone to a DS3 and this matter will have to be reviewed by the plan commission before it can go forward. So I would ask that you defer this.

[Speaker 1] (5:34:30 - 5:34:30)
All right.

[Speaker 17] (5:34:31 - 5:34:34)
Motion to defer, Chairman, to the plan.

[Speaker 1] (5:34:34 - 5:35:06)
All right, that was Alderman Ray Lopez makes a motion to defer the previously read item. Any questions on that? If not, all in favor of deferring.

Aye. Any opposed? Hearing no objection, deferred.

Has not gone to plan commission. All right. Any more surprises, Tim?

Because we're moving on into the 30th ward.

[Speaker 17] (5:35:06 - 5:35:07)
No, I don't think so.

[Speaker 1] (5:35:08 - 5:35:30)
All right. Item number 20498, 30th ward. Ordinance was referred on September 9th of 2020.

Common address is 3170 to 3174 North Milwaukee Avenue. The change request is a B11 neighborhood shopping district to a C22 motor vehicle commercial district, motor vehicle related commercial district.

[Speaker 17] (5:35:32 - 5:37:31)
Tim, would you like to explain this? Sure. Again, for the record, Timothy Barton with the office of attorney, Thomas Raines.

I'm here today representing Peter, Jack, and Marie Ball who are the members of an LLC that owns the property and is also the applicant for the rezoning amendment. They're seeking a rezoning to broaden range of uses for this site. It's a fairly narrow range of uses that are allowed in the B1.

The property is improved right now with a one story commercial building. There are existing white box tenant spaces that are in place for potential commercial users. There are four existing parking spaces at the site.

As I say, the current B1 zoning doesn't allow a broad range of uses. Possible tenants have looked at the site but have stated that the variety of activities is too limited. The proposed rezoning is intended to increase the number of allowed uses in order to attract more tenants.

The hope is that tenants can be found that could make this corner more active and less desolate than it currently is. The owner has vetted this with Alderman Roboivets who has issued a support letter, I believe is in your files. At the alderman's request, we contacted all of the voters within 400 feet of the property in addition to the property owners within 250 feet of the property.

That's all I have. I would ask for the committee's favorable recommendation.

[Speaker 1] (5:37:32 - 5:37:39)
Thank you, Tim. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Roboivets. I know he's on the call.

Ariel, would you like to end this?

[Speaker 37] (5:37:39 - 5:38:00)
Thank you. Thank you, Chairman. Yeah, the councilor actually stated the change of zoning there.

We're hoping to get some more uses out of the area and the adjusted change order is more reflective of what we wanna see. So I respectfully ask for your support on this matter before you.

[Speaker 1] (5:38:02 - 5:38:32)
Questions for the alderman or the applicants? Hearing none, can I get a motion? It's a move, Chairman.

Ray Lopez makes the motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

All right, Vice Chair Roboivets, you wanna take over the chair on the next application in the 44th ward, please?

[Speaker 37] (5:38:32 - 5:39:01)
Yes, Mr. Chairman. That number of the item is 20497T1 in the 44th ward. Ordinance was referred in September 9th, 2020.

The common address is 3407-09 North Bosworth Avenue. Change request is RT3.5 residential two flat townhomes and multi-unit district to RM4.5 residential multi-unit district.

[Speaker 17] (5:39:02 - 5:41:18)
Council? Mr. Chairman. Hello, my name is Timothy Barton.

I'm the attorney with the offices of attorney Thomas Raines at 20 North Wacker Drive. I am here today representing Rafid Pindo, who is the applicant for this project. Subject property consists of two parcels currently improved with two existing two unit residences.

The site is immediately adjacent to the CTA Brown Line L tracks. The applicant proposes to demolish both of these buildings and combine them into a single lot of 6,200 square feet. A three-story masonry six dwelling unit building is being proposed.

It will have lower level and rooftop open space patio areas designated for each of the tenants. The total floor area for the building will be 10,344 square feet. The ground floor dwelling units will be duplex to the basement below.

The design has sunken below grade open terraces at the front and rear of the building. The front terrace would be screened from the public way with a permanent masonry landscape planter adjacent to the front property line. There will be six outdoor parking spaces.

The building height will be 40 feet. Variations will be requested to reduce the rear yard setback from 37 and a half feet to 28 feet, nine inches. And a second variation will be to establish a below grade terrace within the front yard setback.

Plans for the project were sent to the West Lakeview neighbors earlier in the year and no comments were received back. The project has been posted on the 44th board website for the past month. With that, I have no further statement.

If you want, I would appreciate the committee's recommendation of support.

[Speaker 37] (5:41:19 - 5:41:29)
All right, thank you, Council Barton. Members of the committee, any questions? Subject matter.

Alderman Tunney, 44th ward.

[Speaker 1] (5:41:30 - 5:42:45)
Thank you. As an alumnus of the 44th ward, vice chair, I know you know where Bosworth is. I'm thinking of moving there.

In regards to this application, this is literally south of the train, the brown line elevated there. And there's two very dilapidated frame structures on there. And then there's the corner that would be Bosworth and Roscoe where there was a formerly church that's a multi-unit corner building.

So we believe that the buffers on each side allows this zoning change to be permitted as was stated by Mr. Barton. We have really not heard that any opposition from the West Lakeview community, albeit with COVID, they've been somewhat hibernating themselves. So I believe it's in the best interests of this particular location to allow the increased density on this parcel.

And I urge support of my committee members.

[Speaker 37] (5:42:46 - 5:42:49)
Thank you. Thank you, Alderman Tunney. Any questions by committee members?

[Speaker 2] (5:42:50 - 5:42:57)
Move to adjourn, Alderman Lopez. Yes, senor.

[Speaker 37] (5:42:58 - 5:43:06)
Okay, Alderman Lopez makes a motion to pass. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

[Speaker 17] (5:43:08 - 5:43:09)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (5:43:09 - 5:43:40)
Thank you, Vice Chair. Now we're going to the top of page 14, document number 20487, T1, 36th Ward. The ordinance was referred on September 9th of 2020.

The address is 4437 West Armitage Avenue. The change request is a C11 neighborhood commercial district to a C11 neighborhood commercial district. Obviously we're looking at a change in the T1.

We have Carmen Rossi. Is Carmen?

[Speaker 59] (5:43:41 - 5:44:29)
Thank you, Chair and committee. Good afternoon. You guys can hear me, yes?

Yes, we can. Carmen Rossi, City Lake Law Attorney for the applicant, 19CC LLC. The subject property is 4437 West Armitage.

As you had said, this is a change from a C1 to a C1. So we're really just seeking a, that was in January of 19, January 23rd. We're just seeking a design change to the building.

And we do have the Alderman Villegas here who can speak to this property specifically or his support rather. And if there's any questions, happy to tender more information. Thank you, Carmen.

[Speaker 1] (5:44:29 - 5:44:32)
We have Alderman Villegas on the call, I believe.

[Speaker 57] (5:44:33 - 5:44:53)
Do you want to talk about this application in your ward? Chairman, thank you. I appreciate it.

Yeah, this is a property that's been vacant for quite some time. I had gained some momentum and then stalled. And now we're back on track.

And so I'm looking for favorable consideration from the members of the zoning committee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (5:44:54 - 5:45:03)
Questions for the Alderman or the applicant? I have a comment, Carmen. You're moving west on me here.

[Speaker 59] (5:45:04 - 5:45:08)
These are, during these most uncertain times, I have to do what I can.

[Speaker 57] (5:45:09 - 5:45:12)
Mr. Chairman, the real estate's a little bit cheaper, I'll just say so.

[Speaker 1] (5:45:12 - 5:45:20)
I don't disagree, but he's also down in River North, which is more expensive than Lakeview. So I'll just, I'll leave that one alone.

[Speaker 37] (5:45:21 - 5:45:22)
But there are deals in the 30th court.

[Speaker 1] (5:45:23 - 5:45:36)
Yeah, all right. All right, so it sounds like Alderman Ravoyos wants to make a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Is that right, Alderman Ravoyos?

[Speaker 37] (5:45:36 - 5:45:37)
That is correct, sir.

[Speaker 1] (5:45:37 - 5:45:44)
All right, any objections to that motion? Hearing none, the item is passed. Thank you very much.

[Speaker 59] (5:45:45 - 5:45:45)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (5:45:46 - 5:46:34)
All right, middle of page 14, document number 20511, 37th Ward, ordinance was referred on September 9th of 2020. Common address, 500 through 512 North Laramie Avenue, 5200 through 5214 West Kingman Street. And the change request, RS3 residential single unit detached house district to a C11 neighborhood commercial district.

And I believe we have Graham Grady. Graham, as always, I know it's an exciting project for our colleague in the 37th Ward. We got a lot of people waiting for the finish of this meeting and the finance.

But I can see Emma already smiling from ear to ear. And I know this went to planning commission, so it's pretty exciting for the Alderman.

[Speaker 58] (5:46:36 - 5:47:37)
Graham. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My name is Graham Grady with the law firm of Taft, Stettinius, and Hollister.

We filed this application on behalf of By the Hand Club for Kids to accommodate the proposed development of a new two-story headquarters and cafe building for the applicant's headquarters and administrative offices. By the Hand Club for Kids is a highly regarded, life-enriching afterschool program which serves nearly 2,000 youth from Chicago communities, including Cabrini-Green, Alkyl-Murray, Englewood, and Austin. Danita Travis, the executive director and founder of By the Hand Club for Kids is on the Zoom call and is available to answer your questions.

Alderman Mitts has provided a letter of support for this application. At the beginning of today's hearing, during the public commentary period, Ms. Tasha Alexander provided testimony in support of the application. We are unaware of any opposition to the application.

We request the favorable consideration of the committee. We're available to answer questions.

[Speaker 1] (5:47:39 - 5:47:44)
Alderman Mitts. Chairman Mitts.

[Speaker 47] (5:47:44 - 5:49:14)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and to the members. I'm excited once again for the continuation by the Hand Club and the effort to help to revitalize the community. That they're doing so much, they feel the need that we need to put their office here now and also in doing so, creating an opportunity for the community to be able to go in and do work along with their headquarters working.

We will have a cafe, more recreation, another beautiful facility to really just change the dynamics and the looks of Laramie North of Lake Street. And I'm just waiting until they move a little further. So I just ask the committee members to please support this project.

It really means a lot to the neighborhood and the work that is being done by the Hand Club, the need to travel is just incredible. Working with kids, you have to have a vision for this. And I'm certainly glad that they want to put, move their headquarters to 37th Ward where we can look and see how we can make more improvements in the community.

So thank you so much. And I ask your favorable support for this project.

[Speaker 1] (5:49:15 - 5:49:23)
Thank you, Alderman. And may I stand corrected? This was not in front of the Planning Commission.

So we didn't have to incorporate any records. Is that correct?

[Speaker 58] (5:49:23 - 5:49:24)
That is correct, Chairman.

[Speaker 47] (5:49:25 - 5:49:39)
Okay. No, this was the church that was there that they'd taken over that location. Right.

Having worked with the church for some time and then we bought the property. All right.

[Speaker 1] (5:49:39 - 5:49:43)
Questions for the applicant or the alder woman?

[Speaker 2] (5:49:44 - 5:49:46)
We'll do past Chairman Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 1] (5:49:48 - 5:49:56)
Alderman Ray Lopez. It makes a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

[Speaker 37] (5:49:57 - 5:49:58)
So moved.

[Speaker 1] (5:49:59 - 5:50:02)
None, the item is passed. Congratulations. Thank you all so very much.

[Speaker 47] (5:50:03 - 5:50:03)
Thank you.

[Speaker 10] (5:50:04 - 5:50:04)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (5:50:04 - 5:50:38)
Now we're on the bottom of page 14, number 20471, 39th Ward. Ordinance was referred on September 9th of 2020. Common address is 6000 through 6022, North Stevens Avenue.

And 6005 through 6017, North Stevens Avenue. So it looks like we have both sides of the block. Okay.

Change request. B11 Neighborhood Shopping District to an M11 Limited Manufacturing Business Park District. And we have Paul Kolpak.

[Speaker 38] (5:50:40 - 5:51:52)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman. Stepping in for Mr. Kolpak today. My name is Colleen Doherty from Law Offices Kolpak and Girsik, located at 6767 North Milwaukee.

Here on behalf of the applicant, Ki-Wan Kwan. This afternoon, we are requesting an amendment from the B11 to M11 in order to legalize the existing property and maintain the existing business. The business is currently a wholesale distribution business.

It has existed as such for years. And the application is triggered purely due to a lapse in the owner's business license. The owner will not be making any changes to the building structure, its use, its business, or any of its current status.

We have discussed the change with the Peterson and Pulaski Business Industrial Council, who are in support of the rezoning. And we have also worked closely with Alderman Nugent and obtained a letter of support from Alderman Nugent that we have submitted to the committee as well. Be happy to answer any questions.

And we would ask for the committee's favorable recommendations this afternoon.

[Speaker 1] (5:51:52 - 5:51:59)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Nugent. And my only question, this is on both sides of Stevens, right?

[Speaker 38] (5:52:00 - 5:52:00)
It is.

[Speaker 1] (5:52:01 - 5:52:04)
Okay, great. All right, any other questions, comments?

[Speaker 51] (5:52:06 - 5:52:28)
Chairman, this is Anna Robles in DPD. Yes, Anna. Just wanted to point out, it was an error on the application.

The cross address is on Keystone, Keystone, 6005 Keystone, as opposed to two Stevens addresses. The ordinance is correct.

[Speaker 1] (5:52:28 - 5:52:30)
The ordinance was correct, Anna?

[Speaker 51] (5:52:31 - 5:52:34)
Yes, the ordinance is correct. Just an error on the app.

[Speaker 1] (5:52:35 - 5:52:43)
Okay. Okay, well, glad I brought it up. So we don't need to get a substitute, is that correct?

No. Okay, thank you, Anna.

[Speaker 51] (5:52:43 - 5:52:44)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (5:52:45 - 5:52:50)
Any more questions? If not, can I get a motion?

[Speaker 32] (5:52:53 - 5:52:54)
Do pass Cardona.

[Speaker 1] (5:52:55 - 5:53:09)
Alderman Cardona moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

All right, Colleen, are you sticking with us on the next item?

[Speaker 38] (5:53:10 - 5:53:11)
I am, Chairman.

The proposed development will include nine dwelling units, a roof deck, 14 parking spaces, and approximately 2,278 square feet of commercial space on the ground floor.

And I would like to request that the record of that proceeding be incorporated here today.

[Speaker 1] (5:56:23 - 5:56:38)
I will call the roll on Alderman Ravois moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the records are incorporated.

Continue, Mike.

Thank you very much. This is a technical amendment to a 2016 plan development. The building has already been constructed and we are amending it to add a use, cannabis in craft grow, infuse and process to the list of other approved uses for the building.

There is no tenant there as of yet, but we are hopeful that when licenses are awarded, the tenant might be able to be there. We have been through the community with success and not sure if Alderman Hopkins is on the line to speak to the matter, but he has a letter of recommendation on record with the committee.

[Speaker 1] (5:57:34 - 5:57:41)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Hopkins. I don't know if he is on the call. Still.

As you indicated, Mr. Chairman, this property is located at 4800-4858 South on Western and 2401-2559 West on 48th Street in the Brighton park neighborhood and is bounded by 48th Street on the north, Western Avenue on the east, the orange line to the south, and Rockwell Avenue and the Shields school to the west. The existing zoning, as you've indicated, is M2-2 and C1-2, and we're seeking to first amend the zoning to be M2-2 and C1-2, and then to a plan development to allow the Chicago park district to move their headquarters to this site.

Please note, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, this was before the Chicago plan commission on September 17, 2020, and I would ask at this time that the report of proceedings and the testimony and exhibits that were part of the proceedings before the Chicago plan commission be incorporated into and made a part of the proceedings before you today.

[Speaker 1] (6:00:46 - 6:00:59)
All in favor? Opposed? Carried.

district move to incorporate the records from the plan commission from the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the records are incorporated.

Continue, Mr. George.

[Speaker 16] (6:01:00 - 6:04:59)
Up on the screen right now is the site plan for the subject property. The site is 17 acres. It's a former industrial site at and 48th and Western Avenue.

And the Chicago Park District is proposing to construct a new headquarters building, which is the circular area on this slide. And it's a headquarters conjoined with a field house. The building will be set within a new community park, which will contain two artificial turf fields for soccer, football, and lacrosse.

There will be a great lawn that can be used for theater in the park, movies in the park and farmer's market. And then there'll be three recreational areas for the children, including a playground, a spray pool and a nature area. There's also a natural landscape of meadow and grasses with looping walking paths.

Part of the looping paths extend through the center of the building where there is an internal courtyard. The Chicago Park District has looked at multiple locations. Excuse me, what's up on the screen now is the rendering of the facility that I just described.

The Chicago Park District had looked at a number of locations for their new headquarters. And this particular site was chosen for a number of reasons, including the significant transformation value that the new headquarters will bring to the Brighton Park community, which is a community area in great need of open space. Further, the property is located adjacent to the Western Avenue Orange Line CTA and lies along the Western Avenue bus route, both of which are major routes in the city, making it well-served.

The Chicago Park District is engaged in both the local community meetings and other meetings. We've also been in contact with Alderman Burke and also Alderman Lopez, and Alderman Lopez whose ward bounds us on the east side. The Park District held a number of meetings with various different groups, the Back of the Yard Council, the Brighton Park Neighborhood Council, the Brighton Park Neighborhood Network Coalition.

In addition to that, we had a virtual meeting on August the 19th, and that went very well. All of the meetings that we had with all these different community groups were all done both in Spanish and in English, and we had English translators that were used during these meetings. As a result of the community has agreed to install, and Alderman Lopez brought this to my attention the first time I met with him, a traffic signal and pedestrian crossing enhancements at 48th Place to make sure that the community and anyone else coming to the headquarters can safely cross Western Avenue.

Environmental remediation of the site is also part of the project, and this has been enrolled in the EPA site remediation program, and so the Park District will complete the required remediation work and will install an engineered barrier at the park as part of the park construction, ensuring that the site is safe for the community projects. Also with respect to MBE and WBE, as with all projects and plan commission projects, there was a goal here of 26 and six, which we will be intending to achieve, as well as 50% residents for total construction work. Over the several months, the Park District has met extensively with the Chicago Fire Department, the Mayor's Office of People with Physical Disabilities, the Department of Planning, and all of them have approved of this project.

We believe that all of the requirements of the Chicago Plan Development Ordinance, as well as the Zoning Ordinance are complied with, and we would ask for your favorable recommendation. I would like to give special thanks to John Malloy and Noah Supranik from the Department of Planning who worked very hard on this project with us. All of us from the Chicago Park District stand here ready today to answer any questions that you, Mr. Chairman, or any members of the committee might have concerning the project. As you've indicated, this is a project that we are all really excited about. A lot of excitement was engendered when we appeared before the various groups, and we are very proud and happy for this project.

[Speaker 1] (6:05:02 - 6:05:08)
Thank you, Mr. George. I'd like to hear from Alderman Burke. I think this is it.

Yep, it's in the 14th Ward.

[Speaker 9] (6:05:09 - 6:05:09)
Alderman Burke.

[Speaker 1] (6:05:19 - 6:05:21)
Ed, you need to unmute yourself.

[Speaker 52] (6:05:24 - 6:06:36)
You got me now? Yes, sir. I'm enthusiastically supportive of this project, Mr. Chairman, and it has the potential to be a life-changing development for the area. As Mr. George pointed out, through several meetings, the response from the community has been very positive, and it really is an example of how the headquarters for the Chicago Park District is sensitive to the need to get out into the neighborhoods. They're now on the near north side. As Mr. George also pointed out, location on Western Avenue is immediately adjacent to the Orange Line Western Avenue stop, which provides excellent transportation. The community is excited about this, and I'm very happy to be able to support the project as I have from its initial announcement. Thank you for the opportunity to address the committee, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (6:06:37 - 6:06:39)
Thank you, Alderman. What an exciting project.

[Speaker 52] (6:06:40 - 6:06:40)
It really is.

[Speaker 1] (6:06:41 - 6:06:55)
We are all envious. I just like to have that open space. Nevermind the stunning architecture.

All right, do we have any other questions, comments? Alderman Ray Lopez would like to say a few words.

[Speaker 2] (6:06:57 - 6:08:36)
Thank you, Chairman. Thank you, members of the committee. I too wish to join our colleague Alderman Ed Burke in support of this.

We were there together when we first announced these plans with our Mayor Rahm Emanuel as part of his initiative to bring City Hall into the neighborhoods, and I think this is a beautiful coming to fruition of his dream to making that reality, and I am thankful that the Park District and Jack George have been able to work with the community extensively to listen to everyone's concerns and to incorporate them into something that will be a transformative benefit to the Brighton Park community.

I can't tell you how many residents just across the street are ecstatic at the idea of seeing such a huge and new investment in the community. I don't even think the word transformative accurately describes what we anticipate happening in the Brighton Park community, which so oftentimes is in the news for different reasons, but today we're in the news for something positive. Today we're in the news for the next generation of Chicago Park District leadership being a part of the community in the very communities it serves, and I would actually encourage all of my colleagues and the Mayor to continue to push for City Hall and its departments to no longer be cloistered in one central downtown location, but to continue building on what Mayor Emanuel sought out to do when he embarked upon this and other projects, which is to bring City Hall and its departments into the neighborhoods. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (6:08:37 - 6:08:37)
Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 2] (6:08:38 - 6:08:39)
And with that, I move to pass.

[Speaker 1] (6:08:40 - 6:09:00)
All right, no more questions. You heard the motion by Alderman Ray Lopez to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, the item is passed as revised. And again, my congratulations to both of you. It is very transformative.

[Speaker 16] (6:09:01 - 6:09:04)
All right. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee.

[Speaker 1] (6:09:05 - 6:09:35)
Thank you, Mr. George. Now we're on the top of page 16. We're on our last page, folks, I think.

Yeah, all right. This item is number 20463, 24th Ward. The ordinance was referred on July 22nd of 2020.

Common address is 2100 South Pulaski. This item is being deferred.

[Speaker 51] (6:09:38 - 6:09:39)
Alderman Scott.

[Speaker 1] (6:09:40 - 6:09:47)
Okay, this item is being deferred by Alderman Michael Scott. Any questions on that by committee members?

[Speaker 2] (6:09:50 - 6:09:52)
Do I get a motion? I'll move, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (6:09:54 - 6:10:00)
Alderman Ray Lopez makes the motion to defer the previously read item. All those in favor?

[Speaker 35] (6:10:01 - 6:10:01)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (6:10:02 - 6:10:27)
Any opposed? Hearing no objections, the item has been deferred. All right, middle of page 16, number 20442, 33rd Ward.

The ordinance was referred on July 22nd of 2020. Common address, 3557 West Lawrence Avenue. Change request, B3-2, Community Shopping District to B3-3, Community Shopping District.

Liz Butler.

[Speaker 14] (6:10:33 - 6:11:11)
All right, bear with me, starting my video. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Liz Butler from the law firm of DLA Piper, located at 444 West Lake Street in Chicago.

And I, along with my colleague, Mariah DeGreno, represent Celadon Holdings III, LLC, the applicant for a zoning map amendment for the property located at 3557 West Lawrence Avenue. As a preliminary housekeeping matter, we did submit a substitute ordinance narrative and plans for this matter, and we would ask that the committee consider those substitute materials.

[Speaker 1] (6:11:14 - 6:11:31)
So Alderman Cardona moves to amend the application to a type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is amended to a type one application and proceed.

Liz.

[Speaker 14] (6:11:32 - 6:16:40)
Thank you. I'm joined today by Scott Henry of Celadon Holdings III, the applicant, and Rob Natke of Urban Works, the project architect for this project. The applicant has been active as an affordable housing developer in Chicago for over 12 years and has worked with its community partner, Communities United in Albany Park, through its Roots Initiative for the past seven years.

You heard about six hours ago from Diane Lemus, who spoke in support of this project on behalf of the Community United organization. This applicant is committed to meeting the demand for desperately needed affordable housing in the Albany Park neighborhood. The DePaul Institute for Housing Studies identified Albany Park as a neighborhood with intensifying and emerging housing affordability pressure.

Albany Park is a neighborhood with vulnerable populations, rising prices, and housing that has become among the most expensive in the city. Because of this mix of conditions, this area is experiencing active displacement of lower income residents due to high and rising housing costs. This project that we're discussing with you today will provide 50 units of new affordable housing, including one, two, and three bedroom units for families earning 15%, 30%, 60%, and 80% of the area median income.

Importantly, the project that we're presenting today has been selected by the city of Chicago's Department of Housing for an allocation of 9% low income housing tax credits. The subject property that we're discussing is located at the southeast corner of West Lawrence Avenue and North Central Park Avenue, again at 3557 West Lawrence Avenue, which you hopefully can see on your screen, a rendering of the proposed development. The site is currently vacant and it's improved with a surface parking lot.

The applicant is proposing to develop the property with a mixed use multi-unit residential building. The development, like I mentioned, will provide 50 residential units on floors two through six, 13 vehicular parking spaces, 50 bicycle parking spaces, and one loading space. The building will measure 73 feet in height.

And in order to enable this development, as was previously mentioned, this applicant is seeking to rezone the property from its current B3-2 community shopping district to the B3-3 community shopping district. The five residential floors will each contain 10 units. Of those, half of the units are one bedroom units, 20 are two bedroom, and five are three bedroom units.

The developer also has a strategic partnership with Concordia Place, an early childhood care operator who will operate a childhood care center in the ground floor of the proposed building. Services for daycare and childcare will be offered to residents of the building at reduced rates. The property is a transit-served location.

It's located in close proximity to the Kimball L-Stop, and the project will utilize the transit-served location features of the Chicago Zoning Ordinance to allow both the proposed parking and the project residential density. The project will also seek approval from the Zoning Board of Appeals of very minor variations for setback relief along the alley. This project will redevelop a long vacant parcel with a development program that is designed to meet a critical shortage of affordable housing in Albany Park.

The project was thoroughly vetted by the community through the 33rd Ward's rigorous community-driven zoning and development review process. The applicant presented the project to the full CDZD committee on April 9th and July 28th. We conducted numerous developer-led one-on-one meetings with neighbors and neighborhood groups, and finally had a community-wide meeting on September 24th.

As a result of the feedback that was received through that community process, the project was scaled down from what was a seven-story building with 60 units to a six-story building with 50 units. Three bedrooms were added as a result of the community review process, and a variety of design changes were also implemented to make this project design more compatible and responsive to the neighborhood context. The alderman worked very closely with Alderman Rodriguez-Sanchez from the 33rd Ward and her staff.

We understand that the alderman is in support of this proposed zoning change, and we also understand that a letter of support has been issued and should be in your file. We respectfully request that this committee recommend city council approval of the application, and we appreciate the committee's time and consideration of this project. Our team is available to answer any questions that you may have, and we thank you.

[Speaker 1] (6:16:41 - 6:17:10)
Thank you, Liz. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Rodriguez-Sanchez. We also, in your packet, we did get a couple of objectors, the North River Youth Council, and it looks like Albany Park Neighbors.

We had two letters from those organizations. Is Alderman Rodriguez-Sanchez on the call?

[Speaker 9] (6:17:11 - 6:17:12)
Nope, but we do have her letter.

[Speaker 1] (6:17:12 - 6:17:19)
We do not have her on the call, but she has given us a letter of support. Questions from committee members?

[Speaker 17] (6:17:23 - 6:17:27)
Move approval on behalf of Alderman Rodriguez-Sanchez. So moved by Alderman David Moore.

[Speaker 1] (6:17:27 - 6:17:49)
All right, I can hear David Moore. David Moore makes the motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum, and any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed as amended to the type one.

All right. Thank you. Vice Chair Roboyes, are you there with us?

[Speaker 37] (6:17:50 - 6:17:56)
I am here. I have the pleasure of calling on it. Looks like the last item on today's agenda.

It is.

[Speaker 47] (6:17:56 - 6:17:57)
It is.

[Speaker 37] (6:17:57 - 6:18:28)
Okay, you're on. This is number, item number 205, 204, 5-4 in the 44th Ward, ordinance referred on 7-22-20. The common address is 1134 West Diversity Parkway.

The applicant is Basilios Capital. The attorney, Bertie Citron, and the change request is a C1-2, neighborhood commercial district to a B2-3, neighborhood mixed use district. Counsel.

[Speaker 43] (6:18:29 - 6:20:30)
Thank you, members of the committee. Bernard Citron from the law firm of Thompson-Coburn, representing Basilios Capital as the owner of this property. Basilios Capital purchased the property about two years ago.

The ground floor, this was originally developed with a ground floor commercial space along with three units above. It's a four-story building. When they purchased the property, the ground floor was occupied by a therapist office.

Unfortunately, even pre-COVID, that tenant moved out. Subsequent to that time, again, even pre-COVID, they were having a very difficult, if not impossible time to fill that commercial space. Subsequent to COVID, we are seeing in general in the industry, a lot of these very small commercial spaces and strip centers or in these types of buildings remaining vacant for long periods of time.

That's affecting very significantly the economic viability of this project. Very simply, they have a mortgage to pay on this property. We approached the alderman who immediately sent us to see Central Lakeview neighbors.

We ultimately had three meetings with Central Lakeview neighbors presenting our project. We're simply seeking to add one residential unit to this building on the ground floor to take the place of the commercial space that would otherwise, we believe, remain vacant. The property is TOD, transit-oriented in location, so the parking spaces that are on the property currently will suffice to serve what we hope to be four units in this property.

We entered into an agreement with CLVN regarding this, including that once the building permits are obtained to establish the residential space in the residential unit on the ground floor, this property will be re-zoned back down to its prior zoning district. With that, I stand ready to answer any questions that the committee may have.

[Speaker 37] (6:20:31 - 6:20:38)
Thank you, Bernie. Any questions by committee members? Okay, how about the alderman?

Is he available?

[Speaker 1] (6:20:38 - 6:21:21)
Thank you, Vice Chair. As Mr. Citron said, the trend on West diversity over here is moving towards more residential on the ground floor. And this is, as he said, this is the nature of the economy right now.

I don't foresee a changing in the near future. I'm almost on the record, not sure we want to return to C-1-2 because I think the long-term trend is going to be residential on the ground floor. But that being said, I asked for the committee's support on this.

As I said, it met with the neighbors three times over one small change request, but we got it done.

[Speaker 37] (6:21:22 - 6:21:34)
Thank you, alderman. There are no committee members, any questions by committee members? I hear a motion or is there a motion on the floor?

I'll move by Alderman Lopez. Moved by Alderman Lopez, makes a motion to pass. Any objections?

[Speaker 12] (6:21:35 - 6:21:40)
Hearing none, the item is passed. Jack to Chairman Toney, going to sleep now.

[Speaker 1] (6:21:42 - 6:22:57)
I'm back on the dais here. Thank you. So I think that concludes the regular agenda.

However, I want to bring it to everyone's attention that since the morning recess, I've gotten a number of questions and comments and interest to revisit the Clean Air Ordinance 020204590. I think I'm gonna ask this meeting to be in recess until 9 a.m. tomorrow morning, and we will have staff and the committee will provide time for those questions to be answered. And if it is the wish of the committee tomorrow morning after the 9 a.m. call, then we will take a possible vote on this item if it is the wish of the committee. So the committee will stand in recess until 9 a.m. tomorrow morning. Thank you very much. Okay, a motion to, no, we're not adjourning.

I'm sorry, we're recessing. We'll see you in the morning, folks. Okay.
