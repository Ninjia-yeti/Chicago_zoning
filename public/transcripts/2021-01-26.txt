[Speaker 4] (1:03 - 1:04)
Now I don't want to see myself again.

[Speaker 18] (1:08 - 1:09)

[Speaker 1] (1:17 - 3:40)
Morning Mr. Chairman. Everybody doing okay? Our neighborhoods are surviving.

All your residential streets are plowed yet or? They're still working the mains chairman. Yeah.

I was being, as you know, a little facetious, but let's see what we got here. The January 26th, 2021 committee on zoning landmarks and building standards is called to order. Pursuant to applicable law, the chairman has determined that an in-person meeting is not practical or prudent.

Accordingly, attendance at this meeting will be by remote means only. We will start off with a roll call committee. Members, please unmute yourself.

We'll start with Alderman Hopkins.

[Speaker 10] (3:41 - 3:43)

All right. We have Alderman Beal, are you on?

[Speaker 5] (5:09 - 5:11)
Alderman Beal is here, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (5:11 - 6:09)
We got you. Anybody else? All right, we have 16.

So the quorum is, we do have the quorum. All right, I would like to note that discussions are still continuing on document number DOC number 02020-4590, also known as the Clean Air Ordinance, and I'll be holding it in committee till a future date. All right, we'll now move on to the approval of the rule 45 reports containing the minutes of the December 15th, 2020 Committee on Zoning, Landmark and Building Standards hearing, as well as the December 15th, 2020 Joint Committee hearing with the Committee on Housing and Real Estate.

All members of the committee should have received copies of these reports electronically. And if hearing no objections, can I get a motion by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum to approve?

[Speaker 18] (6:09 - 6:10)
Riley, so moves.

[Speaker 1] (6:11 - 6:18)
Alderman Riley makes that motion. Any objections? Hearing no objections, these reports have been approved.

[Speaker 14] (6:19 - 6:29)
Mr. Chairman, point of order. Yes. Do you need a motion to defer on the Clean Air Ordinance or is just a simple announcement that you're holding it since it is on the agenda?

[Speaker 1] (6:30 - 6:33)
Yeah, I'm holding it. We don't need the vote on that.

[Speaker 14] (6:33 - 6:35)
No motion to defer is required?

[Speaker 1] (6:35 - 6:35)
Correct.

[Speaker 14] (6:36 - 6:37)
Okay, thank you.

[Speaker 1] (6:39 - 10:00)
All right, so now we'll be moving on to the items to be deferred. I'll read the ward, the file number, the address and page number, and we'll take a motion for all at the end. Starting on page six of the revised agenda and page eight of the regular agenda in the 31st ward, file number 20562 for the address commonly known as 3054 through 3058 North Costner.

On page nine of the revised agenda and page eight of the regular agenda in the 44th ward, file number 20586 for the address commonly known as 3436 through 3448 North Broadway. On page 13 of the revised agenda and page two of the regular agenda in the third ward, file number 20573 for the address commonly known as 2500 through 2548 South Wabash Avenue. On page 13 of the revised agenda and page two of the regular agenda in the third ward, file number 20585-T1 for the address commonly known as 2601 through 2625 South Wabash Avenue and also 43 through 63 East 26th Street.

Also on page 13, the revised agenda and page three of the regular agenda in the seventh ward, file number 20581 for the address commonly known as 10318 South Torrance Avenue. On page 14 of the revised agenda and page seven of the regular agenda in the 30th ward, file number 20576 for the address commonly known as 2400 through 2440 North Meade Avenue, also 6100 through 6138 West Fullerton Avenue. On page 14 of the revised agenda and page nine of the regular agenda in the 40th ward, file number 20574 for the area bounded by West Foster Avenue, North Francisco Avenue, North California Avenue and West Winona Avenue.

Moving on to page 15 of the revised agenda and page nine of the regular agenda, also in the 40th ward, file number 20575 for the address commonly known as 5200 through 5224 North Washtenaw Avenue, 2700 through 2712 West Foster Avenue and 2701 through 2711 West Farragut Avenue. And lastly, on page 15 of the revised agenda and page 10 of the regular agenda in the 42nd ward, file number 20572 for the address commonly known as 523 through 545 South Wabash Avenue, 63 through 69 East Ida B. Wells Drive and 50 through 66 East Harrison Street.

If I have no questions by committee members, can I get a motion to defer the previously listed items by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 18] (10:01 - 10:02)
Alderman Reilly so moves.

[Speaker 1] (10:02 - 10:37)
Alderman Reilly moves that motion. Any objections to that? Hearing no objections, these items have been deferred.

At this time, we will now begin the public comment period. Out of respect for everyone's time, each speaker is limited to three minutes to address all items on the agenda. This will be the only opportunity to address the items on the agenda and the committee will not conduct separate public comment periods for each agenda item.

And today we have seven speakers signed up and we will start.

[Speaker 58] (10:37 - 10:40)
Chairman, if you took roll call, Alderman David Moore is here.

[Speaker 1] (10:40 - 10:48)
Thank you, David, we'll add you to the roll call. All right, our first speaker in the public comment period is Tramell Williams.

[Speaker 49] (10:52 - 12:28)
Greetings, greetings, good morning committee and other members of this council. First off, my name is Tramell Williams of Elite Mind Management. I wanna say, first off, happy 2020.

I think this is the first meeting that the Committee on Landmark and Zoning is having this year, if I'm not mistaken. And if you guys don't have it on your agenda to discuss today, I wanna put it on your hearts to remember our three initiatives over here, Black Heroes Matters, as I am the chair of entertainment over here. Our initiative is simply, we wanna honor Chicago's founding father, Jean Baptiste Pointe Du Sable.

Specifically with this committee, you guys do have the power, as we have been in discussions with a few of the committee members and a few of the Lightfoot's administration, but you guys do have the power to execute on or assist in executing on one of our initiatives, which is the erection of a 25-foot statue or more of Chicago's founding father. We do know it's a budget deficit. We are well aware of that, as we have been in communication with you guys.

We do wanna make sure as this year starts off in this first quarter, that you guys please, please, those of you who are in favor of our initiative, that you please keep it on your hearts that that is something that does need to be addressed and discussed in this committee moving forward for any further meetings. The erection of a major monument for Chicago's founding father, Jean Baptiste Pointe Du Sable. Appreciate the time that you're giving me for public comment this morning.

And all I ask that you guys keep that on your heart. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (12:28 - 12:33)
Thank you. Our next speaker is Ephraim Martin. Ephraim.

[Speaker 32] (12:37 - 15:17)
To Adam, Anthony, Thomas, Tony and members of the city council committee and zoning landmarks and building. Good morning. Again, this is Ephraim Martin, president of Martins International, whose objectives include bringing nations together through music and culture.

Also the chairman of the Black Heroes Matter Coalition, which is calling for the injustices to Jean Baptiste Pointe Du Sable, Chicago's founding father to be corrected and for the Outer Lakeshore Drive to be renamed Du Sable Drive. In addition, we're asking for a full city holiday and a major monument for Du Sable about which we are in discussion with the city administration. Adam and Tony, first, can you tell us where are the Du Sable zone landmark and building?

We the people are having a Du Sable discriminatory emergency. The Black Heroes Matter Coalition trust that Alderman Howard Brookings will on this coming February Black History Month call a vote and council members Moore and King-Arden to rename the Outer Lakeshore Drive from Hollywood in the North to 67th Street to the South as Du Sable Drive. Mr. Chairman, we're asking all members serving on your committee who are also on the transportation committee to vote yes when the order comes up for a vote in the transportation committee and for a vote in the full city council. I am almost sure our council members would agree that after 240 years, it is time to show a little love for the founding father who gave us Chicago. This man who was a great right arm uniter who negotiated settlement between rival ethnic and cultural groups so they could live together as one in this land called Chicago. Chicago must be a land of equal rights and justice where we all can live together as one people with no uptown or downtown, but a place where we all can survive together combined as one.

The Outer Lakeshore Drive as Du Sable Drive will link the North with the South and serve to unite all of us as one people which can cultivate a racial restoration of the city and set us on a road toward ending systemic racism in this great city. We thank you all and we trust that you will help us to make sure we achieve these objectives before long as we're in a time limit. Thank you very much.

You can visit blackheroesmatter.org to support our campaign or for more information.

[Speaker 1] (15:18 - 15:23)
Thank you. Thank you. Our next speaker is Paul Colgan.

[Speaker 27] (15:25 - 18:26)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the Zoning Committee. I'm Paul Colgan with the Home Builders Association of Greater Chicago. We oppose ordinances 6206 for the 606 neighborhood and 6207 for the Pilsen neighborhood listed on the addendum to the agenda.

These ordinances really don't address affordable housing preservation issues and instead they limit private property rights of owners to choose a use that is less than the highest zoning allowed. Doesn't this turn a century of Chicago zoning law on its head? Our preference is to focus instead on incentives for owners to obtain and improve two, three or four flat buildings as naturally occurring affordable housing rather than prohibit new single family dwellings.

We prefer to make it economically attractive to keep them as multifamily buildings. That would encourage owners to invest in their properties or sell to new owners who would work to keep them as multifamily. One example of an incentive would be to include the entirety of both areas under the new ADU ordinances to allow for a lawful way to convert non-conforming or illegal apartments into safe and up to code apartments.

This would do more to protect the life, health and safety of any NOAA residents than any anti-demolition ordinance. Plus adding a coach house or conversion ADU unit would offer a far greater financial incentive to keep the property multifamily than selling for a single family. These are smart moves that don't violate private property rights and still preserve affordable housing.

Most of the owners of these properties are residents of these neighborhoods and have worked hard to buy and maintain their two, three or four flats. They may have their life savings tied up in these properties and now you wanna put a brick on their largest asset. You are taking away money they may want to use for their retirement, their families, their businesses.

We are concerned that these ordinances were added to the zoning agenda at the last minute without ever holding the community meeting to get feedback from the people who would be impacted the most. In fact, I'm told that some residents asked their alderman to host a meeting when the ordinance was first introduced, but they received an email from staff, not a phone call, mind you, an email saying they didn't have time for a meeting and that it wasn't their ordinance. So before you go down this path and limit the life savings of people in their neighborhood, I ask that you take time to meet with these owners, ask them what it would take to keep their properties as apartment.

Tell them about the property tax exemptions for improving their property. Help them utilize the AD ordinance to improve their properties and protect their investment. Give them more options, not less, to preserve their properties.

So I urge you to either hold or defeat these ordinances until there's an opportunity to talk with the owners of the impacted properties and find viable alternatives or incentives to preserving their properties as multifamily without violating their private property rights and limiting their life savings. Thank you for your consideration.

[Speaker 1] (18:27 - 18:35)
Thank you, Paul. Our next speaker, Brian Ubazuski. I hope I got that halfway right.

So Brian.

[Speaker 10] (18:42 - 18:46)
Brian, please press star six on your phone to unmute.

[Speaker 1] (18:56 - 19:06)
All right, Brian, you're still muted. It looks like. All right, we'll try to come back to you.

Our next speaker is Linda Gonzalez.

[Speaker 52] (19:12 - 20:29)
Hello, good morning. My name is Linda Gonzalez. I'm a 10th Ward community member speaking today to express disappointment that my older woman, Garza, is working with industry to weaken air quality in this area.

Chicagoans and environmental justice communities are exhausted from constantly shouldering the burdens created by air pollution and environmental racism. This is not about a variance for a single development, but it's about how the city is setting baseline rules for land use and the old way doesn't work. This is not just about wards with PMDs and M's.

This is a citywide issue. It's about the fact that other wards benefit from the burdens being placed in environmental justice communities. So all aldermen have an important role to play here and a duty to address disparities.

We are not in support of the air quality ordinance that was being proposed by Alderman Garza, who was working with industry on this. We demand for community-centered decision-making and that's all I have to say.

[Speaker 1] (20:29 - 20:38)
Thank you. Thank you, Linda. Our next speaker, Brianna Bertocchi.

Brianna.

[Speaker 26] (20:40 - 20:41)
Hi, can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (20:41 - 20:44)
Yes, we can. Please proceed. Hi, great.

[Speaker 26] (20:45 - 20:46)
Thank you.

[Speaker 31] (20:46 - 23:38)
Sure, okay. Hi, my name is Brianna. I'm a member of the 10th Ward.

All right, in a letter released to their colleagues last Friday, our 10th Ward Alderwoman Garza's office stated the original ordinance proposed by the mayor reached, quote, too far by taking decision-making capacity away from the community and local aldermen and giving it to the Zoning Board of Appeals. We would like to raise that, in fact, Garza is enacting this exact same accusation against her constituents by blocking our participation and input on the substitute ordinance that their offices have proposed. In fact, we were only made aware of this substitute ordinance after it was finalized last Friday.

To address some of the flags that were raised in the Alderwoman's revision, let us start in section 17-80511B, pertaining to large industrial development. We appreciate the mayor's ordinance containing language that would mandate PD review and approval for building storage areas and work areas on site. Getting in front of harm is the focus here, right?

In the event that these industries are encouraged simply to comply with standards, as is the language in the Alderwoman's revision, then are we not giving them the opportunity to fly under the radar as we have seen repeatedly in our city's history many times, even recently? Our community is asking for transparent review procedures that would allow us to hold companies accountable from the start. Assuming no formal review and approval procedures are followed, how much further harm and damage are we putting our communities through until audits are performed to ensure company compliance?

On this point, we recognize that Garza's revision cuts this corner, removing building storage areas and work areas on site from the requirement for PD review and approval, instead simply mandating that they, quote, be established pursuant to PD standards. On this point, the mayor's original ordinance has my support. Section 17-50200, pertaining to mining, is not clear in the Alderwoman's revision.

This is extraordinarily relevant for our ward in the present moment as we are looking at the potential for an Ozinga development to mimic Subtropolis in Missouri. You can Google that, it's called Subtropolis. The formal distinction between mining and excavation requires further scrutiny under both ordinances.

However, in this instance, the mayor's proposal also gets my vote as it clearly indicates that it will at least eliminate mining. To conclude, I am hesitantly in support of the mayor's initial proposal for this ordinance. I'm a member of the 10th Ward.

I feel the Alderman's revisions here do not hold her community's interest at heart. The zoning board submission appears to not only include more robust, I'm sorry, it does include more robust regulation and works to set standards to get ahead of harm. We would like to raise, however, that there is no motion in this ordinance to address or revise existing industrial sites.

With our ward having around 70 industrial sites currently, we are encouraged that these motions would protect communities from further harm. And also, we recognize that we still have longstanding issues with the corporations here presently. I'm in support of the original ordinance and also there is still much progress to be made at this time.

That's my check. Thank you. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (23:39 - 23:41)
Our next speaker, Kyra Woods.

[Speaker 26] (23:45 - 26:42)
Good morning. Thank you, Chairman. And good morning and happy new year again to all of the Aldermen on this particular committee.

My name is Kyra Woods and I am a campaign organizer with Sierra Club, Illinois Chapter. And this morning I am calling to express disappointment for the deferral of ordinance 2020-4590. We recognize in our city, incremental progress, it can be extremely difficult, but it is unfortunate that the desperate protections that our communities need are being held in a battle between these particular two proposed ordinances that don't really have all of the pieces completely there.

But we would really ask that all of the members of this committee consider the priorities and progress that needs to be made. Sierra Club stands in support of the Chicagoans in our environmental justice communities that continue to shoulder the burden of inaction and skewed priorities. As elected representatives of our community, we ask you to remember your commitment to community residents and not simply to corporate interests for the sake of economic development.

I had the privilege yesterday of moderating a conversation between Cheryl Johnson of People for Community Recovery and the Riverdale community and nationally renowned environmental justice leader, Dr. Robert Bullard. And Dr. Bullard reminded us that ultimately the cost of doing business cannot continue to be our community's health and frankly, our livelihoods. It is objective that this body and in coordination with other committees, of course, within city council craft solutions that ultimately serve our communities and keep us safe.

Well, the ordinance 45, excuse me, 2020-4590 is not intended to be complete, but it is a necessary first step. It is not about a single development, but really is calling this committee to modernize the baseline rules for our land use across our community. Leaving the rules as they are will continue to harm our working class communities and particularly our communities of color who are shouldering this impact and this burden, particularly as we do not make any progress or if we continue to be in a gridlock.

This is not simply an issue for wards with PMDs or with manufacturing designations, but this is about the collaboration across our city to ensure that no community continues to bear the burden of the progress and then the investments and economic opportunities. We are asking this committee to be committed to equitable development and ensuring that there are no sacrifice zones in our community of Chicago and our greater city, not just for the sake of racial equity, but economic progress and economic equity as well. And of course, the health of our community residents.

Thank you, and I yield my time.

[Speaker 1] (26:43 - 26:52)
Thank you. And I'm gonna go back to see if Brian Urbazuski is unmuted and ready to speak.

[Speaker 39] (26:55 - 26:56)
Hello, can people hear me now?

[Speaker 1] (26:56 - 26:57)
Yes. Is that Brian?

[Speaker 39] (26:58 - 29:21)
Thank you. Thank you. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My name is Brian Urbazuski. I represent Respiratory Health Association and I'm here to speak in support of the mayor's proposed Clean Air Ordinance 4590. We support this important step towards addressing racial disparities in health attributed in part to the location and impact of industry on Chicago communities, especially those on the South and the West side.

Last year, the city released its Healthy Chicago 2025 Public Health Agenda. It explicitly prioritizes communities disproportionately impacted by air pollution, and it aims to increase the buffers between where people live and where industry is located. Weeks before the Healthy Chicago 2025 was released, the Chicago Department of Public Health issued an air quality report that found communities on the South and West sides are the most vulnerable to the effects of air pollution.

It reiterated the city's commitment to advancing environmental justice and addressing pressing environmental challenges. Diesel engine exhaust is a significant local source of fine particulate matter, a pollutant tracked and regulated by the US EPA. It's responsible for asthma attacks, heart attacks, hospitalizations, and premature deaths.

The particles are small enough to reach the deepest portions of the lungs and can affect blood chemistry as well. Diesel exhaust also contains toxic air pollutants, chemical compounds linked to neurological damage, birth defects, cancer. Given the health threats that diesel engine exhaust poses to nearby residents, and the fact that warehousing, wholesaling, and freight movement facilities generating diesel truck traffic are increasing in vulnerable communities, such uses must be subject to public scrutiny and planned development review and not be given special treatment and zoning.

Communities on the South and the West sides facing industrial development should be provided with the time and the courtesy to review proposals and to participate in the processes that would bring dramatic changes, traffic, and pollution to their neighborhoods. Industries wanting to operate there should undergo a review of the potential additional health burdens and not be allowed to expedite polluting operations in already overburdened and vulnerable communities. The lungs and hearts of the most vulnerable communities are at risk and they deserve protection from polluters who continue to develop properties near their homes.

Thank you, and that's the end of my statement.

[Speaker 1] (29:21 - 29:54)
And that concludes the public commentary portion of the meeting. We're gonna start with the regular agenda and hear the map amendments first in an effort to minimize technical difficulties and to ensure the committee meeting runs as smoothly as possible. The typical order in which items will be heard has been updated throughout the duration of virtual committee on zoning meetings.

Items will be grouped together according to witness attorney and will be heard in that order rather than the ward order.

[Speaker 46] (29:56 - 29:57)
Chair?

[Speaker 1] (29:58 - 30:00)
Correct, Alderman Haddon.

[Speaker 46] (30:01 - 30:02)
Just wanted to be counted present.

[Speaker 1] (30:03 - 30:06)
Thank you. Anyone else joined?

[Speaker 10] (30:06 - 30:07)
Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 1] (30:07 - 30:50)
Alderman Burnett and Alderman Haddon add. Okay. So we will go on page one of the revised agenda.

That's item number 20492 T1 in the 27th ward. Ordinance was referred on September 9th of 2020. Common address is 1352 West Lake Street.

The change request, M23 Light Industry District to a DS-3 Downtown Service District. And we have Tim Barton or Tom Raines, which one is on there for that?

[Speaker 25] (30:53 - 30:55)
Good morning, Chairman Tunney. This is Tim Barton.

[Speaker 1] (30:56 - 30:59)
All right, Tim. Proceed on Lake Street, please.

[Speaker 25] (31:00 - 31:26)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My name is Timothy Barton. I'm an attorney with the law office of Thomas Raines.

I'm here representing Hog Salt Incorporated for the property at 1352 West Lake Street. This matter was reviewed at the November 19th plan commission. So I asked that that transcript be incorporated into the record of these proceedings.

[Speaker 1] (31:31 - 31:36)
Alderman Roboius moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

[Speaker 58] (31:37 - 31:38)
So moved.

[Speaker 1] (31:39 - 31:44)
Any objections? Hearing none, the records are incorporated. Continue, Tim.

[Speaker 25] (31:44 - 34:36)
Sure. As you said, the site is currently zoned M23. It's being proposed for a DS downtown service designation to establish a small Cheval carryout and dine-in hamburger restaurant.

This site is located in the Kinsey Industrial Corridor. Therefore, the change in the zoning from a manufacturing zoned designation to a non-industrial zone required review by the plan commission. On the previous slide, it shows the property improved with a one-story building and an open area.

It was formerly used as a dog training and kennel center. It's a 6,000 square foot lot. It includes a 2,085 square foot building and a 3,900 foot open area.

The building will be rehabbed and the open area will remain as an outdoor patio. And the next slide, you can see the site is a block east of Ogden Avenue. It's three blocks east of the Ashland L.

This is an area expanding rapidly with dense development. There are three planned developments in the immediate area, including one directly south of the site. Next slide, please.

Next slide, thanks. This will be Small Cheval's fourth location. It will have a pickup and dine-in service.

Hog Salt will modify their on-premise dining in compliance with COVID related guidelines. Two of their locations are currently open and the operator is very familiar with health policies and is keeping up to date on them. This area is still somewhat desolate in character in the immediate vicinity, but this new restaurant should be a significant help in enlivening the area.

This proposal has been reviewed by the West Loop Community Organization, as well as the neighbors of the West Loop. And they're both are supportive. The project has the support of Alderman Burnett.

With that, I respectfully ask for your positive recommendation. Thank you for your consideration.

[Speaker 1] (34:36 - 34:41)
Thank you, Tim. Alderman Burnett, would you like to speak on this restaurant?

[Speaker 10] (34:42 - 35:43)
Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. You know, Al Cheval is a very popular hamburger restaurant. They started one of their first ones over in the West Loop on Hawthorne Street.

Then they opened up another small Al Cheval right off of, I think, Canal and Washington. If I'm not mistaken, we're very excited to have these things coming further west. It's just an indication that things are starting to happen further west on the near west side.

So we're very excited to have this restaurant, bring these amenities to this community to help get more foot traffic in this area and help the other businesses in the area. So I support this 100%. All of our community organizations over there supported it.

Even the West Central Association, we have three organizations over here. So I ask for the committee support. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (35:43 - 35:55)
Thank you, Alderman. Any questions from committee members? Can I get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 40] (35:56 - 35:58)
Go ahead on motion, do pass.

[Speaker 1] (35:59 - 36:29)
That's Alderman Cardona, moves do pass as revised. All those in favor, any objections? Any objections?

Hearing none, the item is passed as revised. And I wanted to compliment the Alderman and the applicant. Obviously you saw the before and after picture.

So it's gonna be a substantial improvement to the area on Lake Street. So good luck and looks like plenty of post COVID outside dining, which was great. All right.

[Speaker 25] (36:30 - 36:31)
Thank you very much, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (36:31 - 37:06)
Thank you, Tim. All right, bottom of page one, document number 20478, 27th Ward. Ordinance was referred on September 9th of 2020.

Common address 1330 to 1364 West Washington, 100 through 138 North Ada and 1349 through 1389 West Randolph Street. This change request C13, neighborhood commercial district to a DX3 downtown mixed use district and then to a plan development. Our attorney is our former colleague, Chairman Banks.

[Speaker 47] (37:15 - 37:16)
Where are we at?

[Speaker 1] (37:25 - 37:43)
So Bill, you need to unmute. All right, one more time. Bill, Mr. Banks, you need to unmute.

[Speaker 8] (37:46 - 37:47)
Can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (37:48 - 37:52)
Thank you. You can proceed, Mr. Banks.

[Speaker 8] (37:54 - 37:55)
Can you hear me, Tim?

[Speaker 1] (37:55 - 37:57)
We can proceed.

[Speaker 8] (37:57 - 41:20)
Okay, very good. Once again, sorry for that. I'm a little old fashioned in my ways and obviously that's catching up to me.

At any rate, once again, William J.P. Banks, on behalf of 130, local 130, I am here with Jerry Shane, Tyler Manick, Leslie Magnavasco from Shane Banks. Here with Mike Fitzgerald, Travis Bridges, Gregory Jose and Melissa Toops, all from the architectural firm. Gregory, of course, is in house counsel for 130.

James Coyne is the business manager along with Ken Turnquist, the financial secretary treasurer for local 130. Also part of the team, Scott Goodman. And he is the managing partner at Fairpoint Contractor and Contractor, I should say.

We're here to talk about a very unique project, Mr. Chairman. And we have had a tremendous amount of outreach in the community, much like the last speaker and from the same ward in 27. We met with the West Community Association, neighbors of the West Loop, West Loop Central Organization.

There was a major meeting in the community and in all respects, not only was the community in favor of our project, but were unanimous in their wishes and goals. This is a very, very unusual situation in many ways. Because it's a seven-story parking facility, basically for the members of 130.

And it should be for them because they're paying for it completely, totally, and without any interference or help from the government agencies or TIFs or anything else. They have been longtime neighbors of this community, wonderful neighbors as a matter of fact. Been at the current address for about 100 years, believe it or not.

So they are true citizens of the city of Chicago. And when all the other agencies were running away from the West Loop, they dug in and have really maintained an outstanding relationship with the people and the community in general. So notwithstanding the outreach, which has been extraordinary, not one objector to my knowledge anyway.

And this matter was before the plan commission on December 17th. And at that time it passed unanimously. And so at this time, Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask a member of the committee to incorporate by reference all plan commission records and findings.

[Speaker 1] (41:21 - 41:45)
Alderman Ravois moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that motion? Hearing none, proceed Mr. Banks. And we've got a lot of, as you well know, we've got a lot of amendments today. So we keep it kind of short.

[Speaker 8] (41:46 - 41:49)
I'll be as brief as I can, Mr. Chairman, thank you.

[Speaker 1] (41:49 - 41:50)
Okay.

[Speaker 8] (41:50 - 44:33)
And just very brief description. This is a seven story structure, enough room for about 506 cars, 272,000 square feet of commercial space, 14,700 square feet on the first floor for additional restaurant use or what have you. The building itself is unbelievably well constructed.

It has, it's a covered structure. And of course, with any structure such as this, normally you don't have to cover it obviously, but in this case, the architects and developers decided that they wanted to talk about creating something different. So the roof that's on this building, and that's a good picture of it, is constructed as a harvester of rainwater.

So they basically, the plumbers will basically be able to maintain their facility independently of city water to a very large extent. There is also a terrace section just above the restaurant section. And the first two floors are for use by the plumbers.

And the really important issue here, and what I think is most important to the people of the community, because it's a parking desert for all intents and purposes, this will give the community people the ability to use these facilities, everything above the first two floors, for their use and for the community's use. The green space is extraordinary. It is one of the other positive points.

As a matter of fact, you can't really find any negatives with this project. City of Chicago itself benefits tremendously. As you know, there's a car tax, a parking tax, other taxes, such as retail sales tax, things like this that'll be in play.

And in fact, about $130,000 a year will go back to the city of Chicago, and that's without property taxes, et cetera. And that being the case- And there's two- Pardon? I'm sorry.

[Speaker 1] (44:36 - 44:36)
Continue.

[Speaker 8] (44:40 - 45:07)
For the most part, Mr. Chairman, we've had a tremendous amount of input back and forth with the City Alderman. Alderman Burnett has been outstanding in putting together the meetings, et cetera, helping us do that anyway. The benefits are unbelievable.

Once again, the tag, the property...

[Speaker 1] (45:08 - 45:15)
I'm trying to be as quick as I can, but I'm getting- Well, we're gonna hear from Alderman Burnett on the community process, I'm sure, so.

[Speaker 8] (45:15 - 45:43)
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I just wanted to make it clear that this was a matter that was paid for by the plumbers themselves. It's a $25 million project, and they are really giving back to this community. Mr. Chairman, if I may ask, at this particular time, that you recognize the Alderman for his comment?

[Speaker 1] (45:44 - 45:45)
I will, thank you. Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 10] (45:50 - 47:12)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. As the councilor said, they met with all the community organizations. Everyone's excited about this.

This is another example of something coming west. This is not too far from the Oxford Ball proposal that was just presented. So things are coming west and getting ready to go over Ogden in this area.

We appreciated that the plumbers are staying in the community and figuring out a way to stay in the community and be prosperous. So we thank them and their members for their commitment to our neighborhood. We also appreciate the fact that they're putting a parking lot up.

No one in this city is building freestanding parking lots anymore. So we appreciate that. That's gonna benefit the community.

It's gonna benefit all of the businesses that's moving to this area and all of the offices. So we're excited about this. I thank the Department of Planning.

The Department of Planning been very diligent in pushing the envelope, trying to make sure that this is a nice parking lot in our community. And I look forward to the other things that the Plumbers Union are gonna do with their property in the future. So I ask for the committee's support on this.

I support it, my community support it, and thank you.

[Speaker 1] (47:12 - 47:19)
Thank you, Alderman. I see Alderman Ray Lopez's hand is up. Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 6] (47:22 - 47:45)
Thank you, Chairman and good morning members of the committee. I just wanna commend our colleague Alderman Burnett. I did have a question.

You said that the roof is going to be like a collector for rainwater. Where's it stored at? And how will it be purified for, is it just for landscaping use?

Is it for interior use? Just very interested in how you're working it.

[Speaker 1] (47:46 - 47:46)
All right.

[Speaker 8] (47:47 - 47:48)
I'm sorry, go ahead.

[Speaker 1] (47:49 - 47:55)
No, Mr. Banks, answer the question please about the harvesting.

[Speaker 8] (47:56 - 48:29)
Well, it's basically a design system in some of the newer buildings. And as far as all of the technicalities involved, it's really for use not only just as a watering agent, it's also to use and process water at the site. So it is a very, very expansive system type of design, designed to be used for the whole project.

[Speaker 1] (48:32 - 48:37)
You said, Raymond, did I hear where it's gonna be stored was the question? Part of it, yes.

[Speaker 8] (48:39 - 48:43)
I'm not familiar with the storage portion.

[Speaker 1] (48:43 - 48:50)
Well, I know you've got plenty of people on your team and I think I know the answer, but I would rather hear it from the plumber's perspective.

[Speaker 6] (48:53 - 48:58)
I'm sure the plumber knows where to put water. He's very curious as to where they put it.

[Speaker 40] (48:58 - 48:59)
They do that.

[Speaker 10] (48:59 - 49:02)
So from what I understand, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 12] (49:02 - 49:03)
Yeah, Solomon Burnett.

[Speaker 10] (49:03 - 49:14)
The plumbers are gonna reuse the rainwater. Yeah. So like when you flush the toilet and all of those things, they reuse their water in their facilities.

[Speaker 1] (49:15 - 49:15)
Absolutely.

[Speaker 8] (49:17 - 49:21)
And where it's stored, I am not 100% sure.

[Speaker 6] (49:22 - 49:49)
Okey-doke. The reason I bring it up and I don't wanna get into too flavor of the point. I just think it's a great model perhaps to look at for other buildings moving forward, particularly as we see water becoming more and more a scarce commodity with water futures being a highly traded commodity now.

Making our buildings giant collectors in the city definitely should be something that we look at and possibly incorporate into the building code. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (49:49 - 49:50)
Alderman Hopkins.

[Speaker 14] (49:52 - 50:36)
Oh yeah. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I just wanna offer my support for this project and congratulate Alderman Burnett on successfully leading the community review process to fruition.

Seems to be an outstanding program. Congratulations to the plumbers and to Farpoint Development. I can personally attest to the lack of parking in that area.

He's a veteran of many hockey games at Johnny's Ice House. Times I almost missed the opening face-off cause I was circling the block. So clearly there's a need for this.

My only question is regarding the retail space, are there any letters of intent or any potential retail tenants on the horizon that would be considered an ideal use for the retail space?

[Speaker 8] (50:36 - 51:09)
We do have, we haven't made a decision on that yet as to which one we would pick, but yes, we do have offers and, but we're still in the talking stages of this one. And in addition, if I can go back to that question with all the modern devices we now have, I was able to ascertain through the grapevine that the water, by the way, Alderman Lopez is stored underground.

[Speaker 47] (51:13 - 51:13)
Okay.

[Speaker 8] (51:13 - 51:13)
Does that help?

[Speaker 1] (51:14 - 51:44)
Yep. And I, Chairman Banks, I knew that because I did take a, I had an opportunity to visit the hall itself and they use that same kind of technology in their building. So it's exciting to see this water preservation efforts and kudos to the team and to the Plumber's Union.

I don't see any other hands up. Can I get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 36] (51:45 - 51:46)
I move.

[Speaker 1] (51:46 - 52:00)
Alderman Raymond Lopez moves do pass any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed as revised, I believe. Okay.

All right. Thank you. Thank you to the team.

And thank you to all at the Plumber's Union.

[Speaker 8] (52:00 - 52:01)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (52:02 - 52:44)
All right. Now we're on the top of page two, document number 20494 T1 in the 47th ward. Ordinance was referred on September 9th of 2020.

Common address 1800 through 1808 West Bernice. Bernice Avenue and 3834 through 3844 North Ravenswood Avenue. The change request is a B2.15 neighborhood mixed use district and M12 limited manufacturing business park district will be two three neighborhood mixed use district. And we have Katrina McGuire. Good morning, Katrina.

[Speaker 9] (52:44 - 53:58)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. Again, Katrina McGuire from Thompson Coburn. Here on behalf of the applicant with me today are Patrick Landrosch representing the applicant as well as Chris Michalak of Sullivan Goulet who's the project architect.

Briefly, this is a matter that we engaged heavily with Alderman Martin and his staff on. We're grateful for their time. We also met with the community organizations as well as with our immediate neighbors.

As a result of those meetings and discussions, the project has evolved and we are currently proposing a six story transit oriented mixed use building with approximately 3000 square feet of commercial space on the ground floor and about 9,900 square feet of commercial space on the second floor contemplated as office space. The proposed building will have 40 dwelling units, four efficiency units that are located in the third through the sixth floors and 25 parking spaces, 40 bicycle parking spaces. This project will provide 20% affordable all on site.

We do have a letter of support from Alderman Martin, but it is my understanding that he might be with us this morning as well. And with that, we would be certainly available for any questions.

[Speaker 1] (54:00 - 55:04)
Thank you, Katrina. I know we have a letter of support from Alderman Martin. I don't think he's on the call this morning.

Do we have to accept the substitute? No. Okay, I'm sorry.

So Alderman Roboius moves to accept the substantive narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that? All right.

Hearing none, the substantive narrative and plans are accepted. And now if there's any other questions, questions from committee members. All right, hearing no questions, can I get a motion to move to pass?

Move, Mr. Chairman, Alderman Austin. Alderman Austin moves to pass on the substantive narrative plans. All those in favor, aye.

Any objections to that? All right. Hearing no objections, this motion's passed with a substantive narrative and plans.

Thank you, Katrina.

[Speaker 9] (55:04 - 55:05)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (55:06 - 55:51)
All right, middle of page two, document number 20479, 27th Ward. Ordinance was referred on September 9th of 2020. This address, 1465 through 1483 North Kingsbury Street, 835 through 919 West Blackhawk Street, and 1450 through 1472 North Dayton Street.

The change request, business plan development number 1292, which has underlying C35 commercial manufacturing and employment district, to a C25 motor vehicle related commercial district to a residential plan development 1292 as amended.

[Speaker 9] (55:52 - 56:21)
Sounds like a lot, Katrina. Why don't you explain it to the committee members? It is.

Thank you again, Mr. Chairman. Again, for the record, Katrina McGuire from Thompson Coburn here on behalf of the applicant with me this morning should be Mike Drew from structured development, as well as Ryan Mondrail of Grek Architects. This is a matter that was heard by the plan commission at their December 17th hearing, and we do enjoy unanimous support by the plan commission.

We would ask that the records of the proceedings before the plan commission be incorporated herein.

[Speaker 1] (56:22 - 56:33)
So Alderman Cardona moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that? Hearing none, the records are incorporated.

[Speaker 9] (56:34 - 1:01:25)
Continue Katrina. Thank you. And I know in the interest of time, you have a busy agenda, but I'd like to make a brief presentation on this project.

This is a matter that's in the heart of the Halstead Triangle bound by Kingsbury, Blackhawk and Dayton and is the first project to be approved after the amendment to the Halstead Triangle plan, which occurred back in August of 2020. Next slide, please. So project that's going to be, that will be developed in five sub areas.

As you can see here on the right side of the screen is sub area D, which is currently under construction. Sub area A, B and C are contemplated as new construction buildings, which will be flanking a publicly accessible, but privately owned park. Next slide, please.

Sub area A is a 327 unit rental building with ground floor commercial uses. Next slide, please. Sub area B is contemplated as a 34 unit, all affordable condominium building directly adjacent to the park.

Next slide, please. And building C is 126 unit rental building on the other side of the park. Next slide, please.

And this is just a rendering of the sports and entertainment, sports and recreation facility that is currently under construction in sub area D. It is contemplated as a rock climbing facility. Next slide, please.

Here's just a highlight of the park. It's an element of the project that we're very proud of. It's a half acre park that involves a dog park, community garden, a play area and a variety of landscape and hardscape features.

This is a park that's going to be subject to a public access easement agreement, as well as a development and maintenance agreement with the city of Chicago. Again, as I mentioned, it will be publicly accessible and privately funded and maintained. Next slide.

Here's just a view from the Northwest showing both in the forefront of building A, the condo building, the low rise at building B and then in the background building C. Next slide, please. And this is sort of from the back of the project.

This highlights the park. And as you can see the open, the amenity spaces for the three buildings to be constructed all face the park as well. Next slide.

One of the key elements of the Halsted triangle plan update was to enhance the pedestrian experience and the project team worked very closely with the department of planning and development, as well as CDOT to eliminate driveways, as well as to enhance the pedestrian experience through building design as well. Next slide, please. This is just another view focused on the condominium building.

And as you can see there between building C and A, the access to the park, this is viewed from Black Hawk. Next slide, please. Between buildings A and B, a paseo is being created, which provides some opportunities for open space and overflow space within the retail within building A, as well as an additional access point for pedestrians to the park, which you can see in the rear.

Next slide. This is a project that provided a unique opportunity for the developer to provide for sale family-sized affordable units. We engaged very heavily and closely with the department of housing in the programming of this, and we're certainly grateful for their time.

Half of the affordable units will be provided onsite within the development in the 34 unit all affordable condominium building in sub area B, which is the picture at the bottom of your screen, which consists primarily of three and four bedroom units. The developer has also agreed to pay for professional property management for a year after turnover. We'll fund a year's worth of reserves, as well as the first three months of condominium assessments for each homeowner.

And then an additional 33 units will be provided offsite, still within the 27th ward, within a for sale townhome community located at Harris and Francisco. The townhomes are three bedroom, two and a half bath homes. All of the units will be included in the Chicago community land trust portfolio.

Next slide, please. And just finally, and briefly, some of the economic and community benefits that will result from this development. As I mentioned before, the half acre privately owned publicly accessible park, a developer funded traffic signal at Blackhawk and Halstead, resurfacing of Perimeter Street, $3 million in real estate tax proceeds with approximately 1000 construction jobs with a commitment by the developer to fulfill the city's MBWV goals.

And with that, our project, I mean, our presentation is done. I understand Alderman Burnett is present and we're certainly available for questions.

[Speaker 1] (1:01:26 - 1:01:33)
All right, Alderman Burnett, go ahead. This is a large but handsome project.

[Speaker 10] (1:01:34 - 1:03:23)
Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman. First of all, I wanna commend the Department of Planning and Development. As you know, we changed this area to allow for residential to go on this and we went through a procedure with the community in order to make that happen.

I wanna thank the residents over in that area, although the residents in that area, immediate area, are Alderman Hopkins residents, but they approved this project. The developer is doing 20% affordable. He's doing 10% on site.

As you can see, he's doing an affordable building and he's gonna do 10% offsite over on around Francisco and Harrison Street. He's building townhome development on the west side where we haven't had development in over 50 years to happen. And he also took the liberty to mentor guys from that community and allow them to build one of the houses, one of the townhomes themselves.

So I really appreciate this development. I appreciate the New North Unity Program. We had a meeting with this developer and the community.

Everyone was very impressed and excited about it. This is close to the Wild Mile. It's gonna enhance the Wild Mile, the green space that's happening on the river there.

This is gonna benefit the community a lot, bring a lot of jobs, bring housing. This is a win-win for the city. It's a win-win for this community, win-win for affordable housing.

So we support this 100% and so does our community. And we ask for the committee support also.

[Speaker 1] (1:03:23 - 1:03:27)
Thank you, Alderman. I see Alderman Kerry Austin's hand is up. Kerry.

[Speaker 52] (1:03:30 - 1:03:40)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would just like to ask the presenter, what's the price range of the affordable?

[Speaker 9] (1:03:44 - 1:03:55)
I don't know, Mike, if you wanna answer specific price points, but the affordable condominiums will be priced at 100% of AMI and eligible for purchasers up to 120% of AMI.

[Speaker 40] (1:03:56 - 1:04:46)
So Alderman Austin, this is Mike Drew. I'm the developer for Structured Development. The on-site condominiums are, again, family size, three and four bedroom condominiums, and they'll be priced at a maximum of $330,000 to $360,000, which is about a half to a fraction of what market rate is in the area around this development.

The 33 family size, three bedroom townhomes at Harrison and Francisco are being sold in the first phase for $229,000 per unit. And we've completed the first phase. There are seven units that are currently for sale and are going through the CCLT process for qualified buyers.

[Speaker 47] (1:04:47 - 1:04:47)
Okay.

[Speaker 3] (1:04:48 - 1:05:03)
Thank you. Well, I grew up right down the street, 1520 North Mohawk. So I was like, okay, it has changed tremendously, but I'd have to say it's absolutely beautiful.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (1:05:05 - 1:05:07)
Alderman Villegas, did you have your hand up? Gil?

[Speaker 53] (1:05:11 - 1:05:12)
Chairman, I put it down, thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:05:12 - 1:05:19)
Okay. All right, any other questions from committee members? If I- Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 14] (1:05:20 - 1:06:20)
That is Alderman Hopkins. Yeah, I just wanted to, once again, thank Alderman Burnett for his cooperation. He's entirely right.

He and I share some common borders where the issue might be in one ward, but the residents happen to be across the ward boundary in the other. And he and I have developed a rapport over the years. We know how to handle that.

And we know how to work cooperatively with the residents, as was the case in this project. I'm aware of no opposition, and that wasn't always the case. There were a number of different ideas that have been floated for this particular parcel over the years.

This is by far the best, and the residents know it. So we're very pleased to be moving forward with this. I wanna commend the development team.

And once again, thank Alderman Burnett for working cooperatively with the second ward residents in this area to get to a win-win. This is a good project and I'm pleased to support it. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:06:21 - 1:06:51)
Thank you, Alderman. I don't see other hands up. So can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

So moved. So moved, Cardona. The last one I can hear is Cardona.

So Alderman Cardona moves do pass. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed as revised.

All right, Katrina, I think we're done with you for the day. For now, okay. All right.

[Speaker 14] (1:06:51 - 1:06:52)
I hope so, she already left.

[Speaker 1] (1:06:53 - 1:07:19)
All right, bottom of page two, document number 20565T1, first ward. Ordinance was referred on December 16th of 2020. Common address, 650 Northwood Street.

And the change request, RS3 residential single unit detached house to an RM5.5 residential multi-unit district. Sarah Barnes. Sarah.

[Speaker 11] (1:07:19 - 1:10:21)
Thank you. Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Sarah Barnes and I'm an attorney with the Law Offices of Sam Banks located at 221 Northwest Sale Street.

Happy to be here this morning on behalf of the applicant. The applicant is the owner of the loan commercial unit which is located within the first floor of the existing eight unit mixed use condominium building, which aside from the applicant's unit currently contains a total of eight dwelling units. Despite many years of diligent and exhaustive efforts to secure a long-term and compatible tenant for the commercial unit, such incredible efforts have remained completely fruitless causing significant irreconcilable loss to the applicant above and beyond just the mental frustration.

As such, the applicant is seeking the subject zoning map amendment, which will allow for the conversion of this single commercial unit into a single dwelling unit, which will be added to the existing homeowners association. No physical expansion of the existing building is necessary or intended. All of the work for the conversion will be confined solely within the building.

Towards this end and as a matter of relevant background, in particular, in light of the recent passage of the additional dwelling unit ordinance, the applicant began this process over three years ago. Under the previous administration, the applicant spent the last or at least 18 months meeting with the Chicago Grand and Neighbors Association toward the effectuation of this proposal. And ensuring a robust community review.

As well and along the way, the applicant suffered a tragic family loss, which rightfully so left this matter tabled for many, many months. We recently finally filed the application, the subject application for the zoning change. And the reason that we did not file or avail ourselves to the ADU ordinance is because the physicality of the existing building already exceeds the FAR, the underlying FAR in the RS3 zoning district.

And as a result, we don't qualify or meet the requirements for the ADU ordinance and had to proceed with the zoning change. Towards these ends, in addition to the support of the Chicago Grand Neighbors Association, we also have met with Alderman LaSpada and do have an acknowledgement of his non-opposition. With all of that, we very respectfully request the support and approval of this honorable committee.

And I'm happy to answer any questions you may have.

[Speaker 1] (1:10:21 - 1:10:41)
I think that was LaSpada. All right, we do have a letter from Alderman LaSpada in support of this. Is he on?

Okay, so I think he's just joined the call. Daniel, you want to speak on the Northwood application, please?

[Speaker 19] (1:10:42 - 1:11:21)
Chairman, yes, it is a really great proposal. We really appreciate how comprehensive the community process has been. And it really is in line with the overall, not only the zoning, but the feel of what, I've walked the street.

If anything, a commercial space at this particular intersection on the street there did not really make sense for the surrounding area. So in this case, converting it to residential makes the most sense for the community. And we also really appreciate the review work done by the Chicago Grand Neighborhood Association.

[Speaker 1] (1:11:22 - 1:11:27)
To Alderman, quick question. What's the number of parking spaces on this thing?

[Speaker 11] (1:11:29 - 1:11:49)
That's a good question. I believe we are at, one second, Chairman, sorry. It's four and it will remain four.

They're in a garage. It's a detached garage. Okay, I get the number.

[Speaker 1] (1:11:51 - 1:11:53)
Daniel, that was brought up in the community, right? So they're fine with four.

[Speaker 19] (1:11:55 - 1:12:04)
That's my understanding as well. I mean, arguably, if you were using this space as a commercial space, you would need more parking rather than less.

[Speaker 1] (1:12:04 - 1:12:08)
So I think it makes a lot of sense. Great, all right, questions from committee members?

[Speaker 47] (1:12:09 - 1:12:11)
Move to pass, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:12:11 - 1:12:47)
Hearing no questions, Alderman Dowell moves to pass. Any objections to her motion? Hearing none, the item's passed.

Thank you. And now we're staying with Sarah. We're on the top of page three.

Document number 20571, 31st Ward. Ordinance was referred on December 16th of 2020. Address, 4921 West Belmont Avenue.

And the change request, B11, Neighborhood Shopping District to a C21 Motor Vehicle Related District. Sarah?

[Speaker 11] (1:12:47 - 1:15:37)
Thank you once more, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. Once again, for the record, my name is Sarah Barnes and I'm an attorney at the Lofts of CM Banks located at 221 Northwest South Street. Happy to be here once again on behalf of the Applicant Auto Renew Group.

For the last 17 plus years, the applicant has been successfully operating a detailing and reconditioning automobile repair shop in Addison, Illinois. Due to changes in development patterns in Addison, the applicant is being forced to relocate its operations. As serendipity would have it, such relocation will bring him to Chicago, more specifically and very happily to the 31st Ward.

Which brings us to the subject property on Belmont Avenue, which such property is already improved with a one-story industrial building that has been operating as a similar automobile service shop for many years. Those operations are non-conforming under the current B zoning classification. Towards these ends, the current operator at that subject site recently decided to close its doors.

The applicant therefore is seeking to keep the site activated by relocating its operations into the existing building. In doing so, and because a completely new license is required for the applicant as a new operator, the applicant is required to bring the underlying zoning for the property into compliance with the ongoing vehicular operations, which such operations include some light painting. Hence the subject zoning map amendment, which is intended to and is necessary to do just that, to bring the use into compliance with the current zoning ordinance.

As part of this process, we first reached out to and met with Alderman Cardona to discuss the operations and the administrative challenges that the applicant has encountered in seeking a license for the property. Alderman Cardona has been instrumental and actively engaged in our ongoing efforts towards these ends. Along these same lines and as part of the proposal, the applicant intends to work in conjunction with the Alderman's office toward hiring employees from within the ward, in addition to the several existing employees and customers who actually already reside in the neighborhood.

The applicant is extremely excited to make the 31st ward, it's new home in which to continue to contribute and grow. And with that, I also want to extend my personal gratitude to Alderman Cardona and his efforts towards helping us out with this zoning change. I believe that Alderman Cardona is in session right now with us.

[Speaker 1] (1:15:38 - 1:15:41)
So he may- So we're ready to hear from him if you're finished with your report.

[Speaker 40] (1:15:42 - 1:16:17)
All right. Alderman Cardona. Thank you, Chairman and members of the committee.

This is great. Small businesses trying to keep them open, especially under the pandemic and also for the neighborhood. Met with the owner when he was interested in buying the piece of property.

We had several talks and especially employing people from the community is one of the best things we could do for our community itself. So I look for your favorable support from the committee and yourself for the zoning change. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:16:18 - 1:16:48)
Alderman or the applicant? Hearing no questions, can I get a motion moved to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? So moved, Mr. Chairman. Alderman Austin. The Alderman Austin moves to pass. Any objections?

Hearing none, the item is passed. And congratulations, Alderman. And Sarah, I think that's your last.

What's with the Cubs World Series backdrop there? Was that trying to get on my good side or what?

[Speaker 11] (1:16:49 - 1:16:58)
I'm still trying to live the dream because I don't know when that dream's ever gonna happen again and I'm dealing with the Bears debacle. So I don't have much going for me right now.

[Speaker 1] (1:16:58 - 1:17:03)
Well, you know, we're a divided ward. We have some White Sox fans here in the 45.

[Speaker 11] (1:17:04 - 1:17:29)
We'll see one of those for the White Sox next year, I think. Alrighty, okay. Towards that Alderman or Chairman, excuse me, my office still has a couple items later on in the agenda.

I believe Daniel's gonna be handling those, but he might be logging in under my Zoom. So you can just keep me active if you want. I'll mute myself and stop the video for now though.

Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:17:29 - 1:17:55)
Thanks everyone. Thank you, Sarah. Middle of page three, document number 20578, Eighth Ward, ordinance was referred on December 16th of 2020.

Common address, 1503 East, 74th Place. And the change request, RS3, residential single unit detached house to an RT4, residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district. And we have Mark Kupiak.

[Speaker 35] (1:17:55 - 1:18:50)
Mark? Alderman, Mark here. For some reason, I don't have a video button.

Oh, there's a video. Thank you. My name is Mark Kupiak.

I'm an attorney with offices 77 West Washington. I represent the applicant on this particular matter. I'm 74th Place.

We've got a property that's improved with an existing old original two flat building. The building's vacant in need of repairs, actually recently suffered some fire damage. The applicant plans to remodel the building and zoning change would allow him to establish a basement apartment.

The rent from that basement apartment would help with the expenses of the rehab and also provide an additional dwelling unit. We've worked with the Alderman's office to explain the project and the situation, asked for her support. And I believe a letter from the Alderman has been sent.

Hopefully you have it.

[Speaker 1] (1:18:51 - 1:18:55)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Michelle Harris.

[Speaker 35] (1:18:57 - 1:18:58)
And with that, I'd ask for your support.

[Speaker 1] (1:18:59 - 1:19:06)
Thank you, sir. Questions from committee members? Can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was?

[Speaker 4] (1:19:07 - 1:19:08)
Move to pass. Rodriguez.

[Speaker 1] (1:19:10 - 1:19:29)
That was Alderman Rodriguez. Move to pass. Any objections to that motion?

Hearing none, the item is passed. All right. Mark, we're on the bottom of page three.

My understanding that we're gonna, this item needs to be deferred.

[Speaker 35] (1:19:29 - 1:19:31)
Yes, we'd like to defer that, please.

[Speaker 1] (1:19:31 - 1:19:33)
Is that based on, you're making that request?

[Speaker 35] (1:19:34 - 1:19:35)
Yes. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:19:35 - 1:20:09)
So let me read it into the record. Document number 20582T1, 27th Ward. Ordinance was referred on December 16th of 2020.

Address, 615 North Ogden. Change request. M12 limited manufacturing business park district to a B25 neighborhood mixed use district.

And at the request of the attorney, the item needs to be deferred. Can I get a motion to defer the item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Cardona.

[Speaker 44] (1:20:10 - 1:20:10)
Move to pass.

[Speaker 1] (1:20:10 - 1:20:49)
Alderman Cardona moves to defer the item. Any objections? Hearing none, the item's deferred.

All right. Top of page four. We're moving on item number 20547T1, 22nd Ward.

Ordinance was referred on November 16th of 2020. The common address, 3925 West 31st Street. And the change request.

B31 community shopping district to a B35 community shopping district. I think we have some changes on this one. Let's start.

Mark.

[Speaker 35] (1:20:49 - 1:21:37)
Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My name is Mark Kupiec. I'm an attorney with offices at 77 West Washington.

Represent the applicant. And yes, procedurally, we do have a substitute ordinance, which has been a copy of which sent to the zoning department and your committee. After filing, the alderman asked us to take a closer look at this.

And upon further research, we've determined that the project can be done in a B3-2 district. So the substitute ordinance would rezone it to a B3-2. And along with that, the B3-2 would not require a type one application.

So we would like to revise our application, withdraw our plans and narrative and proceed with the B3-2 as a regular type two application.

[Speaker 3] (1:21:38 - 1:21:39)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:21:39 - 1:22:05)
So we are going to ask for the substitute to be accepted and for the benefit of the committee members, we're changing the zoning from the B31 to B32 versus what was originally a B35. And then this is no longer a T1. It'll be done under the straight zoning of B32.

Is that correct?

[Speaker 47] (1:22:06 - 1:22:06)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (1:22:07 - 1:22:09)
Okay. Can I get a motion to accept that substitute?

[Speaker 47] (1:22:10 - 1:22:11)
So moved, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:22:12 - 1:22:30)
Alderman Dow moves on that substitute. Any objections to her motion? Hearing none, the substitute is before us and accepted.

All right. Now we want to hear from... Mark, are you finished?

[Speaker 35] (1:22:31 - 1:23:25)
I'll just briefly describe it. Properties currently improved with the building. The building housed a former meat market.

The applicant plans to build a partial, partial second floor addition to add some floor area. This would allow a local doctor to move his existing office, which is located down the street into this building, which would give him more space where he'd be better able to serve his patients. Many of the patients are from the local area.

At the Alderman's request, we did two virtual community meetings, one during the day, one in the evening. We did have a Spanish interpreter available for those meetings. And the Alderman was also present at both meetings to explain the project and answer the questions of the neighbors who called in.

And with that, I believe we have the Alderman here. We followed up with him to ask him for his support.

[Speaker 2] (1:23:26 - 1:23:26)
Good.

[Speaker 1] (1:23:26 - 1:23:28)
Well, Alderman Rodriguez is on the call.

[Speaker 2] (1:23:28 - 1:24:06)
Mike, you want to talk about this one? Thank you, Mr. Chair and members of the committee. Yeah, I'm happy to be in support of this effort.

I think the applicant who we know well in the community, over 30 years of work in the community, and their proposal will redo unsightly corner building in the heart of our community. And we'll add a pharmacy, not just to the clients of the doctor, but also to the community residents and additional parking spaces. So there were no objections in our community meetings and I support this project wholeheartedly.

[Speaker 1] (1:24:07 - 1:24:07)
Thank you.

[Speaker 2] (1:24:07 - 1:24:09)
Questions for the Alderman?

[Speaker 1] (1:24:10 - 1:24:21)
Just quickly, Mike, what is the parking? Since that was part of the larger upzoning was the parking requirements. So how many parking spaces will be available for the project?

[Speaker 2] (1:24:22 - 1:24:23)
I believe they're adding five spaces.

[Speaker 1] (1:24:24 - 1:24:46)
All right. Okay. Any questions, comments?

All right. Can I get a motion to move to pass on this item that was substituted by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Cardona to pass.

Cardona moves the substitute. All those in favor?

[Speaker 40] (1:24:48 - 1:24:48)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (1:24:49 - 1:24:57)
Any opposed to it? All right. So this item is being passed as substituted.

I think that's it for that one.

[Speaker 15] (1:24:58 - 1:24:58)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:25:04 - 1:25:33)
Middle of page four. Document number 20584T1, 12th Ward. Ordinance was referred on December 16th of 2020.

Common address, 2401 South Holman Avenue and 3349 through 3359 West 24th Street. The change request. RT4 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district to an RM 5.5 residential multi-unit district.

[Speaker 17] (1:25:34 - 1:26:42)
We have Rolando Acosta. Rolando. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant for this matter. The subject property contains approximately 3,600 square feet of land. It's improved with a tall two-story building that is located at the corner of 24th Street and Holman.

The building is in rather deteriorated shape. The applicant proposes to rehabilitate the building, add four units to the building by making use of the existing basement, which is a full height basement, as well as the attic, which is significantly tall. And for that purpose, it seeks the rezoning of the property to RM 5.5. One parking space will be added to the property. The building occupies almost the entire site. So that is all that we have room for. We'll visit the Zoning Board of Appeals to seek a variance with respect to the other parking spaces.

With that, Mr. Chairman, I believe the Alderman, Alderman Cardenas has submitted a letter of support to your committee. And I would stand for any questions you may have.

[Speaker 6] (1:26:43 - 1:26:43)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (1:26:43 - 1:26:59)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Cardenas. Any questions from committee members? Hearing none, we've got a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

[Speaker 5] (1:27:00 - 1:27:01)
So moved, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:27:02 - 1:27:44)
That's Alderman Beall. Moves do pass. Any objections to the motion?

Hearing none, the item's passed. Thank you. Rolando, we're gonna stay with you.

On the bottom of page four, document number 20577-T1, 12th Ward. Ordinance was referred on December 16th of 2020. Common address, 3300 West Pershing Road, 3846 through 3858 South Spalding Avenue.

This change request, RS 3, residential single unit detached house district to an RM 6, residential multi-unit district. Rolando.

[Speaker 17] (1:27:44 - 1:28:28)
Again, Mr. Chairman, Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant. This is very similar to the prior matter. This is another corner building that has a full basement and full attic and was significantly deteriorated.

The applicant proposes to rehabilitate the building and add three units to the property. This building is actually built to its property line, and so it will not be able to... No additional parking will be able to be added, but this is, I believe, a very welcome change in this neighborhood as this building has stood in what is a dilapidated state for probably over a decade at this point.

Again, Alderman Cardenas has submitted a letter of support, and I would be happy to answer any questions the committee may have.

[Speaker 1] (1:28:28 - 1:28:41)
Thank you, Rolando. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Cardenas. Questions by committee members?

Can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 4] (1:28:44 - 1:28:46)
Moved to pass, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:28:46 - 1:29:34)
Alderman Wagesback. Alderman Wagesback moves to pass. Any objections to his motion?

Hearing none, the item is passed. All right, now we're on the top of page five, application number 20554-T1, 12th Ward. Ordinance was referred on November 16th of 2020.

This common address, 3723 to 3753 South Archer Avenue, also 3728 to 3904 South Western Avenue, and the change request, M22 Light Industry District to a C11 Neighborhood Commercial District. Rolando.

[Speaker 17] (1:29:35 - 1:30:55)
Again, Mr. Chairman, Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant. This is an approximately 61,000 square foot parcel that sits at the corner of Western and Archer. It currently contains a vacant former Walgreens store that's been vacant for about five years.

The applicant proposes to demolish the existing store and redevelop the property with two buildings, a northern building that will contain a 711 convenience store with gas pumps. I believe some of you may have seen these now throughout the city. And then on the southern portion of the property, a Starbucks with a drive-through.

The gasoline function, as well as the drive-through function for Starbucks will require special uses that we would pursue should we be approved today. The property's currently, notwithstanding the fact that it was used for a Walgreens for many years, it's zoned M22, rather heavy manufacturing. It's across from McKinley Park.

We seek to rezone it to C11 for the proposed use. We had a community, a virtual community meeting that was well attended, approximately 30 people. And we had a subsequent meeting with the McKinley Park Advisory Council.

Both meetings yielded support for the project. And I believe the alderman has also submitted a letter of support for this matter.

[Speaker 1] (1:30:56 - 1:31:04)
We do again have a letter of support from Alderman Cardenas. We have a question from Alderman Ray Lopez, I see. Raymond.

[Speaker 6] (1:31:05 - 1:31:07)
Thank you, Chairman. Good morning, Rolando.

[Speaker 17] (1:31:08 - 1:31:08)
Good morning, sir.

[Speaker 6] (1:31:09 - 1:31:23)
Will there be the entrances and exits for the two businesses? I know that's a very busy intersection, especially with the bus stop there. Are they gonna be using only the two entrances that exist currently, or will they be adding to that?

[Speaker 17] (1:31:24 - 1:31:51)
So we are using the existing entrances. One of them will be slightly shifted to the south, but effectively will replace the existing. There's two entrances currently off of Western.

There's also one entrance off of Archer. So those will be retained and used for this project. We have done a traffic study for this and it is under review by CDOT, but our indications were that everything is appropriately located to not impair traffic along Western.

[Speaker 6] (1:31:53 - 1:31:59)
And as far as Archer as well, because I know when people come under the Viaduct, that's a kind of stop.

[Speaker 17] (1:32:03 - 1:32:19)
Yes, there's an existing driveway off of Archer that's essentially across from Burger King. I know that you know this area fairly well, and that will remain and it keeps the sight lines. It also keeps all of the landscaping that is along the frontage.

That's gonna remain and be actually augmented.

[Speaker 6] (1:32:20 - 1:32:21)
Awesome, thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:32:22 - 1:32:29)
Thank you, any other questions? If not, can I get a motion move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine?

[Speaker 14] (1:32:29 - 1:32:33)
Alderman Hopkins pleased to make this motion on behalf of my childhood neighborhood.

[Speaker 1] (1:32:34 - 1:32:39)
Okay, Alderman Hopkins moves to pass. Any objections to his childhood motion?

[Speaker 6] (1:32:40 - 1:32:41)
Hopkins Plaza, yes.

[Speaker 1] (1:32:42 - 1:33:14)
Hearing none, item is passed. All righty. Thank you.

Now we're gonna be moving to the middle of page five, document number 20579-T1, 15th Ward. Ordinance was referred on December 16th of 2020. Common address, 4834 South Oakley Avenue.

Change request, M22 Light Industry District to a C32 Commercial Manufacturing and Employment District. We have Mitchell Weinstein, I believe.

[Speaker 21] (1:33:14 - 1:33:18)
Hi, Chairman, this is Kevin Coyne. I work with Mitch, I'm standing in today.

[Speaker 1] (1:33:18 - 1:33:21)
Okay, let's talk about the application on Oakley, please.

[Speaker 21] (1:33:22 - 1:36:23)
Well, thank you, Chairman, and thank you to the committee for hearing us today. Again, I'm Kevin Coyne in practice with the law firm Chewack and Texan, which is located in the Loop here in Chicago. I represent the petitioner, South Oakley Venture LLC.

And today we are asking for a type one zoning map amendment from M2-2 Light Industrial District to C3-2 Commercial Manufacturing and Employment District. The purpose of the request is to allow for a very small part of this industrial building to be allowed to be used for a commercial art studio. With respect to the subject property, it is located again at 4834 South Oakley Avenue.

The property is a one-story industrial building of approximately 43,250 square feet in size, and is located near the intersection of Southwestern Avenue, near the intersection of Southwestern Avenue and 49th Street. It is located also just two blocks away from the CTA Western Avenue Orange Line and CTA Bus Line 49. The petitioner's related entity, Bridgewater Studio, is now operating from the subject site.

Bridgewater has been in operation since 2014, and their business line is in custom artwork design and fabrication. Bridgewater was recently awarded a sizable NOF award to administer and incorporate a business incubator into its building and operations. That incubator will serve neighborhood artists and provide those artists with an opportunity to find a workspace to accommodate their design and art, and also potentially may be used to accommodate a small amount of retail presence.

The incubator will again comprise a small part of this building, only about 1,000 square feet, but that was enough to trigger today's request to accommodate the use. We believe this use will have no negative impact on neighboring properties, nor detract from neighboring manufacturing. The approval of this zoning change will allow for the NOF award to proceed, which will again lead to this art incubator that will cultivate new artists and provide for artistic outlets within the city of Chicago.

Moreover, this approval will further allow for the continued growth of this Chicago small business, which is creating jobs and artistic opportunities for our city. We've received no neighbor complaints to our petition, and we also thank Alderman Lopez for his letter of support, a copy of which Chairman Tunney, I emailed to yourself and to Nicole at the beginning of the meeting today. So we respectfully request the support of the entirety of the committee today.

I'm available to answer any questions that any of you may have about the operation or petition. We have one of the managers of the business is also online in case there's an operational question that any of you may have.

[Speaker 18] (1:36:23 - 1:36:23)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:36:25 - 1:36:34)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Lopez. He's on the call. I know it's an exciting project for his ward.

Raymond, would you like to talk about this?

[Speaker 6] (1:36:36 - 1:38:12)
Yes, Chairman, thank you. And thank you again, members of the committee. And I'm sorry, Kevin, who's on the call with us today?

Eric Cook. Well, thank you. I was trying to go through Zoom to figure out who was with us.

We're joined by one of the managing partners, Eric. It's really exciting to see Bridgewater Studios in the 15th ward. They are going and growing places in our community.

They are not only creating this new space, but they're creating new opportunities for residents with an artistic bent. And yes, they were one of the recipients of a $1.4 million NOF grant to allow them to expand, to allow them to have an even greater presence in our back of the arts community. They are committed to working with our youth to allow them the opportunity to get involved with what they do, to express their artistic talent and to pursue their own dreams.

And I could not be prouder of the work that they've done so far. They've been great neighbors. We look forward not only to their continued success, but their eventual expansion to neighboring properties.

We've had Commissioner Cox from DPD come down and he was quite amazed at what they've been able to do with the space that they have currently, which I believe was a 100 year old tanning facility. But they've now turned it into something for the 21st century. Truly remarkable for what they've done.

I would ask this committee's favorable consideration on this matter and would gladly turn it over to Eric if he'd like to explain it more, or Chairman, if you have any, I think that's sufficient.

[Speaker 1] (1:38:13 - 1:38:32)
Let's ask any members of the committee if they've got any questions or comments. Okay, hearing none, I just have a comment. Are you gonna subscribe to this art therapy yourself, Raymond, or what are you gonna do?

Are you gonna be in line with this?

[Speaker 6] (1:38:33 - 1:38:37)
Chairman, if you're saying I need art therapy to become a better alderman, so be it.

[Speaker 1] (1:38:37 - 1:38:54)
Well, you know, the art of politics is what it is, sir. I'll be behind you if you decide to go, okay? I don't know, if you wanna give a couple of minutes to the Bridgewater Studio person, if you could just say if Eric's available.

[Speaker 20] (1:38:54 - 1:38:54)
I'm here, yeah.

[Speaker 1] (1:38:55 - 1:38:58)
All right, so you got a couple of customers, Eric, already.

[Speaker 20] (1:38:58 - 1:39:45)
Well, Chairman, thank you for hearing us. We are very excited to be part of the community and grow our business in the city of Chicago. It was a very wonderful thing to receive the NOS funding and have the opportunity to engage the community.

We work with After School Matters doing mentorship programs, as well as hiring locally from the community, as well as Jane Addams Resource. And the Serco is where we find a lot of our employees. So, you know, I ask for everyone's support in this matter.

It's something that we're very passionate about and that we're very optimistic about being able to grow.

[Speaker 1] (1:39:46 - 1:40:05)
Thank you very much. It sounds like an exciting project and also congrats on the NOF funding. It's a win-win, so to speak, for the community and for our city.

I don't, questions, comments? I don't see any. So can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 40] (1:40:05 - 1:40:07)
I don't have a motion, moves?

[Speaker 1] (1:40:08 - 1:40:21)
I think I saw Raymond. Raymond, do you want to make that motion? Okay, so Alderman Lopez moves to pass.

Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the item is passed. Congratulations.

[Speaker 21] (1:40:22 - 1:40:23)
Thank you, thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:40:24 - 1:40:59)
Bottom of page five, we're in the 17th ward on application number 20567. The ordinance was referred on December 16th of 2020. This common address, 6430 South Richmond Street and the change request RS3, residential single unit detached house to an RT4, residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district.

I think we have Michael Shirley on the call, I believe, to discuss this. Yes, sir. Okay, Michael.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 10] (1:41:00 - 1:41:36)
My business partner and I purchased this property approximately four months ago. Our intention is to convert the basement into two additional rolling units, in addition to the two already existing there. There are currently four parking spaces.

We've got this property and we're trying to make sure we go through the appropriate procedures to make the units legal and certainly getting the appropriate permits to make the necessary conversions to that space in the basement.

[Speaker 1] (1:41:40 - 1:41:48)
And have you talked to Alderman David Moore? And I think we have a letter of support. Is David on the call?

Yeah.

[Speaker 58] (1:41:49 - 1:42:15)
Yes, I am. Yes, I am. Thank you, Chairman.

And my team and I, we went over there as we do and could do conversion on these properties. One of the things we're looking at is just making sure a lot of these buildings are keeping up with what they already have and that they're good neighbors and they definitely are one of those good neighbors that add value to the community. So this is definitely something I support and like the favorable vote from my colleagues on this in zoning.

[Speaker 1] (1:42:16 - 1:43:36)
Thank you, David. Questions for the Alderman or the applicant? Hearing none.

Can I get a motion to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Cardona moves. Alderman Cardona moves to pass.

Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the item's passed. Thank you.

All right, we're gonna go to the top of page six. All right. And this is gonna be an item that we're gonna defer, but let me read it into the record.

Document number 20564, 25th Ward. Ordinance was referred on December 16th of 2020. Common addresses, 1930 through 2050 South Jefferson Street, 1927 through 2051 South Des Plaines Street, 2020 through 2050 South Des Plaines Street, 2037 through 2051 South Ruble Street, and 563 through 571 West Cullerton Street.

And that change request was plan development number 1123 to B2-3 Neighborhood Shopping District. This is going to be deferred by the, Tyler, are you? Okay.

[Speaker 18] (1:43:36 - 1:43:38)
Correct, Your Honor. Well, who's deferring it?

[Speaker 53] (1:43:39 - 1:43:40)
Alderman Siccio-Lopez.

[Speaker 1] (1:43:41 - 1:44:48)
Okay. So it's gonna be deferred by Alderman Siccio-Lopez. Can I get a motion to defer this item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

Cardona moves. Alderman Cardona moves that deferral. Any objections?

Hearing none, the item is deferred. All right. I have to move back to, let me see.

We have just a bit of housekeeping back to page two. This is document number 20494-T147th Ward. With ordinance was deferred on September 9th of 2020.

And again, for members of the committee, this was the item on 1800 through 1808 West Berenice Avenue and 3834 to 44 North Ravenswood. So I'm gonna recognize Alderman Martin. I know we did pass it out of committee, but I think you wanted to, I know you wanted to comment on it.

I think you have a covenant that you wanna be read into the record.

[Speaker 18] (1:44:48 - 1:45:22)
Yeah, very briefly. Thank you very much, chairman and to members of the committee. My sincere thanks for your earlier vote.

One of the things that we were working with this particular applicant on concerned affordability. They were willing to go significantly above the four units that were ARO required on site. So we'll be doing eight units.

That's reflected in a restrictive covenant that I wanted to ensure the record reflected. So again, my thanks to you all for your support earlier. And thank you chairman for this opportunity.

[Speaker 1] (1:45:23 - 1:45:27)
Thank you, Alderman. We do not need to have a vote on that. We just will have it in the record.

Okay.

[Speaker 12] (1:45:28 - 1:45:28)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (1:45:30 - 1:45:59)
Then now we're gonna be bottom of page six. Okay, bottom of page six. Document number 20587, 43rd Ward.

Ordinance was referred on December 16th of 2020. Common address 735 through 737 West Wrightwood Avenue. And the change request to B12 Neighborhood Shopping District to B13 Neighborhood Shopping District.

Tyler, you wanna take stage, sir?

[Speaker 36] (1:46:00 - 1:47:00)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Tyler Manick of Shane Banks Canyon Schwartz. I'm here on behalf of the applicant NY2 LLC, which owns the subject property at 735 to 737 West Wrightwood.

The subject property is improved with a three story mixed use building and an adjoining single story commercial building. The applicant seeks a zoning map amendment from a B12 to B13 zoning district in order to add two dwelling units and two stories to the one story commercial space. The existing three story building that has two residential units over commercial space is the remain as existing.

Since filing this application, we provided the zoning department with type one plans and a type one narrative in order to convert this application to a type one zoning map amendment. With that, I respectfully request that the committee amend this application to a type one zoning map amendment with the plans and narratives included.

[Speaker 1] (1:47:00 - 1:47:17)
So Alderman Cary Austin moves to amend the application to a type one by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to our motion? Hearing none, this item is now amended to a type one application.

[Speaker 36] (1:47:17 - 1:47:39)
All right. Prior to filing this application, the applicant met with Alderman Smith and the Park West Community Association and the Alderman has kindly provided her letter of support. Therefore, I respectfully request this committee's favorable support to approve this zoning map amendment as amended to a type one and I'd be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (1:47:40 - 1:48:47)
Questions, we do have a letter of support from Alderman Michelle Smith. Any questions for the applicant? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move this type one application forward with the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

Cardona moves. Alderman Cardona moves on the motion. Any objections?

Hearing none, the item is amended to a type one application and passed as a type one amendment. Thank you. All right.

Now we're on to page seven, top of page seven. Document number 20583-T1, 47th Ward. Ordinance was referred on December 16th of 2020.

Common address, 3437 North Palina Street and the change request, RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RM5 residential multi-unit district. Tyler, proceed on this Palina application.

[Speaker 36] (1:48:48 - 1:49:57)
Thank you again, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. Once again, for the record, my name is Tyler Manicka Shane Banks Kenyon-Schwartz. I represent the owner of 3437 North Palina SEMCO Realty Group LLC.

The subject property is improved with an existing three unit front building and an existing two unit coach house in the rear. The applicant seeks a zoning map amendment from an RS3 zoning district to an RM5 zoning district in order to add a garden apartment in the vacant existing garden level at the front building for a total of six dwelling units in this property. There will be no changes to the existing buildings and all work sought to be accomplished under the zoning map amendment in the front building will be interior.

Prior to filing this application, the owner and I met with the alderman, his zoning advisory council and shared these plans with Westlake New Neighbors. And I believe the alderman has provided this committee with his letter of support. With the support of the alderman, I respectfully request this committee's favorable recommendation and I would be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (1:49:58 - 1:50:19)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Martin. Is he still on the call? All right.

Okay, we do have a letter of support for it. Anyways, do I have questions from committee members? Hearing no questions, can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 45] (1:50:21 - 1:50:22)
Cardona also moves.

[Speaker 1] (1:50:23 - 1:50:54)
Alderman Cardona moves, do pass. Any objections to the motion? Hearing none, the item's passed.

Thank you, Tyler. Now we're middle of page seven. Document number 20566, 26th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on December 16th of 2020. Common address, 1000 to 1002 North California Avenue and the change request, B32 Community Shopping District to a C12 Neighborhood Commercial District.

[Speaker 54] (1:50:55 - 1:51:37)
Dean Maragos. Morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the honorable committee. My name is Dean T.

Maragos of the law firm of Maragos & Maragos here in Chicago at 1 North LaSalle. The purpose of this matter is to establish a tavern on the ground floor and seek a variation for public place of amusement for the live entertainment within 125 feet of an RS3 zone. We've worked with the community and we are aware of no opposition to this zoning change.

And we have received on November 30th, a letter from Alderman Maldonado in whose ward this is located, stating that he supports the zoning change. We will gladly answer any questions of the committee.

[Speaker 1] (1:51:38 - 1:51:43)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Maldonado. Any questions from committee members?

[Speaker 58] (1:51:43 - 1:51:45)
No questions, so moved by Alderman David Moore.

[Speaker 1] (1:51:45 - 1:51:59)
Well, before I get that motion, I wanted to ask Dean that name Bataglia seems pretty infamous in Chicago. Is this an operator with other establishments in the city?

[Speaker 54] (1:51:59 - 1:52:25)
He has been an excellent operator throughout the city. I've had the honor of representing him for 10 years and every project he's had, Mr. Chairman, has been a benefit to the community. We've received from every alderman that we've worked with letters of support for his projects.

Bataglia is a common name and similar to any other name. There may be individuals who have that name.

[Speaker 1] (1:52:26 - 1:52:31)
Okay, great. All right, I see Alderman Mike Rodriguez's hand is up. Mike?

[Speaker 2] (1:52:32 - 1:52:39)
Oh, I'm sorry, that was an accident chair, but I did wanna comment on the amazing shirt, sweater combination there, Dean.

[Speaker 54] (1:52:39 - 1:52:43)
Looking good, buddy. Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (1:52:43 - 1:52:58)
All right, then we have Alderman David Moore moves on this item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objection to Alderman Moore's recommendation? Hearing none, the item's passed.

[Speaker 54] (1:52:58 - 1:53:00)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee.

[Speaker 1] (1:53:01 - 1:53:37)
I expect the fireside, the next one in the background. No problem. All right, Dean, thank you.

Have a good one. All right, bottom of page seven, document number 20580, 27th Ward, ordinance was referred on December 16th of 2020. This common address, 3323 to 3369 West Grand Avenue and the change request, B23 neighborhood shopping district to an M11 limited manufacturing district.

And we have Jack Perino, I believe on this application.

[Speaker 9] (1:53:37 - 1:53:41)
Actually, I'm Katrina McGuire. You're not Jack. No, I am not Jack.

[Speaker 1] (1:53:41 - 1:53:42)
All right.

[Speaker 9] (1:53:42 - 1:54:29)
He's one of my partners, but I am filling in for him. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And really briefly, I got thrown off as a panelist so quickly by Bennett last time.

I just did want to extend the development team's gratitude to this committee and especially to Alderman Burnett for his support of our project in the Halstead Triangle. It's greatly appreciated. Great.

Moving on to this one, again, Katrina McGuire from Thompson Coburn offices at 55 East Monroe here on behalf of the applicant seeking to rezone the site to an M11 limited manufacturing district for the purpose of developing it with a car wash. That is as simple of a request as I can think of from that standpoint, from a zoning standpoint, we understand that Alderman Burnett is supportive of this project and I'm hopeful he is still on the Zoom.

[Speaker 47] (1:54:34 - 1:54:36)
Okay. Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 10] (1:54:39 - 1:54:40)
Are you talking to me?

[Speaker 1] (1:54:41 - 1:54:47)
Yes, sir. We're talking about Grand Avenue, 3323, the car wash.

[Speaker 10] (1:54:48 - 1:54:58)
I'm in full support of it. I think it's great. I need you to give me a call later on, McGuire, okay?

[Speaker 9] (1:54:58 - 1:54:59)
Sounds good, Alderman.

[Speaker 10] (1:55:00 - 1:55:01)
All right. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:55:01 - 1:55:14)
All right, but you're in support of this application. So any questions for the applicant or the Alderman? Hearing no questions, can I get a motion moved to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 40] (1:55:15 - 1:55:16)
Cardona motion.

[Speaker 1] (1:55:19 - 1:55:34)
Alderman Cardona, you're my fullback today, moved to pass. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Felix, you know, I didn't call you, you're halfback. You're the fullback.

[Speaker 9] (1:55:34 - 1:55:36)
You're right in the middle, right there. All right.

[Speaker 44] (1:55:37 - 1:55:38)
Practicing for jeopardy.

[Speaker 9] (1:55:38 - 1:55:39)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee.

[Speaker 1] (1:55:39 - 1:56:09)
Yeah. All right, thanks, Katrina. All right, top of page eight.

Document number 20570, in the 29th ward. Ordinance was referred on December 16th of 2020. Common address, 207 through 209 North Parkside Avenue.

And the change request, RS3, residential single unit detached house to an RT4 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district. We have Mr. Moore, Tom Moore.

[Speaker 22] (1:56:10 - 1:56:52)
Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name for the record is Thomas S.

Moore. And this is a current six flat on a huge lot that has a lot of space that could fit two more units. And the owner went and talked to the alderman and said that he would like to add those units and make, because they would not be in a formal affordable program, but they would be more affordable than market.

And the alderman supported it. You have a letter in support and we'd request your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (1:56:53 - 1:57:09)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Teller-Ferraro. Questions for the applicant or anyone else? All right, so no questions.

Committee members, do I have a motion to move do pass?

[Speaker 46] (1:57:09 - 1:57:11)
So moved, Mr. Chairman, Alderman Austin.

[Speaker 1] (1:57:12 - 1:57:49)
That was Alderman Kerry Austin. Moves do pass. Any objections to our motion?

Hearing none, the item is passed. Now we're moving to the middle of page eight. Document number 20568, 31st Ward.

Ordinance was referred on December 16th of 2020. Common address, 4830 West Diversity Avenue and 2820 North Cicero Avenue. Change request, B11 Neighborhood Shopping District to a B31 Community Shopping District.

Again, we have Tom Moore.

[Speaker 22] (1:57:50 - 1:59:07)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is an existing building. There'll be no changes to the exterior of the building.

It's next to a central food mart and this building is now empty. The plan is to put a state-of-the-art washers and dryers in the zoning classification. It calls it a coin-operated washing center, but in fact, now they don't use coins anymore.

They use some sort of a clicker card. But so this is purely a matter of use. A B1 does not allow the coin-operated use and the B3 would.

So to fill this empty building with a viable use that is needed in the neighborhood, we did have a meeting with the alderman and his zoning committee, and they agreed that there was not one of these, especially a newer one state-of-the-art one in the area. And the alderman issued his letter of support after that meeting, and we'd request your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (1:59:08 - 1:59:13)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Cardona, and I know he's on the call.

[Speaker 22] (1:59:15 - 1:59:18)
I don't think it was Alderman Cardona. Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me.

[Speaker 1] (1:59:20 - 1:59:29)
Okay, so I think it is Cardona. Felix, you want to say another job opportunity for your ward, it sounds like?

[Speaker 40] (1:59:30 - 2:00:16)
Yes. Thank you, Chairman, members of the committee. The owner of the property basically started doing things around their rehabilitating the corner, while Central Foods, which opened up a year and a half ago, now we have this vacant space that we're going to bring a laundromat with a card.

There's no laundromat near in sight, so it's going to benefit the neighborhood itself. Also, it's going to bring jobs. And again, it's a small business coming into the community, and especially during these times, we want to revitalize the economy, but also revitalize our community as well.

And I'm in full support of this, and thank you for your favorable consideration.

[Speaker 1] (2:00:21 - 2:00:26)
Questions for the alderman and the applicant? Hearing none, can I get a motion?

[Speaker 43] (2:00:27 - 2:00:28)
So moved by Villegas.

[Speaker 1] (2:00:28 - 2:01:02)
Alderman Villegas moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

All right, bottom of page eight. Document number 20569, 32nd Ward. Ordinance was referred on December 16th of 2020.

Common address, 3056 North Racine Avenue. And the change request. From an RT4 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district to a B11 neighborhood shopping district.

[Speaker 22] (2:01:02 - 2:02:24)
Mr. Moore. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is a kind of iconic old building with the classic with the house up, the apartment up above, and the mom and pop shop on the ground floor.

At some time in the past, it was rezoned into an R4. And some years ago, the existing business moved out of the first floor. And now the owner, who is a older lady who derives her income from the apartment upstairs and the would be commercial business downstairs, is looking for a new tenant, but no tenant could get a city business license in an R4.

So this is merely to change the zoning to reflect what is there that will allow a business to move in and get a business license. We had both a community meeting and we met with the alderman and you have a letter of support from Alderman Wagesback and we'd request your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (2:02:26 - 2:02:30)
You have a letter of support from Alderman Wagesback. I don't know, Scott, are you on the call?

[Speaker 44] (2:02:30 - 2:02:31)
Yep, right here, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:02:31 - 2:02:32)
All right, let's talk about Racine.

[Speaker 44] (2:02:33 - 2:03:05)
Okay, this I think you know is the former pantry. It's had a few names. It's right across the street from your ward there on Racine.

We worked with the Lakeview Neighborhood Group, the South Lakeview Neighbors, and Tom Moore to get this one set up for the appropriate zoning change and for the purposes of keeping that business going and keeping a viable business in there whenever we can. We'd like to make this change. So I would just appreciate the committee support for purposes of planning here.

[Speaker 1] (2:03:06 - 2:03:17)
Great. Questions for the alderman or the applicant? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine form?

[Speaker 16] (2:03:17 - 2:03:18)
So moved.

[Speaker 1] (2:03:18 - 2:03:24)
That was my halfback. That's Vice Chair Roboyas on that one.

[Speaker 44] (2:03:25 - 2:03:26)
Who grew up right down the street, I think.

[Speaker 22] (2:03:27 - 2:03:27)
That's right.

[Speaker 1] (2:03:28 - 2:03:31)
That was the peddling corner, I think, wasn't it, Ariel?

[Speaker 44] (2:03:31 - 2:03:32)
No, it wasn't.

[Speaker 1] (2:03:32 - 2:03:34)
Oh, I know which one was.

[Speaker 44] (2:03:34 - 2:03:35)
It was the candy store corner.

[Speaker 1] (2:03:36 - 2:03:52)
All right, buddy. Okay, so- Thank you, Chairman. Alderman Roboyas moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine form.

Any objections to the motion? Hearing none, the item is passed and compliments to you, Scott. I hope we can get a nice tenant on that corner.

[Speaker 44] (2:03:53 - 2:03:54)
Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:03:54 - 2:04:35)
Thank you, Tom. All right, now we're on middle of page nine, document number 20588, 47th Ward. Ordinance was referred on December 16th of 2020.

Common address is 2145 West Montrose, also 4631 North Lincoln Avenue. Change request, B12 Neighborhood Shopping District to a B13 Neighborhood Shopping District. Let me try to get this right.

Talar Berberian. Please identify yourself for the record, because I'm sorry. I hope that I didn't mispronounce your name too much.

[Speaker 51] (2:04:36 - 2:05:53)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman. Yeah, just barely. Yes, my name is Talar Berberian from Thompson-Coburn with offices at 55 East Monroe, and I'm here representing the Condo Association for 2139 West Montrose.

The president of the Condo Association should also be present, but if there are questions at the end for her, we can address those as necessary. We're here today to request the rezoning of a five-unit condo building at 2145 West Montrose. It has an alternative frontage at 4361 North Lincoln, and we're seeking a rezoning from the current B12 designation to the proposed B13.

That is in order to legalize existing FAR that's on site. The building's unit count and parking condition are legal nonconformities. That's been confirmed by the Department of Planning.

And so it's just the FAR that we're here to legalize if it's an existing condition. We did meet with the North Center neighbors about this proposal. We also have a letter of support on file from Alderman Martin's office, and we're happy to answer any questions that there may be on this project.

[Speaker 1] (2:05:54 - 2:06:01)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Martin, and it sounds like there's no changes to the footprint or the building. Is that correct?

[Speaker 51] (2:06:01 - 2:06:03)
That's correct. No changes are proposed.

[Speaker 1] (2:06:04 - 2:07:04)
Okay. All right, questions from committee members? Can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used- Move to pass, Chairman.

That was Chairman Dowell moves to pass. Any objections to our motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Thank you. And thanks for your patience, especially our resident over there, my neighbor in 47. All right, bottom of page nine, document number 20563-T1, 47th Ward, ordinance was referred on December 16th of 2020, common address 4040 through 4048 North Hermitage Avenue, and the change request from an RM 5.5 residential multi-unit district to an RM 5.5 residential multi-unit district. So what are we doing here? All right, well, let's see what Walter has, Warren, Warren, let's talk about this one, please.

[Speaker 15] (2:07:04 - 2:09:31)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. For the record, I'm Warren Silver, Silver Law Office PC representing 4046 Hermitage LLC on this beautiful day for a remote meeting pandemic or no. The building is zoned RM 5.5, but it's subject to a type one rezoning plan. We're seeking at this time to amend that type one rezoning plan to provide the prior plan called for, I believe, 12 dwelling units. This one is going to provide for 19 dwelling units and 19 parking spaces. The prior developer's plans fell through and our client acquired the site.

The rezoning plan takes in slightly less property because the development site is now a rectangle with 100 feet frontage and 165 foot lot depth. There is a unique twist to this. In addition to providing the two affordable units required by the affordable requirements ordinance, the developer is providing two additional units.

And furthermore, there are three units on the first floor that are going to be constructed as accessible units. And the developers entered into an agreement with Access Living to identify and refer disabled people who are eligible for the affordable housing to be aware of the units when they become vacant. There's a covenant that will be recorded I believe that Alderman Martin has submitted a copy of that covenant for the record, as well as his letter of support.

We did go through extensive community process as Alderman Martin typically requires with the Zoning Advisory Committee and a virtual community meeting sponsored by the Alderman's office. At this time, as I said, we've received Alderman Martin's support and we request the committee's favor as well.

[Speaker 1] (2:09:32 - 2:09:54)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Martin. Questions from committee members? I have a quick one, Warren, just to summarize the original development had how many units before it became a T1?

[Speaker 15] (2:09:54 - 2:10:41)
Okay, so originally this was a screw factory that had been vacant for many, many years. It has been through several development proposals that have fallen through. The most recent one, which is memorialized in the current type one rezoning plan called for, I believe it was 12 units and 24 parking spaces.

The developer wasn't able to complete that development and our client acquired the site and submitted a plan with 19 units, 19 parking spaces.

[Speaker 1] (2:10:41 - 2:10:50)
Right, so, but the 12 units, 24 parking spaces would have been done under the current RM 5.5 historically.

[Speaker 15] (2:10:52 - 2:11:07)
That party had rezoned the site to RM 5.5. For the 12 units and 24 parking spaces. Under their, yeah, right, under their, right. So we're gonna keep it at RM 5.5, but with an amendment to the development plan.

[Speaker 1] (2:11:07 - 2:11:20)
Great, that's what I needed to hear. All right, any questions, comments? We do have a letter of support from Alderman Martin.

Can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 40] (2:11:21 - 2:11:22)
So moved Cardona.

[Speaker 1] (2:11:22 - 2:11:28)
Alderman Cardona moves to pass. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

[Speaker 40] (2:11:28 - 2:11:29)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (2:11:30 - 2:11:57)
All right, top of page 10, 50th ward, document number 20561. The ordinance was referred on December 16th of 2020, common address 2620 West Tui Avenue. And the change request from an RS3, residential single unit detached house district and a B3 one community shopping district, all to a B3 one community shopping district.

We have Mark Neva.

[Speaker 56] (2:11:59 - 2:12:00)
Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:12:00 - 2:12:01)
Nora, I'm sorry.

[Speaker 56] (2:12:01 - 2:12:04)
Nora, yeah, it's got Nova and Nova on it.

[Speaker 51] (2:12:04 - 2:12:08)
Well, whatever, it's Nora now. Okay, all right, proceed.

[Speaker 56] (2:12:09 - 2:13:10)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My name is Mark Nora. I'm with the law firm of Pulsinelli at 150 North Riverside Plaza.

In Chicago, we represent Hebrew Theological College, which is the applicant for this request, which is for the purpose of taking a presently vacant former grammar school and religious center and to permit the operation of a full time, all day seminary college leading to a degree program. And that's the nuts and bolts. There are no changes to the physical exterior of the building.

It is consistent. This change would be consistent with the entire zoning classification for the North side of the block. And we ask, you did meet with the Alderman, Alderman Silverstein back on October 6th of this year, and we received favorable consideration.

And we respectfully ask for the committee's approval today.

[Speaker 1] (2:13:10 - 2:13:21)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Silverstein. Do we have any questions from committee members? Hearing none, can I get a motion?

[Speaker 40] (2:13:23 - 2:13:24)
So moved Cardona.

[Speaker 1] (2:13:25 - 2:13:31)
All right, so Alderman Cardona moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to his motion?

[Speaker 8] (2:13:32 - 2:13:32)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (2:13:34 - 2:13:42)
Hearing none, I think that was, yeah. All right, hearing none, the item is passed. All right, thank you and good luck to you, sir.

[Speaker 54] (2:13:42 - 2:13:45)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:13:47 - 2:14:26)
All right, middle of page 10. Okay, middle of page 10, document number 20541, third ward ordinance was referred on November 16th of 2020. Common address 319 through 331 East 43rd street and 4300 through 4318 South Calumet Avenue.

And the change request from an RM5 residential multi-unit district will be to three neighborhood mixed use district and then into the residential plan development. Scott Bornstein.

[Speaker 29] (2:14:27 - 2:14:29)
Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman, can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (2:14:30 - 2:14:30)
We can, proceed.

[Speaker 29] (2:14:31 - 2:15:11)
Great, thank you, members of the committee. Scott Bornstein from the law offices of Neal and LaRoy here on behalf of 43 Green JV LLC, which is a partnership between the Habitat company and P3 Markets. This is a project that we've been working on for some time.

And I'll just, to begin with, it's a plan development application and we did proceed before the planning commission earlier this month. So I would request that all the findings and records from that hearing be incorporated into the hearing today.

[Speaker 1] (2:15:13 - 2:15:25)
Alderman Kerry Austin moves to incorporate the records from the planning commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to our motion? Hearing none, the records are incorporated, proceed.

[Speaker 29] (2:15:26 - 2:15:59)
Thank you. So we've got a team of people and I'm gonna turn it over to them. We had a slide presentation from the planning commission hearing and we have it here today.

And our folks will go over it very quickly, understanding that we have time pressures. Before I just do that though, I know Alderman Dowell is here and we wanna thank her, of course, for her critical support in the project. And I don't know if she wants to speak before we do our presentation or after, but obviously we'd like to hear her, confirm her support.

[Speaker 1] (2:15:59 - 2:16:04)
We're gonna hear from Alderman Dowell, but Scott, I don't think we have slides.

[Speaker 29] (2:16:05 - 2:17:02)
No, I sent them to Ray, but it's, I guess we can certainly proceed. It's a 99 unit project. It's 10 stories.

It's 50% of it is affordable and 50% is market rate. It's got ground floor retail. It is really, it's a TOD project and it's really designed to jumpstart this area at 43rd and Kelly and Met.

It's an area that just hasn't had any development for a long time. And I know the team is incredibly proud to bring the project forward. And I know the neighbors are very excited and I know Alderman Dowell can confirm that.

But I think there's other people from our team here if there are any other questions, but yeah.

[Speaker 1] (2:17:02 - 2:17:42)
No, I was on the planning commission. It's a very exciting project. I know that the principals there with Habitat have been involved with that community for many, many, many decades.

And I know they did some powerful testimony at planning commission. But if there's, while we do this, Scott, why don't we, if we're done, we can ask Alderman Dowell. And then if you do have either a person from Habitat or the other partner that would like to say a few words about how exciting this is and a catalyst for the area.

But shall we move to Alderman Dowell?

[Speaker 47] (2:17:43 - 2:18:51)
Hi, thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you members of the zoning committee. I asked for your support for this project, which passed the planning commission earlier this month.

As Scott said, this is the first transit oriented development project along the South leg of the Green Line and along 43rd Street, where we have seen very little investment. We are excited about this project because this will be a catalyst for other development along 43rd Street. This project sits between the L station at 43rd Street and the Hydea Pendleton Park.

I'm very pleased with the joint venture development partnership between P3 Markets and the Habitat Company. And I want to thank Phil Beckham, Jeff Head, Charlton Hamer, Scott Bornstein, and all the rest of the team for their commitment to this development, which will be constructed by BOA Construction, who is the general contractor. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:18:51 - 2:19:01)
All right. We want to hear, Scott, is there one or two of your witnesses that would just like to opine a little bit on it?

[Speaker 29] (2:19:01 - 2:19:12)
I think if Phil Beckham is- Yeah, I think he was the one that spoke at planning commission, but I'm not- Yeah, I think it'd be worthwhile to have hear, you know, just from him briefly and then we can move on, I think.

[Speaker 1] (2:19:13 - 2:19:19)
Okay. Good afternoon. Okay.

Could you identify yourself for the record? Yes.

[Speaker 45] (2:19:20 - 2:20:46)
My name is Philip Beckham. I am a principal of P3 Markets, a real estate development firm, along with my partner, Juan Saldana. We are a black and brown development firm based in Brownsville.

And once again, Mr. Chair and committee members, I do thank you for taking this time. This project is not just a development. It is personal.

This is my neighborhood from my father to my grandfather. And it is also personal to the community and neighbors. Everything that this project entails is something that the community has been talking about and wanting for, you know, over 10 years of meetings, block club meetings and block parties.

So it's exciting to reignite a dead retail corridor with three black owned businesses. And one is a national brand and also a great to repopulate an area that has no population and we've been losing population and we're marketing towards young professionals to bring that energy back. Once again, this is more than just a project for me.

It's personal and it is also personal for our community. And I thank Alderman Dow and for all her efforts and our JB partner Habitat for helping pull this through. So thank you very much to Mr. Chair and the committee.

[Speaker 1] (2:20:46 - 2:20:54)
Thank you for your commitment to our city and perseverance. I think we have Alderman Osterman has a question.

[Speaker 20] (2:20:55 - 2:21:41)
Harry. Yes. One is if we can get the renderings, I'd like to see that not now, but at some point in time, I think I've got confidence in Alderman Dow that this is a great project.

And as Mr. Beckham said, if there's ways that this could be a catalyst for other parts of the South and West side that could use that jumpstart, I think we'd love to see it. I want to congratulate Alderman Dow, Mr. Beckham and all the partners on the team. You guys have a phenomenal leader and her that can make this happen.

But one question that relates to the 50-50 affordable and market rate, are there government subsidies that are going to go to help pay for the affordable side of it?

[Speaker 45] (2:21:44 - 2:21:44)
Go ahead Scott.

[Speaker 29] (2:21:45 - 2:21:47)
So you want to go ahead?

[Speaker 45] (2:21:47 - 2:22:12)
Yeah, go ahead. So this is, we did apply and were awarded the 9% tax credits, low income housing tax credits. And we were also awarded a state grant for the affordable housing through Senator Matty Hunter.

And we are putting in a request for CHIP.

[Speaker 20] (2:22:16 - 2:22:24)
Okay, yeah, thank you. I think if there's a way through the committee to get some of the renderings on as I'd appreciate it, but Alderman Dow, congratulations. Thank you.

[Speaker 47] (2:22:24 - 2:22:28)
Thank you, Alderman Austin. And the architect on this project is Landon Baum.

[Speaker 1] (2:22:29 - 2:22:38)
Okay, so Scott, according to my office, the link is not working from you. So you'll have to send the attachments so that we can send them to our committee members.

[Speaker 29] (2:22:39 - 2:22:43)
Oh, okay. Do you want me to try to do that right now or?

[Speaker 1] (2:22:45 - 2:22:46)
Whatever you can, yep.

[Speaker 29] (2:22:46 - 2:22:47)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:22:47 - 2:22:53)
We do have another question from Alderman Sophia King. Alderman King.

[Speaker 37] (2:22:55 - 2:23:44)
Yeah, yes, Mr. Chairman. Not so much as a question, but a statement. I just wanted to take a moment and congratulate my colleague, Alderman Dow.

We share borders. And so, you know, we're looking forward to this. I've went to a couple of community meetings about this particular project.

I know Phil Beckham to be a great community member who is very active in the community. So, you know, I'm prideful to see him be a part of this particular project. I think it will be great for both of our communities, for our community, which we share actually.

And so, Alderman Dow, continue to appreciate all that you do for your constituents and by virtue of sharing a border of mine as well.

[Speaker 1] (2:23:44 - 2:23:48)
So thank you again. And thank you, Chairman, for allowing me to speak.

[Speaker 47] (2:23:48 - 2:23:49)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:23:50 - 2:23:58)
Thanks everybody. And again, Scott, we'll work it out with the committee to make sure that we can get that. I guess the files might be too big.

[Speaker 29] (2:24:00 - 2:24:07)
Yeah, no problem. We will send a PDF or some way that you can have the file certainly.

[Speaker 1] (2:24:07 - 2:24:19)
All right, because it is a handsome project. And as Chairman Dow said, I believe it's one of the first TODs in your neighborhood, right, Chairman Dow?

[Speaker 47] (2:24:19 - 2:24:31)
That's accurate. Scott, can you just send just one slide over to Nicole so she can show it if, maybe after the next one, if the chairman will allow it.

[Speaker 1] (2:24:32 - 2:24:55)
Okay. Well, all right. We're gonna be on the lookout and we will come back to it just so that our committee sees the handsome project that it is.

Okay, I'll try to get that done. Okay. All right.

Any other questions, comments? If not, can I get a motion move to pass?

[Speaker 40] (2:24:56 - 2:24:57)
Motion do pass, Cardona.

[Speaker 1] (2:24:58 - 2:25:17)
Alderman Roboyes makes the motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine form. Any objections to that motion? Hearing none, this item is passed as revised.

And again, if we can get something quickly, I can come back to it.

[Speaker 23] (2:25:18 - 2:25:20)
Okay, we'll try.

[Speaker 1] (2:25:20 - 2:26:01)
Okay, all right. Now we're on the bottom of page 10, document number 20543, 27th Ward, ordinance was referred on November 16th of 2020. Common address, 311 through 315 North Sangamon and 901 through 925 West Wayman Street and then 310 through 314 North Peoria Street.

This change request is from a DX3, Downtown Mixed-Use District and a C11, Neighborhood Commercial District, all to a DX5, Downtown Mixed-Use District and then to business plan development. Mike Esgar, Mike.

[Speaker 12] (2:26:02 - 2:26:25)
Good afternoon, Chairman Tony, members of the committee. My name is Michael Esgar and I'm a partner at the law firm of Acosta Esgar. And this matter was approved at the plan commission at the January 21st plan commission hearing.

So as a preliminary matter, I'd like to respectfully request that the records of that proceeding be incorporated into today's hearing.

[Speaker 1] (2:26:25 - 2:26:45)
Okay, so Alderman Roboyes moves to pass to accept the plans from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that? Hearing none, is that Kerry?

Did you make the motion?

[Speaker 6] (2:26:46 - 2:26:47)
Roboyes did.

[Speaker 1] (2:26:47 - 2:26:55)
Roboyes, I thought I heard Kerry speak up too. All right, so the records are now, hearing no objections, the records are now incorporated.

[Speaker 12] (2:26:55 - 2:27:11)
Mike. Thank you very much. The second housekeeping matter is that working with DPD, we discovered a typo in the ordinance.

And so respectfully request the substitute ordinance that I have on file with DPD to be approved to move forward on that substitute ordinance.

[Speaker 1] (2:27:11 - 2:27:16)
All right, Anna from the department, are you on the call for this change?

[Speaker 12] (2:27:20 - 2:27:23)
Noah would be aware of it if he's on the call, I'm not sure.

[Speaker 43] (2:27:26 - 2:27:26)
Okay.

[Speaker 23] (2:27:26 - 2:27:35)
Yes, chairman, I am on the call. I'm looking at the Chicago plan commission passage.

[Speaker 51] (2:27:35 - 2:27:37)
Yeah, I do have the substitute ordinance.

[Speaker 1] (2:27:38 - 2:27:45)
And what is the nature of the, there was a typo that Mr. Esger said was.

[Speaker 51] (2:27:45 - 2:27:46)
Was it in the boundary?

[Speaker 12] (2:27:47 - 2:27:51)
No, it actually said DX7 instead of DX5.

[Speaker 51] (2:27:53 - 2:27:54)
I'll confirm that.

[Speaker 12] (2:27:54 - 2:27:59)
Which we're requesting a DX5 and we've been approved more as a DX5. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:28:00 - 2:28:04)
So we have it on our agenda as a DX5.

[Speaker 43] (2:28:05 - 2:28:05)
Correct.

[Speaker 1] (2:28:06 - 2:28:27)
Okay. All right. So I'm gonna ask Alderman Ravois to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections to that? Hearing none, the substitute is accepted. All right.

Anna, if you wanna get back to us, I think we're using the lesser zoning.

[Speaker 51] (2:28:27 - 2:28:32)
Yeah, I see the original was the DX7 and the substitute is the DX5, the final. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:28:33 - 2:28:37)
All right. So we've accepted that substitute and we're moving forward.

[Speaker 12] (2:28:40 - 2:32:23)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So with that, maybe we should move to the presentation. I can walk through quickly the project that was approved last week, not only the plan commission, but previously at the historic preservation permit review committee.

There's two buildings here. The one that we're looking at here is at 310 North Peoria, and it is a historic building. It's a contributing building to the landmark.

And it was previously approved before this committee and PRC with a fifth floor addition, which we are including in the new project. And then if we go to the next slide, believe it or not, this building is not a contributing building in the historic district, but it is in the district. And so we're proposing to demolish this.

And again, both buildings joined together for a 296 key hotel. And if we go to the next slide, you can see the progression. We work closely with historic preservation and the community starting back in February and worked on massing height of materials design and significant improvement to, I think what you'll see here in the current design, which is a 14 story building.

And if we go to the next slide, you can see the images from the south elevation, what you would experience from Fulton street. Again, that same design progression to where we are in the bottom right corner is what's been approved so far. And if we go to the next slide, a number of site plan improvements that we worked out with CDOT.

This area is transitioning. There's a lot of improvements that CDOT has already done. And this project contributes to some of those site improvements, including bumped out sidewalks on both ends, bicycle parking, reusing existing loading zones so that we have appropriate loading and for the hotel and for deliveries, as well as some really nice improvements to landscaping.

And finally infrastructure improvements, not only at the corner of Fulton and Peoria with four-way stop that we'll be including in our construction, but also striping and more stop signs on the corner of Peoria and Wayman. And the next slide is the approved project. This is the north elevation.

You can see how the buildings sort of work together. And again, the north elevation, the next slide will show a closeup of the ground level and the improvements to the streetscape there. It's the only building between Sangamon and Peoria on Wayman Street.

And so a lot of effort went into not only the building and design, but the site plan. Here's another closeup. You can see this is intended to be open, active pedestrian experience, significant improvement to the sidewalk landscaping.

The next slide will show a closeup of the reworked historic building where we have some outdoor seating proposed for the restaurant that would be going here. And I think if we have, we may have one more slide. This shows it from Sangamon, the hotel entrance, and then the final slide.

I think there's one more, maybe not. This is the final slide. So we, again, went through an extensive community process.

The community has approved the project and I believe Alderman Burnett is here. Remain available to answer any questions. Thank you.

[Speaker 3] (2:32:24 - 2:32:24)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (2:32:25 - 2:32:26)
Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 10] (2:32:29 - 2:33:43)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. So this is a great project and what has been worked on for about two years. They met with all of the local community organizations, was Loopgate, West Central, and now they actually was approved maybe a year ago, but planning didn't like the FAR or the, I think the FAR, and they had them to restructure it.

It turned out to be a much better project. Appreciate everyone who worked on this. This is gonna bring, I think, about 400 jobs to the community, about 200 temporary, and about a little over 100 permanent jobs.

The owner of this facility actually been around for a long time. He was partners in the Victor Hotel, which used to be a restaurant. It's good to see people who have been in the community for a long time, repping the benefits, all for the progress of the community, and that they're staying.

He's not taking the money and running. He's staying in the community. We appreciate him.

So everyone in the community support it. I support it. I ask for the committee support also.

[Speaker 1] (2:33:44 - 2:33:50)
All right. Thank you, Alderman. Questions for the applicant or the Alderman?

I think we have Alderman Cardenas.

[Speaker 13] (2:33:51 - 2:34:23)
Yeah, you know, Chairman, I'm not on the committee. Obviously, Chairman Burnett has done a tremendous job in Fulton Market. Yeah, I remember, I used to call it Victor Hotel.

Many events were there. Very beloved site. I'm glad that it became a hotel in real life.

So it's going to become a hotel in real life. I'm excited. I love Fulton Market.

Maybe in redistricting, Walter, we can talk about how we can share some of that.

[Speaker 10] (2:34:23 - 2:34:27)
You want to fight, man? Come on. Yeah.

[Speaker 1] (2:34:27 - 2:34:40)
I think you got the weights behind you, Walter. I think you can bring it in there. All right.

Other questions, comments? Mike or the Alderman, is there parking in this thing or no?

[Speaker 12] (2:34:41 - 2:34:59)
There is not any parking proposed. This is significantly TOD. It's about 530 feet from the Morgan CTA.

And as well, the existing building is a landmark. So there was no parking, but a lot of parking in the area. A lot of public parking in the area.

Yeah, until Walter gets done with it.

[Speaker 1] (2:35:00 - 2:35:07)
It won't be much parking left. All right. Let's hope the hotel business revives.

Let's hope that.

[Speaker 12] (2:35:07 - 2:35:10)
Yes, that would be the key. That is the key. All right.

[Speaker 1] (2:35:10 - 2:35:27)
Any other questions or comments on this? Hearing none. Can I get a motion to move this item by the last roll call of the vote for quorum?

Who's moving this one?

[Speaker 44] (2:35:27 - 2:35:29)
Alderman Wagesbeck moves to pass.

[Speaker 1] (2:35:29 - 2:35:43)
Alderman Wagesbeck moves to pass. On the ordinance, as well, just say as revised and substituted. Who's up here now?

[Speaker 44] (2:35:44 - 2:35:47)
I think Alderman Villegas first. I'll hold my motion if you would like.

[Speaker 53] (2:35:48 - 2:35:55)
Hold the motion, Alderman Villegas. No, Mr. Chairman, I was going to comment after this pass.

[Speaker 1] (2:35:55 - 2:36:03)
Okay. So Alderman Wagesbeck renews his motion. All those in favor.

Any opposed?

[Speaker 58] (2:36:04 - 2:36:05)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (2:36:05 - 2:36:18)
Any opposed? Okay. Hearing none.

The item is passed as revised and substituted. Now there's one thing. Chairman Villegas, would you like to comment now on it?

[Speaker 53] (2:36:18 - 2:37:01)
No, Mr. Chairman. I don't want to comment on this specific project. I just want to comment.

These are great. These are exciting projects and a lot of job creation. I wanted to know which department is responsible for monitoring all the jobs that are created once these projects are approved.

I know that during the presentation, there was a lot of discussion about jobs created, MWB participation, which is great. I'm just wondering who monitors that and how do we get a report back as to whether this is being actually attained throughout the course of the construction project.

[Speaker 1] (2:37:04 - 2:37:28)
Chairman, before I get in, I want to say as a member of the planning commission, this has come up repeatedly and I believe there's quarterly reports to the plan commission and I'm assuming that they're shared with the department of planning and such. And I would hope that upon demand, we could get these on a quarterly basis.

[Speaker 53] (2:37:28 - 2:38:00)
I think that's kind of where you want to go with this, right? Yeah, I think it'd be maybe at some point, Mr. Chairman, if the department of planning could present to the zoning committee as well. I mean, we are approving these projects and again, we know that the alderman where these projects are going in are challenging and pushing.

We just want to make sure that there's some attainment reporting back. Do not disagree. All right.

Thank you, Chairman. I agree too. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:38:00 - 2:38:14)
Thank you. Now just quickly, I'm going to go back to the third ward. We have received, I think a couple of slides.

Thank you, Michael, by the way. All right. What do we got here?

[Speaker 22] (2:38:22 - 2:38:23)
This is it.

[Speaker 47] (2:38:24 - 2:38:29)
Is there one or two? Unmute me. All right.

[Speaker 1] (2:38:29 - 2:38:31)
Scott, can you see our screen here?

[Speaker 29] (2:38:32 - 2:38:34)
I can. Can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (2:38:35 - 2:38:42)
Yeah. So quickly, I know we've already approved it, but orient the committee about this fine project here.

[Speaker 29] (2:38:43 - 2:38:55)
Oh, sure. You know what? Is Matt Snope, I think he's our project architect who's imminently more familiar with all the details.

Probably be better to have him just quickly run through it.

[Speaker 1] (2:38:55 - 2:39:02)
Okay. Quickly. We still got a few more before we can conclude.

[Speaker 43] (2:39:02 - 2:41:13)
Okay. Hello, everybody. I think if you can hear me now, I'm promoted to speaker.

Thank you for taking the time to look at our project and thanks for the vote of approval already. What you're looking at here is a 10 story building at the corner of 43rd and South Cali Met. It's adjacent to the Green Line at 43rd Street.

It has 99 apartment units, including studios, one bedroom and two bedroom units. You can see the massing from the image on the screen. It steps away from the train intentionally to sort of help mitigate the exposure to train noise.

There is a common roof deck created on a top of those setbacks at level seven. So there's an outdoor roof deck that faces north and one that faces south. And okay, we're going through the slides.

That's great. This is a view of the building from 43rd Street. It's a precast concrete construction.

Again, there are two bedroom units are on the north and south corners of the site. You can see balconies of those units. There's retail along 43rd Street.

So an important aspect of the project is to promote, invigorate the existing retail corridor along 43rd. This slide shows the proposed residential apartment entrance of South Cali Met and the apartments above. Last feature maybe to point out, there's a significant setback from the existing two-story residential building south of us.

And we've created, we've used that space to create an outdoor patio and landscape terrace area. The surface parking lot is accessed off of the alley. So there's no curb cut on Cali Met.

Parking for 24 cars, which is significantly reduced to its location adjacent to the train line. So again, thank you very much. If there's any questions, I'm happy to respond.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:41:14 - 2:41:30)
And I know that as Chairman Dowell said, this is providing a new stack of housing for the neighborhood, which is more dense than under the TOD smaller units to diversify your housing mix, I believe on this one. So congratulations. All right, thanks, Scott.

[Speaker 29] (2:41:31 - 2:41:32)
Thank you again, much appreciated.

[Speaker 1] (2:41:33 - 2:42:21)
Okay, all right, good luck. Now we're in the top of page 11, document number 19927, 28th Ward. Ordinance was referred on January 23rd of 19.

Common address is 1100 through 1118 Southwestern Avenue in the change request, C12, Neighborhood Shopping District to B23, Neighborhood Mixed Use District. I know we have Nick Fatikas. Oh, we have Daniel, okay.

All right, just for the edification of the committee, this was originally in front of us, but it was in the first ward. So explain how we're moving forward with this because there's a time lapse here that's a little extraordinary. Daniel.

[Speaker 18] (2:42:22 - 2:44:01)
That's right. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Daniel Box.

I'm an attorney with the Law Offices of Sandbanks located at 221 North LaSalle. Like Alderman Tunney had just shared with the committee, this zoning change has actually been previously before this committee. The exact same application was before this committee in early 2019, at which time we had realized a typographical error with that application, mistakenly indicating that then Alderman Moreno was the first ward was the ward in which this property address was located.

That of course was a mistake. This address is actually located in the 28th ward. We corrected that mistake at the time we presented the application before this esteemed committee.

And the application was then supported. It was then approved by this committee for ratification by city council. When this application was then moved for ratification by city council, that typographical error was not corrected.

And then Alderman Moreno, of course not recognizing this address, decided to defer this item at that time. It wasn't until this applicant went forward with permitting and was actually subsequently denied permitting that we realized what had happened at city council, that the zoning map was never changed. And as such, we are just here today to rehear that application.

It's the exact same application with no changes whatsoever that was previously ratified in January or February of 2019.

[Speaker 1] (2:44:04 - 2:44:17)
Daniel, just so we have the common address is 1100 through 1118 Southwestern Avenue. Was the typo, was it Northwestern Avenue versus Southwestern that was the problem or what?

[Speaker 18] (2:44:18 - 2:44:32)
To be honest, I don't even think that there was a typographical error with the address. I think our office just mistakenly identified the first ward as the correct ward. We sometimes use the same templates from previous application.

[Speaker 1] (2:44:32 - 2:44:45)
And I'm assuming that that was just- I just know that 1100 North would be closer to the first ward than the 28. That's what I was thinking out loud. Okay, well, we're here, we're here.

So let's keep going.

[Speaker 18] (2:44:46 - 2:45:50)
Great, well, just to reiterate what the nature of the zoning change request, the property is still currently improved with several buildings. One is a three-story mixed use building. One is a one-story commercial building.

There's another one-story garage and there's also a surface parking lot. The applicant is seeking to raise the existing structure and to develop the subject property with two new buildings, both four-story, 21-unit residential buildings. On-site garage parking for 21 vehicles in each building will be located at the rear of the lot.

And in order to permit the project, the applicant is seeking a zoning change from a C-1-2 neighborhood commercial district to a B-2-3 neighborhood mixed use district. Our office, just as it did with the application in 2019, has worked with the local community and with Alderman Irvin on this project. I believe that he has tendered a letter of support or email of support to Nicole for this project.

And with that, I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have.

[Speaker 1] (2:45:51 - 2:46:05)
Thank you, we have received a letter of support from Alderman Irvin. Questions from committee members? Hearing none, can I get a motion moved to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 6] (2:46:06 - 2:46:07)
So moved, Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 1] (2:46:07 - 2:46:16)
Alderman Ray Lopez moves to pass. Any objections to the motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Thank you, Dan. Okay.

[Speaker 18] (2:46:16 - 2:46:16)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (2:46:17 - 2:46:59)
Okay, bottom of page 11. A document number 20510, 40th Ward. Ordinance was referred on September 9th of 2020.

Common address 6300 North Ridge Avenue and 1925 West Home Avenue. And the change request is plan development number 253 and RS3 residential single unit detached house district to plan development number 253 as amended. And I think we have Joe Gattuso.

Joe, okay. Would you wanna proceed on this project that I think was in front of planning commission, right?

[Speaker 12] (2:46:59 - 2:47:00)
Okay, yeah.

[Speaker 30] (2:47:00 - 2:47:47)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My name is Joseph P. Gattuso, the law firms Taft, Stettinius and Hollister, LLP, 111 East Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois.

I am pleased to be here this afternoon on behalf of the applicant, Visa Recordia Home, which is seeking to expand its campus in the 40th Ward of the city. Joining me this morning are Kevin Connolly, Miss Recordia's chief financial officer, Hugh Connolly, Miss Recordia's director of development and Douglas Moser of HKM Architects, the project architects, who are all available to answer any questions committee members may have. This matter was considered and recommended for passage by the Chicago Plan Commission on December 17th, 2020.

I ask that the record of those proceedings be incorporated into the record before the committee today.

[Speaker 1] (2:47:48 - 2:48:01)
So Alderman Osterman moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that motion? Hearing none, the records from plan commission are incorporated, continue.

[Speaker 30] (2:48:03 - 2:50:30)
If one is from Chicago, one is undoubtedly aware of Miss Recordia Home and the work that it does with children and adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Miss Recordia currently serves 600 children and adults on its campus, which is generally located at 6300 North Ridge Avenue in residential institutional plan development number 253 and has a waiting list of over 300 people at present. If we could change to the next slide, please.

If we have the slides up. Okay, I had sent an abbreviated group of slides, but it looks like the entire, okay, that's yeah. Change to the next slide, please.

Splendid, thank you. Miss Recordia seeks to amend PD 253 by adding the property located at 1925 West Thome Avenue, which is immediately South of the existing campus as depicted on the site plan. The Thome Avenue parcel is approximately 2.86 acres in size and the current campus is just under 32 acres. The proposed amendment is mandatory to allow the inclusion of the Thome Avenue property within the boundaries of PD 253. Next slide, please. Adding this new parcel will allow for the construction of approximately 16 new intermediate care facility buildings of one and two stories.

One or two stories, pardon me, there are both. Each building will accommodate between six and eight residents and approximately 48 staff members will live with and assist those residents. Next slide, please.

The architecture of the buildings is similar to the other buildings located throughout Miss Recordia's campus. A driveway is planned through the site, which will give the newly improved parcel the feel of a quiet residential street as shown on the perspective. This is of critical importance to Miss Recordia given the nature of the population it serves and how it must provide those services and how it cares for its residents.

If we could walk through the next three slides slowly, please, we have worked closely with Alderman Vasquez and the community on this project. And I believe that the Alderman has submitted a letter of support to the committee. I have nothing further, but we will be happy to answer any questions committee members may have.

[Speaker 1] (2:50:32 - 2:50:47)
Okay, thanks, Joe. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Vasquez. We do, okay.

Questions from or comments, committee members, who's up? Yep.

[Speaker 20] (2:50:47 - 2:51:49)
Posterman. Okay, Harry, do you want to talk about this magnificent project? I want to talk about this magnificent project and just thank the team that put this together, specifically the Conleys, Kevin Conley and Sister Rosemary.

I think anyone that knows Miss Recordia knows that they do amazing work. The need is vast and they keep it going. And also as someone who's grown up in this neighborhood, very near this, Miss Recordia has grown throughout the years to really create a campus environment for the people that they serve and their families.

And I think this is a wonderful addition. And I think that we all look forward to supporting. I think they also have a bakery that's going to open up in the near future, right down the street.

So with gluten-free donuts, Tom, not to compete with cinnamon rolls, but this is a great project and I'm very proud to support it today. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:51:49 - 2:52:28)
Thank you, Harry. And thank you for the comments also. I don't see any other hands up, but as I said in plan commission, the work that they do is, as I said in plan commission, nothing short of a miracle.

So the opportunity to expand their campus, working with the residents that surround it is a real credit to the community, to Miss Recordia and to the Aldermen. So I wanted to compliment the team. And also I was hoping Sister Rosemary was going to be on the call.

[Speaker 44] (2:52:28 - 2:52:35)
Chairman, she was on the last one, as you know, she couldn't be here this morning, but she wants to send along how grateful she is to everybody in the Donut.

[Speaker 1] (2:52:35 - 2:52:39)
Yeah, she's going to go to heaven and she's going to get us all in behind her.

[Speaker 44] (2:52:40 - 2:52:44)
And as Alderman Osterman said, there's no competing with Ann Sather's.

[Speaker 1] (2:52:44 - 2:52:56)
Yeah, well, gluten-free is a competitor. I'll let that slide, okay? All righty.

Well, so let me get a motion to move to pass on this item.

[Speaker 6] (2:52:58 - 2:52:59)
So moved Alderman Lopez, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:52:59 - 2:53:19)
Alderman Ray Lopez moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that motion? Hearing none, the item is passed as revised, correct?

Yeah, okay.

[Speaker 30] (2:53:19 - 2:53:22)
Thank you, Chairman, and thanks to all for their kind comments.

[Speaker 1] (2:53:22 - 2:53:31)
And your backdrop is one of the more interesting backdrops. I don't see a cub or socks emblem in there, but I feel like I'm in Europe somewhere.

[Speaker 56] (2:53:31 - 2:53:32)
That's in the other room.

[Speaker 1] (2:53:32 - 2:54:18)
Yeah, all right, buddy. All right, be well, thank you. All right, here we are now on our last couple items here before we get into the mayorals.

And we'll start on page 12. Document number 20345, 46th Ward. Ordinance was referred on February 19th of 2020.

Common address, 1038 through 1054 West Wilson Avenue, 4600 through 4608 North Kenmore, and 4600 through 4612 North Winthrop. A change request. Residential business plan development number 1329.

The residential business plan development number 1329 as amended. Katie Janke-Dale. Thank you for your patience, Katie.

Can you proceed on this one?

[Speaker 28] (2:54:19 - 2:54:43)
Thank you, good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Katie Janke-Dale with the law firm of DLA Piper located at 444 West Lake, which represents the applicant 1050 Wilson Partners LLC. As a preliminary matter, this application was considered and recommended for approval at the December 17th, 2020 plan commission hearing.

We'd request that a transcript of that hearing be incorporated into the record here today.

[Speaker 1] (2:54:44 - 2:54:58)
Alderman Raymond Lopez moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the records are incorporated and continue, Katie.

Thank you.

[Speaker 28] (2:54:59 - 2:55:41)
This is a two sub-area PD, PD number 1329 that's located at the Northwest corner of Wilson and Kenmore. Sub-area A consists of a two-story historic building that's proposed for a future venue use, which is shown on this next slide. Wanna advance it one more.

Sub-area A is shown on the left. Sub-area B is proposed for a new residential building, which is shown on the next slide, which will consist of 62 units in a five-story building with 13 parking spaces. We worked with Alderman Keppelman on this, and I think I saw him on the screen, but we also should have a letter of support on file from him.

With that, we're available for any questions that you may have.

[Speaker 47] (2:55:42 - 2:55:43)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (2:55:45 - 2:55:51)
Katie, I'm sorry, just for my own modification, there's an existing theater there?

[Speaker 28] (2:55:52 - 2:56:02)
No, so part of the amendment that we're doing is to allow for a venue as a permitted use in the existing building on the left-hand side of the screen.

[Speaker 1] (2:56:03 - 2:56:15)
Not identified yet though? Correct. Okay.

All righty. Let's see, what do we have? We have Alderman Keppelman.

Is he on the call? James?

[Speaker 34] (2:56:16 - 2:56:17)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:56:17 - 2:56:20)
You've been quiet, James. We haven't heard from you yet.

[Speaker 34] (2:56:21 - 2:56:21)
That's true.

[Speaker 1] (2:56:21 - 2:56:24)
All right, but this is exciting, so let's talk about it.

[Speaker 34] (2:56:25 - 2:57:03)
So this is really just an amendment to the planned development, opening up the building on the left, 1050 West Wilson, to a music venue that's not yet been identified, but we all know who it is. And then for the other side, it's on the 4600 block of North Kenmore, about a half block from my home. It is a reduction from eight stories to five stories.

Other than that, it was really not much of a change. So I ask my colleagues to approve this.

[Speaker 1] (2:57:04 - 2:57:15)
All right, questions for the applicant or the Alderman? Hearing none, I get a motion to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine form.

[Speaker 44] (2:57:16 - 2:57:18)
Move to pass. Alderman, mic is back.

[Speaker 1] (2:57:18 - 2:57:34)
Alderman, do pass on the item. Any objections to the motion? Hearing none, the item is passed as revised.

That's it, congratulations.

[Speaker 23] (2:57:35 - 2:57:36)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:57:36 - 2:58:05)
All right, now we're moving on our last item on the regular agenda, I believe. Document number 20440, 48th Ward. Ordinance was referred on July 22nd of 2020, common address 5051 North Broadway.

Change request, residential business plan development number 1347 to residential plan development number 1347 as amended. Katie, you wanna talk about this one?

[Speaker 28] (2:58:06 - 2:58:31)
Thank you again for the record. My name is Katie Jankydale with the law firm of DLA Piper at 444 West Lake, which represents the applicant at 5050 North Broadway property LLC. This matter was also considered and recommended for approval at the December 17th, 2020 plan commission hearing.

We would request that a transcript of that record or hearing record be incorporated today.

[Speaker 1] (2:58:31 - 2:58:42)
Ray Lopez moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that? Hearing none, the records are incorporated and we can continue.

[Speaker 28] (2:58:43 - 3:00:05)
Thank you. Next slide, please. So this also is a two-sub area PD that's shown on the screen, PD 1347.

It's generally located at 5050 North Broadway on the West side of the street and 5051 on the East side. Next slide. Sub area A, which is shown here, was completed in 2019 and consists of 342 units.

Next slide. Sub area B is on the other side of Broadway and will consist of 180 units in a five-story building. And that is the subject of this amendment, which is required to allow residential on the ground floor along Winona, as shown here on the right-hand side of the screen, which would replace previously proposed commercial in that location.

The portion of sub area B that is fronting Broadway on the left-hand side will still have commercial uses on the ground floor. The East side of the street is located in Alderman Osterman's ward and you should have a letter of support on file from him. The other portion of the plan development on the West side is in the 47th ward.

And while this amendment will have no impact on that sub area, we also received a letter of no opposition from Alderman Martin, which should also be in the file. With that, I'm available for any questions, but would respectfully request your positive recommendation of this application. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:00:05 - 3:00:08)
All right. Thank you, Katie. Alderman Osterman.

[Speaker 20] (3:00:08 - 3:00:38)
This is a second phase of a very dynamic development that occurred with the renovation of the A.N. Insurance Building that's been completed. This will be the second phase of it. I support it.

The developer involved was able to increase the affordability at myself and Alderman Poirier's request when this was first passed. So I'd like to support the amendment and look forward to the development of this site. Great.

[Speaker 1] (3:00:38 - 3:00:48)
Thank you, Alderman. Any questions for the applicant or the Alderman? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 40] (3:00:49 - 3:00:49)
Cardona moves.

[Speaker 1] (3:00:50 - 3:01:11)
Alderman Cardona moves do pass. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the item is passed as revised.

All right. Thank you. All right, that concludes the map amendments.

So what do we do?

[Speaker 19] (3:01:12 - 3:01:12)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (3:01:13 - 3:01:20)
Okay, we're gonna go out of order to stick with Alderman Osterman, right? Is that what we're doing?

[Speaker 28] (3:01:20 - 3:01:20)
Correct.

[Speaker 1] (3:01:20 - 3:01:41)
Okay, so that's, is the document number 02020-5914 in the 48th Ward, the historical landmark designation for the Perkins Nordine House located at 6106 North Kenmore. We've got Matt Crawford here from Department of Planning and he's gonna make the presentation. Matt.

[Speaker 3] (3:01:42 - 3:01:45)
Thank you, Chairman. Members of the committee, can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (3:01:46 - 3:01:47)
Loud and clear.

[Speaker 3] (3:01:47 - 3:03:17)
Very good. So again, Matt Crawford, Coordinating Planner with the Department of Planning and Development. I'm here to recommend on behalf of the Commission on Chicago Landmarks that the Perkins Nordine House be designated as a Chicago landmark.

Next slide. The house is located at 6106 North Kenmore in the Edgewater community in the 48th Ward and Alderman Osterman has supported the designation. Next slide.

The house is a rare survivor of the large homes that define the early history of Edgewater. It is also an excellent example of the arts and crafts and international design movement that originated in England. Next slide.

In addition, the house was designed by Pond & Plan, brothers and accomplished architects from Chicago with the turn of the 20th century, who also were great supporters of progressive movements in Chicago. Next slide. Finally, the house is important for its association with the late Ken Nordine, a nationally significant jazz and spoken word artist who resided and worked out of this house from 1951 until his passing in 2019.

Next slide. The current owners of the property, Richard Logan and Angela Spinozzi have consented to the landmark designation and they're restoring the building. So on behalf of the Commission on Chicago Landmarks, I recommend passage of the ordinance designating the house as a Chicago landmark and I'm here to answer any questions you have.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:03:17 - 3:03:23)
Thank you, Matt. Handsome house. Alderman Osterman.

[Speaker 20] (3:03:24 - 3:03:42)
Just would ask the committee's support in this. This is a historic building in our community. The community is in support of the historic designation and the new owners are gonna fix it up in the way that will keep it for many, many years to come.

But I support this today and would ask the committee's support.

[Speaker 1] (3:03:43 - 3:03:45)
Questions I see.

[Speaker 14] (3:03:50 - 3:04:50)
Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman. No questions. Just wanted to state for the record that I'm very pleased to see this.

Ken Nordine was an amazing artist. He was also a personal friend of mine. He and his late wife, Beryl, just two of the most kind-hearted, wonderful people you would ever meet.

And also two of the biggest Blackhawks fans I've ever known in my life. And I'm just happy thinking back that they got to see their beloved Blackhawks win the Stanley Cup, not once, not twice, but three times during their twilight years. They were great Chicagoans and both were actually quite remarkable artists so that their legacy will live on in so many ways, including the landmark designation for the home that Ken did so much of his recording in his home studio and is so closely associated with the body of his amazing career.

I'm pleased to support this and it's a wonderful gesture for the Nordine family. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:04:51 - 3:05:02)
Thank you, Alderman. I don't see any other hands. So no further questions.

Do I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 14] (3:05:03 - 3:05:04)
So moved, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (3:05:04 - 3:05:21)
That is Alderman Hopkins moves to pass. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Congratulations. All right, we're gonna stay on the landmark items and I'm gonna move back to page eight. Well, all right.

[Speaker 47] (3:05:21 - 3:05:22)
The addendum.

[Speaker 1] (3:05:22 - 3:05:47)
The addendum. So we're gonna move to document number 02020-5906 in the 20th ward, that being the historical landmark designation for the Emmett Till and Mamie Till Mobley House at 6427 South St. Lawrence Avenue. Again, we have Matt Crawford here from the Department of Planning and developed to make the presentation.

Matt.

[Speaker 3] (3:05:48 - 3:10:22)
Thank you, Chairman and members of the committee. I'm here to recommend on behalf of the Landmarks Commission that the Emmett and Mamie Till Mobley House be designated as a Chicago landmark. This building is a modest two flat, but it's a monumental historic and memorial significance.

It's a brick two flat at 6427 South St. Lawrence Avenue. And it was the home of Emmett Till and his mother, Mamie Till Mobley. It was from this house that Emmett Till left with his uncle to visit relatives in Mississippi in 1955.

The 14 year old Till was lynched during the trip. Tragic murder of Till became a symbol of the brutality of racism in America. And it galvanizes civil rights movement in this country.

Next slide. The home is located in the Woodlawn community area in the 20th Ward and Alderman Jeanette B. Taylor supports the landmark designation.

Next slide, please. Emmett Till was born in 1941 at Cook County Hospital. Emmett and his mom, Mamie would live in Summit, Illinois and then Detroit before finally settling into the two flat in Woodlawn in November, 1951.

Next slide. Emmett turned 14 in 1955. That summer, his uncle from Mississippi invited him and other cousins from Chicago down South for a visit to extended family.

Emmett and his cousins and his uncle took the city of New Orleans train to the small town of Webb, Mississippi. Next slide. On August 24th, Emmett and his cousins visited this store in Money, Mississippi owned by Roy Bryant.

Bryant, who was white, was out of town on business and the store was being run by his wife, Carolyn. Accounts of what happened during Emmett's visit to the store differed, but it got around to Bryant that Emmett Till had a verbal interaction with his wife, an act that in the Jim Crow South could mean lynching for a black man. Next slide.

Three days later, Bryant's husband, Roy and his brother, J.W. Milam kidnapped, tortured and shot Till and dumped his body in the Tallahatchie River. Mamie Till had her son's body returned to Chicago for funeral and burial. She took the extraordinary and bold step to display her son's mutilated body in an open casket.

Pictures of Emmett's battered body were published in Chicago's Jet Magazine. The photographs were a catalyst for African-Americans wanting political and social change. After the funeral, Emmett's mother traveled to Mississippi to attend the trial of Bryant and Milam who had been charged with her son's murder.

After one hour of deliberation, the jury acquitted the men who would later confess to the murder. Next slide, please. Emmett's killing and the acquittal of his murderers motivated African-Americans to demand justice.

Three months after the trial, Rosa Parks cited Till's murder for her refusal to give up her seat to a white passenger on a Montgomery City bus. Soon after, a young and relatively unknown minister named Martin Luther King Jr. called for a citywide bus boycott and the Civil Rights Movement in America was born. For more than four decades, Mrs. Mobley spoke about racial injustice, worked to bring her son's killers to justice and help children living in poverty. She worked as a teacher in Chicago public schools for 23 years. She died in 2003 at age 81. Next slide, please.

The property is now owned by Blacks and Green, a neighborhood nonprofit organization led by Naomi Davis. Ms. Davis has consented to landmark designation and plans to convert the house to a place associated with Emmett and his mom's memory. So on behalf of the commission, I respectfully recommend passage of the ordinance designating the Till House as a Chicago landmark.

And again, I'm here to answer any questions. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:10:22 - 3:10:24)
Thank you, Matt.

[Speaker 53] (3:10:32 - 3:10:34)
Thanks, Chairman.

[Speaker 44] (3:10:35 - 3:10:52)
I just wanna say thank you to Matt for putting this piece together here on Emmett Till's home. And with the ownership, you mentioned it's a not-for-profit or did I mistake that?

[Speaker 3] (3:10:53 - 3:10:58)
That's correct, Alderman. This is a nonprofit organization called Blacks and Green.

[Speaker 4] (3:10:58 - 3:11:01)
They're doing a lot in the Westwood community.

[Speaker 44] (3:11:02 - 3:11:15)
And is the city, are they looking at some of the rehab of the outside of the property or have they applied for anything, any historic tax credits or anything like that based on the home itself?

[Speaker 3] (3:11:16 - 3:11:47)
They're still evaluating. The property has a number of condition issues that need to be addressed and Blacks and Green is aware of those issues. So we have not seen a permit yet, but the department is committed to working with Blacks and Green on this project, as well as to secure vacant lots immediately next to it so that this memorial site is respected and however Blacks and Green want to move it forward.

[Speaker 44] (3:11:48 - 3:12:14)
Okay, thank you for that. I think it would be interesting if you could give us an update at some point, either on the committee or via the chairman, just to see the progress of that and what landmarks might be doing in terms of historical marker. But thank you, chairman.

That's all I had. I just wanted to see if we can get an update on that in the future. Thank you.

Thank you, Matt.

[Speaker 3] (3:12:14 - 3:12:19)
Thank you, chairman. Can I add one other point that I neglected to mention in my presentation?

[Speaker 1] (3:12:19 - 3:12:20)
Yes, Matt.

[Speaker 3] (3:12:20 - 3:12:43)
That this report was brought to us by Preservation Chicago. They did a lot of the research and writing for this report in concert with a professor at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, in concert with Naomi Davis at Blacks and Green. So they deserve a ton of credit for bringing this to the commission.

[Speaker 1] (3:12:46 - 3:12:49)
Thank you. Alderman Kappelman.

[Speaker 34] (3:12:50 - 3:13:10)
Yes, thank you so much. A quick question. Because this also has national significance and it really brought forth a lot of work to address racism that still has to continue on.

Is there been any thought about making this also under the National Historic Registry?

[Speaker 3] (3:13:13 - 3:13:34)
I think that would be totally appropriate, Alderman. This would certainly qualify as a National Register property and perhaps even qualify as what's called an NHL or a National Historic Landmark, which is a step above simple National Register. Thank you.

[Speaker 34] (3:13:34 - 3:13:38)
That's more work for us to do, but it's worth it. I think so.

[Speaker 1] (3:13:39 - 3:14:20)
Thank you, Alderman. And I know we have a strong support from Alderman Taylor, Alderwoman Taylor. She couldn't stay on this late in the call, but obviously she is in firm support of this, as we all are.

And it looks like it could be the first of many steps to recognize both the positive and the negative in regards to Emmett Till, but so be it. All right, if there are no more questions or comments from committee members, do I get a motion moved to pass by the same roll call that was used to establish quorum?

[Speaker 6] (3:14:20 - 3:14:22)
Moved Chairman Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 1] (3:14:22 - 3:14:54)
Alderman Ray Lopez moves to pass. Any objections to the motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

All right, next landmark designation is document number 02020-6031. In the 42nd Ward, the historical landmark designation for the Illinois Bell Building located at 225 West Randolph Street. And again, we have Matt Crawford to make the presentation.

[Speaker 3] (3:14:55 - 3:16:32)
Matt. Thank you, Chairman and members of the committee. Here to recommend on behalf of the Landmarks Commission that the Illinois Bell Building, a 31 story skyscraper built in the loop in 1966, be designated as a Chicago landmark.

Next slide. The building is located at Randolph and Franklin in the loop in the 42nd Ward. Next slide.

Historically, the building reflects Chicago's successful drive to retain corporate headquarters, usually in modern high-rises in the 1960s, while other cities were losing these businesses to suburban office campuses. Next slide. Architecturally, the building is a significant example of new formalism, a rare architectural style that emerged late in the modern movement.

Finally, the building is significant for its architects, Holabird and Brute, who designed many Chicago landmarks that you can see here. Next slide. The designation is being pursued along with a class L application by the building's contract purchaser that plans to renovate the building to accommodate modern commercial uses, offices.

VPD has the written consent of both the contract purchaser and the current owner of the building for the landmark designation. So on behalf of the commission on Chicago landmarks, I respectfully recommend passage of the ordinance designating the Illinois Bell Building as a Chicago landmark. And of course, I'm here to answer any questions.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:16:33 - 3:16:48)
All right. Questions, comments, committee members? I just, first of all, I think it's a handsome building.

Matt, was this 1966? Did I see that?

[Speaker 3] (3:16:49 - 3:17:13)
That's right, Chairman. 1966, example of modern architecture and it's unusual in the sense that it's clad with not just black glass that we see all the time, but this granite marble finish. This is pretty unusual stuff for the 60s, but it was a style called new formalism.

We don't have many examples of this in Chicago.

[Speaker 1] (3:17:13 - 3:17:29)
Yeah, that's what I was saying. For the 60s, it's pretty dramatic and I don't see a lot of that in and around town. So the only other one that, what was the Inland Steel Building though?

What year was that?

[Speaker 3] (3:17:30 - 3:17:47)
That is also a Chicago landmark. It's a bit earlier, but that's more mid-century modern. Other examples of new formalism in Chicago would be the American Dental Association Building in Streeterville.

Again, it's pretty rare. You see a lot of this in California, but not too much in Chicago.

[Speaker 1] (3:17:48 - 3:17:54)
Beautiful building. Questions, comments? Ray Lopez, Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 6] (3:17:56 - 3:18:11)
Thank you. Excuse me. Thank you, Chairman.

I just had one quick question for Matt, kind of for these three items and then kind of like for the next four, what's the cost of the weight of the landmark fee for these three items?

[Speaker 3] (3:18:13 - 3:18:48)
Alderman, we don't charge a fee to landmark buildings. Sometimes we prepare the reports as staff members. Sometimes when a developer is seeking landmark designation, for example, in the case of Illinois Bell, we will tell that developer because you're seeking designation as part of an incentive, we ask them to hire a consultant to prepare the report for us and for you so that staff time is not being devoted to something where an incentive is involved.

[Speaker 6] (3:18:49 - 3:18:58)
So then in the cases of the ones that are following, the five next where you ask for fee waivers, what are the values of those?

[Speaker 3] (3:18:59 - 3:19:35)
Correct. And my colleague, Michelle Rimes can answer that, but those fee waivers are related to the fact if you're applying for a building permit to change or alter your landmark property in Chicago, because landmarking does impose additional responsibilities on homeowners, city council has adopted the fee waiver ordinance to reduce that burden slightly. So it waives the building permit fee that applicants would pay to the department buildings.

[Speaker 6] (3:19:36 - 3:19:38)
Thank you.

[Speaker 14] (3:19:40 - 3:19:48)
Further questions, comments? All right. Alderman Hopkins moves approval and deposits 20 cents for the next three minutes.

[Speaker 1] (3:19:50 - 3:20:11)
So Alderman Hopkins moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum, any objections? Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Now we are going to go into the mayoral amendments. All right. What page is it for them?

[Speaker 38] (3:20:11 - 3:20:12)
Top of the addendum.

[Speaker 1] (3:20:13 - 3:20:54)
Top of the addendum. We're moving on to document number 020206207. Mayoral amendment modifying municipal code chapter 17-7 by adding new section 17-7-0580 establishing a multi-unit preservation Pilsen district.

And we have Patrick Murphy and Commissioner Navarro hopefully still on the call to testify. So who would like to start? I would assume Patrick Murphy.

[Speaker 2] (3:20:55 - 3:21:10)
I can chairman. I can run through a brief overview of the ordinance and then I can share a presentation, run through a few sample blocks just to show how the ordinance would play out. And then I can turn it over to Commissioner Navarro.

[Speaker 51] (3:21:12 - 3:21:13)
Okay. All right.

[Speaker 1] (3:21:14 - 3:21:25)
I'm sorry, we have Daniel Gertz. We don't have, okay. So it's Daniel Gertz, I think from housing that's going to be picking up that portion of it.

So let's start on the zoning portion, please.

[Speaker 2] (3:21:26 - 3:25:29)
Okay. Yes, sir. All right.

On my screen is a brief summary of the ordinance. So I'll just start from the top here about the 606. I'm sorry about Pilsen.

Good afternoon, chairman, members of the committee. For the record, my name is Patrick Murphy with the department of planning and development. I'm joined here, as you said, by Daniel Hertz from the city's department of housing.

And we are here to discuss proposed anti-displacement changes that will impact certain sections of the municipal code in the zoning chapter as they regulate the types of residential structures which can be established based on the context of a particular block and its associated zoning districts. Specifically to the Pilsen district, and I'll run through these slides here next after I get done, is that our proposal is to restrict the prevalence of single family homes and two flats in RT4 zoning districts, along with all RM districts, all B and all C districts within a specific boundary within Pilsen that I will run through next. Outlined in blue is the area of Pilsen that we are proposing for this ordinance.

The current zoning districts are identified in the three colors in the middle on the bottom of the chart. As you can see an overwhelming amount of the residentially zoned properties are already zoned RT4 up through RM6.5. So those are the middle range, the starting to get three flat and larger buildings in the city up to our most dense neighborhood residential zoning districts. The green and the purple that you will see that run along various commercial corridors indicate the commercial and business zoning in which this would also apply.

Excuse me. The next few slides will run through a few examples of blocks where we have gone out and analyzed the structures that are there and the occupancy of those buildings from a dwelling unit standpoint, not individual people. And how this ordinance could impact those going forward.

So here we have 13 residential structures, like the chart says on the right hand side of the screen. Six are single family and two flat. Six are three units or more and one is non-residential.

This would allow for only the construction of three unit plus buildings within this block. So if a building were to be purchased for renovation or if a vacant lot were to be rebuilt because of the context of the block, a density requirement would be a three units or more under the zoning for this particular block. Again, we went to the 1600 block of Alport, did the same analysis of the existing structures and their usage today.

The analysis is on the side, but the result is that because of the prevalence of single family homes and two flats, it would be allowed for a single family home or two flat structure to still be provided because the context of the block, as we were saying before, allows for that lower density. There is not a predominance of larger, more than three flat structures along the block. 1800 block of West Cullerton, same analysis was done of the 22 structures, 14, so more than 50% were a single family home and two flats and that would allow for a single family home or two flat structure to be provided.

And finally, we did the 2200 block of West 21st Place, 22 total structures. And again, because of the lower density that exists in some of these areas, even with the RT4 zoning, it would still allow for the lower density. What we are looking to affirm through this ordinance is an ability though to preserve the units that we do have and ensure that there are multi-unit buildings that can be provided going forward.

I'll turn it over to Daniel, if he has anything to add from the Department of Housing in relation to this ordinance.

[Speaker 7] (3:25:31 - 3:32:13)
Sure, thank you, Patrick. And good afternoon, members of the committee. For the record, my name is Daniel Hertz.

I am the Director of Policy at the Department of Housing. I have just a few slides and a presentation, so I will bring that up now. So Patrick went through the zoning mechanisms of this ordinance.

I wanted to say just a few words from the Department of Housing's perspective about what we hope this ordinance will do and what problem we hope it addresses. So this really comes out of the department's longstanding concern, what we know is shared by many members of the committee, including the alderman and the affected areas and community members and others around the loss of two to four flat buildings, small scale multifamily buildings in Chicago. We know that these buildings make up more than a third of Chicago's housing stock and just as importantly are a major source of what's called naturally occurring affordable housing.

That is to say housing that has low or moderate rents, but that are not legally restricted and are not subsidized. And so we're vulnerable to being lost and as a neighborhood, gentrifies as property values increase. What we've seen is in particular in places where values are rapidly growing, that these buildings can often be torn down or deconverted through gut rehab into single family homes.

In fact, Chicago lost some 20,000 units in two to four unit buildings between 2010 and 2016. And this has been identified as a important issue in the city's five-year housing plan, reports from groups like the Institute for Housing Studies, the Council Latino Caucus and many other community stakeholders. In particular, in the 606 area in Pilsen that are affected by the ordinances in front of the committee today, we've been able to work with the Institute for Housing Studies that has provided preliminary data of their analysis of how many of these deconversions and loss of these units they've seen just in these areas.

So between 2013 and 2018, which is the most recent data that they have available at the moment, their preliminary data shows 25 deconversions in Pilsen and 59 deconversions in the 606 West of Western. And it's important that these numbers represent many more housing units, many more homes than just the number of buildings. If there's an average of three units per building, we're talking potentially about 75 rental units lost.

In Pilsen, 177 lost in the 606 area where this is even more advanced. And I think it's important that we see these ordinances as trying to stem a growing trend of this sort of loss of two to four flat buildings. We want to get this in place before this becomes even more widely held in these areas.

So this ordinance basically is adapting, as Patrick said, the zoning within the neighborhood context and policy priorities of the city. Historically, the emphasis with zoning has been preventing overly dense development. So mostly zoning has set a ceiling on density in Chicago and elsewhere.

But as I've said, we've increasingly realized over the last decade or so, that actually the loss of density in some neighborhoods is just as big of a problem and can create problems not just for affordable housing, but also things like school enrollment and reduced foot traffic to neighborhood retail districts. So essentially what this ordinance does is it recognizes that reality and it makes in these particular areas zoning restrictions symmetrical by creating both a ceiling, retaining the same ceiling that already existed, but also in some instances creating a floor and saying that zoning will also create a check on the ability to reduce density, reduce, take away these units and particularly two to four unit buildings.

The last thing that I just want to say is that the department is very proud to be moving this forward in partnership with DPD and with the aldermen and community groups that we've been working with. But we do want to acknowledge that this is one way we see to slow displacement of low and moderate income families. It's not a silver bullet, doesn't solve the problem entirely.

I do want to flag that we're working with aldermen, stakeholders and other city departments and intend to introduce a demolition fee as well in these areas. And I also want to just highlight some of the other approaches really quickly that we're taking to address displacement in these areas and in other parts of the city. So this includes things like the Chicago Community Land Trust, which was allocated $3 million from the Affordable Housing Opportunity Fund to acquire owner occupied housing and establish that as longterm or a quasi permanent affordable housing.

The Chicago Low Income Housing Trust Fund, which has expanded its portfolio by up to 500 units and is currently working to place those units around the city in particular in areas where displacement is a concern. Obviously the Affordable Requirements Ordinance, which requires affordability and many new construction multifamily market rate buildings. And the department is continuing to work on introducing a set of revisions to strengthen the ARO and get even more out of that ordinance.

And then of course the department's affordable multifamily development and preservation activities, building purpose built predominantly or even 100% affordable housing in these areas and other parts of the city. And with that, I'm happy to take any questions from the committee.

[Speaker 22] (3:32:19 - 3:32:19)
No.

[Speaker 1] (3:32:20 - 3:32:37)
Okay. I wanna, before we open to questions, I believe this is entirely in the 25th ward. So I'm gonna ask if he's on the call.

If he's on the call, Alderman Sito Lopez, would you like to comment on this? Byron? Byron?

[Speaker 16] (3:32:39 - 3:36:30)
Yes, chairman. And thank you to the housing department and DPD to working in collaboration with our office and our stakeholders. This is, as Daniel said, not a silver bullet, but a step in the right direction.

The huge issue of displacement that we have across the city, it is, I think that this is a step forward to changing the direction in which we were going from a huge landmark designation that would have made our community more expensive to an alternative that will give us the ability to discuss projects as they come in. So again, this conversion ordinance is not the silver bullet, but allows community members to have a discussion around zoning. They have a conversation about projects that come in the community.

And as the Department of Housing has identified, we have seen developers coming in and have little oversight in what comes into the community, losing naturally occurring affordable housing by the thousands. I wanna remind my colleagues in the zoning committee that we have lost because of the lack of action over 10,000 residents over the last 14,000, actually, over the last decade plus. So it is urgent that we start developing policies in coordination with our housing department, planning and our stakeholders so that we can allow our community to have public meetings, community meetings, as we revise the new projects.

We strongly believe that we can have development without displacement, but that will necessarily depend on the conversations that we're having. Not doing anything, not taking action, not having a conversation is not an option. We continue to see people leaving the city, but they're leaving because of lack of affordable housing and social services and things that we need to continue to discuss as a council with our communities locally.

I think that the conversion ordinance is a welcoming policy that can help us again address the issues that we have. This is not an imposition on property rights. Unfortunately, some people have said quite the contrary.

It is a discussion that must have. What we cannot afford is continue to have developers who come in without any checks and balances and have continued to erode the social fabric of our community. So again, this is a collaboration with all the stakeholders, a collaboration with the housing department, with policies that work.

Or zoning, just relevant to zoning, or zoning in Pilsen has a lot of mismatching. So policies like these are really hard to develop. So I wanna commend the housing department, Commissioner Navarro and her team for coming to our community, listening to what we discussed after the landmark discussion to give us the possibility to have conversations in our community.

I think that this opens the opportunity for us to have more dialogue, more collaboration and develop policies that can help us. I know that there are other policies that I heard this morning talking about the ADU demolition fees impacts, the ARO reform. There are others that I think that we continue to, that we must continue discussing, but I think that this is an opportunity for us to start the conversation, to stop the displacement, the massive displacement that goes with developers who pay little attention to the communities that they come in.

And I think that this will be a great step. I hope that the college support us in these efforts. And thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (3:36:31 - 3:36:39)
Thank you, Alderman. And we do have a couple of questions from committee members and we'll start with Alderman Kappelman.

[Speaker 34] (3:36:40 - 3:37:34)
Thank you so much. In many ways, I'm delighted by this because affordable housing, we're at a crisis like we've never seen before. I remarked about this before almost 50 years ago when I had my first apartment and I had a part-time job paying my way through school.

Even with a part-time job, my income was one 10th of my entire rent I could do. It was only $50 a month. So that's extraordinarily important.

I also think too that when we took our oath of office, we swore to uphold the US Constitution and there's been some discussion that this could be unconstitutional. So could I hear from the city's law department on the constitutionality of this proposed ordinance?

[Speaker 1] (3:37:35 - 3:37:44)
All right. James, we heard that in the public comment period also. So who do we have on from law that can answer this question?

[Speaker 23] (3:37:45 - 3:37:46)
Lisa Misherson.

[Speaker 1] (3:37:47 - 3:37:48)
Lisa, yes.

[Speaker 23] (3:37:48 - 3:38:01)
Hi, Alderman. Unfortunately, my video is not working, but I can answer that question, be happy to. Alderman Kappelman, are you speaking specifically about the deconversion part of this ordinance?

[Speaker 34] (3:38:02 - 3:38:03)
Any part of the ordinance.

[Speaker 23] (3:38:04 - 3:39:35)
Okay. Well, yes, we have reviewed at the law department and we feel very confident that it would pass any constitutional challenge. The minimum density portion of this is a legitimate land use regulation that would not be subject to strict scrutiny.

It's intended to promote the general welfare and address a problem that many in the community consider a very serious public health and welfare issue. So the minimum density aspect of this is no problem at all. The extension of the moratorium, we also feel would pass constitutional muster without any issues, mainly because the moratorium that's been in place has not been in place for very long.

This is a very short extension and this has been a difficult year to work essentially, because of the pandemic. So I think there would be some leeway in that direction as well. The purpose of the short extension is to meet with the community and other stakeholders about the proposed demolition fee.

[Speaker 1] (3:39:36 - 3:39:57)
And- Lisa, we're not talking about the 606 right now. I know that the land issues can be the same, but we're specifically talking about Pilsen and the similarity of the blocks have the two- Yes, yes, that's not a problem.

[Speaker 23] (3:39:57 - 3:40:11)
I'm sorry, we've sort of been thinking about the Pilsen and the 606 in concert- We'll get to that in a few minutes. Yeah, but no problem. This is a very straightforward and legitimate land use regulation.

[Speaker 1] (3:40:12 - 3:40:12)
All right.

[Speaker 34] (3:40:13 - 3:40:39)
One of my confusions about all this is I've talked to a owner of a three flat and he told me, which was hard for me to believe that his three flat is worth quite a bit more if it was converted to a single family home, which makes me think we're engaged in a taking. And I don't wanna enter that realm.

[Speaker 23] (3:40:40 - 3:41:33)
Yes, it would not be a taking. The government regulates land use in many ways that affect value from simple setback requirements to height requirements, even certain building code requirements. Many, many factors affect the value of property.

In this case, there would be a three factor test that would be applied to whether this is constitutional and economic impact would be taken into consideration, but the law does not guarantee the highest return on property value. So that's never the standard. And for simple land use regulation.

And in this case, there would be many, economically viable and profitable uses of the property would remain, even if they're not the most profitable.

[Speaker 1] (3:41:34 - 3:41:38)
All right, James, can I move to Alderman Ray Lopez?

[Speaker 34] (3:41:39 - 3:41:40)
Yes, thank you. Raymond.

[Speaker 6] (3:41:43 - 3:43:15)
Thank you, chairman and good afternoon members of the committee. I actually am glad that Alderman Kappelman brought it up because that was actually gonna be one of the first things that I brought up, which is the fact that contrary to Lisa's statement, I do believe this is regulatory taking of property as defined so often. I don't think that to simply say that this is just a land use issue when we've heard right now that this is a policy priority for this administration, for this department to force people who own multiple units to provide affordable housing, even if it is against their interest in creating a single unit residency on that same property.

That is taking, that is not just land use. And I'd like to know perhaps from zoning or whomever, what remedies do individuals have say in this area, in this district, should they still own a two flat or a three flat and follow that same example that Alderman Kappelman just gave where they choose to deconvert? Are they going to be stopped?

Are they going to be penalized through higher fees and application costs, things of that nature? How will they be able to move forward if they choose to disregard what this district says?

[Speaker 1] (3:43:16 - 3:43:53)
All right, I got the question. We've heard from Lisa in regards to the actual permit that would be buildings and zoning. So Patrick, do you wanna say if someone had a three flat and they come in for a permit to reduce the number if the preponderance of the block was multi-unit?

So what Alderman Lopez wants is the reality check as to when this hits either zoning or a building permit, which obviously zoning is the first step.

[Speaker 2] (3:43:54 - 3:44:38)
Yes, so I think the first thing to answer the Alderman's question is nothing in this ordinance prevents someone from seeking a zoning map amendment that lowers their zoning out of an RT4 district. So Alderman, for your example, if someone has an existing three flat, someone wants to buy that property, they no longer want to have a three flat in order, but the predominance of the block says multi-unit controls based on this ordinance, they would need to seek a zoning map amendment to remove themselves from an RT4, say to an RT3 and a half or an RS3, and then proceed with what they want to do. So as opposed to a zoning map amendment to increase your density, it would be a zoning map amendment to allow your decreased density.

[Speaker 6] (3:44:41 - 3:44:48)
And we're making an assumption that it's individuals who are moving in, but what if it's just a family that wants to do that?

[Speaker 2] (3:44:49 - 3:44:56)
It could be anyone, it could be someone who, no, it doesn't have to be someone who's new to the community. It could be someone who owns the property today, someone who occupied the property today.

[Speaker 6] (3:44:56 - 3:45:51)
And as of right now, if that were so, this is obviously a Pilsen district, but if there's a Brighton Park two flat owner who wanted to make it into a single family unit, their process would be very much different than what Pilsen two flat owner would be going through, correct? Right, this would only hold for the boundary that I had shown earlier, correct. So we are now, so what concerns me is that if you have individuals who own a two flat, I live in a two flat, you are now forcing people who may have not signed up for this, adding an undue burden onto them for what is everyone else's right throughout the city of Chicago, forcing them to actually provide housing or options for housing, even though they may not even want to be the defunct affordable housing provider for the city of Chicago.

[Speaker 2] (3:45:52 - 3:46:11)
Well, I would add that if they already have a two flat today, that two flat could remain and continue to function as a two flat. There is no requirement that they add a third or any additional units. So it can continue to operate as it is today.

Both accuracy and, oh, sorry, go ahead.

[Speaker 7] (3:46:11 - 3:46:46)
It's just Alderman, I was just going to quickly jump in and this is Daniel Hertz from the Department of Housing. I also just want to clarify, there's no requirement in this ordinance that units in these buildings be rented for any certain amount. So there's no legal restrictions on affordability, right?

I think what the department is coming from is that we know that this is a type of housing that often does provide moderate cost housing in many Chicago neighborhoods, but this is not forcing owners into an affordability agreement with the city at all.

[Speaker 6] (3:46:47 - 3:48:27)
Well, what you're forcing people to do is if they have a two flat, is that if they choose to make it a single family home, they're not going to be able to do it, even though as a property owner, it would be their right to do it everywhere else in the city of Chicago. What you're forcing people to do is to now live with a two flat that they will not rent. Because this assumption that these are affordable units that are accessible, which you just said 10 minutes ago as part of your policy for creating affordable housing, and now saying that there's no guarantee that people are going to use them for units anyway, then what need are we filling if there's no requirement to use them?

I mean, at the end of the day, this opens the door for starting to dictate to other neighborhoods that people are not in control of the properties they own, to go downwards, to make a single family home if they are so inclined to do so. And I think that sets a very dangerous precedent because even though we've discussed briefly at the beginning, the issues of constitutionality, I will say that in reading, even from like the, I just pulled up, like the Cato Institute says, you don't have to provide full enumeration. We know that.

But if you're still negatively impacting through regulation, you are doing a regulatory taking as defined by the Fifth Amendment. And I think you are overly confident in your assumption that you are going to pass constitutional muster. And I would hope this law gets challenged to its fullest.

Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (3:48:27 - 3:48:39)
Thank you, Alderman. I don't see other hands up questions or comments. So I'm gonna- Mr. Chairman, question. Alderman Hopkins.

[Speaker 14] (3:48:39 - 3:48:55)
Thank you. Can you provide examples of other jurisdictions where a residential zoning change is required in a residential district to change to a lower density use?

[Speaker 1] (3:48:55 - 3:48:58)
All right. That sounds like for Patrick.

[Speaker 2] (3:48:59 - 3:50:14)
So the unique thing that is in the zoning code today is that we don't have, as you advance to more dense residential districts, you do not lose the lower, the ability to provide lower density. So for instance, in the RM6 districts, you could still provide a single family home. And what we've been working on with the Alderman and with Department of Housing is looking at specific neighborhoods that have a lot of challenges now in maintaining density and maintaining a quantity of units and trying to use the zoning code and some of the provisions that are taking advantage of losing some of those units to require the units to remain.

And it's based on the context of those blocks. So we're looking at 50% plus more of what the predominance is of these blocks. And if they are multi-unit, then preserving the multi-unit ability going forward and making sure that that is preeminent in its importance in this purpose, in these neighborhoods in Pilsen, on these particular blocks.

So to answer your question shortly, Alderman Hopkins, as you move up, there is no prohibition on providing lesser density, but that's what this ordinance would institute for this geography.

[Speaker 14] (3:50:16 - 3:50:47)
Right, so looking around the country, what other municipality or city or town or village has a provision like this where you now have both a ceiling and a floor, and it's no longer assumed that in a residential district, if you're at maximum density by right, you can always go down. It's just a given, it's a ceiling, right? So where around the country is another example of this actually in practice today?

[Speaker 2] (3:50:49 - 3:51:31)
So there are another, Daniel may have some other information, but there are a number of municipalities over the last couple of years that have taken steps towards the elimination of single family homes, the lessening of minimum lot area allowed for units, all in an effort, collectively in an effort to increase density in urban areas. So this is not a unique approach. Well, I should say this is not a unique idea for the city of Chicago.

This may be a unique approach in how we're dealing with it in a very small geography, but there is a large trend throughout the country in looking at especially older urban cities that reduce the amount of requirements to allow low density.

[Speaker 1] (3:51:32 - 3:51:36)
I think Minneapolis is one right off the bat in my mind.

[Speaker 2] (3:51:36 - 3:51:41)
Well, yes, that's been the most pointed to, I guess you would say in the last couple of years, correct?

[Speaker 1] (3:51:41 - 3:51:42)
Daniel?

[Speaker 2] (3:51:42 - 3:52:28)
Yeah, I was going to jump in. Oh, sorry, oh, sorry. Let me just add one other thing.

In looking around at other cities, and we did this as part of the ADU ordinance, as well as this ordinance, which we've been working on for close to a year now, well before the pandemic, is one thing to note about the city of Chicago is that we have a different geographical structure compared to a lot of other cities. We have, you know, a lot of other cities have far larger zoning lots and, oops, sorry, and less density, again, within their urban centers compared to what we have. So we're dealing with already smaller lots and we're dealing with denser neighborhoods that we start with, which is different than some of the other cities that have been of note for this lately.

[Speaker 1] (3:52:29 - 3:52:41)
Yeah, and I'll just jump in, Daniel Hertz, again- Hopefully on this one, because we've still got the 606 and I know I've got a police and safety meeting shortly thereafter, so.

[Speaker 7] (3:52:41 - 3:53:05)
Okay, just very briefly to answer your question, Alderman. Seattle is one example of a city, a large municipality that has recently instituted essentially a floor in their zoning code. They did it in some targeted geographies, I think particularly around transit stations where they were trying to boost density within proximity to transit.

So that would be one other concrete example.

[Speaker 1] (3:53:06 - 3:53:14)
All right, I don't see any other hands up. So I would like to get a motion to move do pass on the ordinance, please.

[Speaker 20] (3:53:15 - 3:53:18)
Osterman moves do pass. Roll call, please, chairman.

[Speaker 1] (3:53:18 - 3:53:57)
Okay, so housing chairman Osterman moves do pass and Alderman Ray Lopez has asked for a roll call. So we will start with the roll. Everybody ready?

Got on mic? All right. Alderman.

Alderman. Okay, let me just reiterate. Voting yes means you're in favor of this ordinance and obviously voting no means you do not favor this ordinance.

So this is the density preservation ordinance in the 25th ward. All right. Alderman Hopkins.

[Speaker 12] (3:53:59 - 3:53:59)
No.

[Speaker 1] (3:54:01 - 3:54:14)
Alderman Dowell. Alderman Sawyer. Alderman Ray Lopez.

[Speaker 43] (3:54:15 - 3:54:15)
No.

[Speaker 1] (3:54:18 - 3:54:36)
Alderman David Moore. David Moore. Alderman Mike Rodriguez.

Aye. Alderman Sitio Lopez.

[Speaker 23] (3:54:37 - 3:54:38)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (3:54:39 - 3:54:43)

[Speaker 23] (3:54:43 - 3:54:44)
All right, Mike.

[Speaker 1] (3:54:45 - 3:54:50)
Also we have Sitio Lopez as an aye. Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 10] (3:54:52 - 3:54:53)
I support the Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (3:54:54 - 3:54:58)
All right, that's an aye. Alderman Roboyes.

[Speaker 58] (3:54:58 - 3:55:00)
Aye, support the Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (3:55:02 - 3:55:12)
Alderman Cardona. Felix. Let me get back to him.

Alderman Waguespack.

[Speaker 43] (3:55:15 - 3:55:15)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (3:55:17 - 3:55:39)
Alderman Kerry Austin. Aye. Alderman Villegas.

Aye. Alderman Riley. Alderman Capelman.

[Speaker 6] (3:55:39 - 3:55:40)
No.

[Speaker 1] (3:55:45 - 3:55:46)
Alderman Osterman.

[Speaker 46] (3:55:46 - 3:55:47)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (3:55:48 - 3:55:49)
Alderman Hadden.

[Speaker 46] (3:55:50 - 3:55:51)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (3:55:56 - 3:55:58)
Oh, Alderman Beal.

[Speaker 5] (3:56:00 - 3:56:02)
How could you forget me, Mr. Chairman?

[Speaker 47] (3:56:02 - 3:56:03)
Oh, I know.

[Speaker 1] (3:56:03 - 3:56:06)
You know how much I care about you, Tony.

[Speaker 10] (3:56:06 - 3:56:07)
I support the Alderman.

[Speaker 47] (3:56:07 - 3:56:08)
All right.

[Speaker 5] (3:56:08 - 3:56:09)
Weren't y'all together yesterday?

[Speaker 10] (3:56:11 - 3:56:12)
This is public safety.

[Speaker 1] (3:56:13 - 3:57:31)
All right. And then Chairman Tony is an aye. All right, let's get the numbers.

All right, 11 yays and three nays. All right, and those nays would be Alderman Lopez, Alderman Hopkins and Alderman Capelman, correct? Okay, all right.

So the ordinance passes and we refer to the full city council. Okay, next item. We're gonna stay on this topic.

Okay, so next we have document number 02020-6206, a mayoral amendment modifying municipal code chapters 17.2 and 17.7, residential zoning district uses and standards and establishing the predominance of the block that's in the 606 district, as well as a brief extension of the 606 demolition moratorium. My understanding, we have a substitute on the matter and you should have received it electronically. I'm gonna ask Alderman Roboyas moves to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections on that substitute?

[Speaker 24] (3:57:32 - 3:57:34)
I'll move, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (3:57:34 - 3:57:54)
All right, any objections? Okay, hearing none, we have the substitute in front of us. We have probably the same Patrick Murphy and Daniel Gertz to discuss this two phased ordinance.

[Speaker 23] (3:57:55 - 3:57:55)
Patrick.

[Speaker 2] (3:57:56 - 4:03:26)
Yes, Chairman, thank you again. So again, my name is Patrick Murphy and I'm joined here with Daniel Hertz from the Department of Housing. And as you noted, there is a substitute ordinance for the 606 provisions that we're discussing now.

And specifically this substitute further relaxes the control percentages, which were in the original ordinance as it relates to multi-unit buildings in RT 3.5 zoning districts. And we're expanding the impacted boundary from California further East to Western. I'll get through the specifics on these percentages as well as get maps up related to the boundaries here shortly.

But much like we just discussed on Pilsen, in the area around the 606, I'll be at different zoning districts, which I will get into. In this case, it's an RS 3 and the RT 3.5. This proposal will prevent the establishment of single family homes when a majority of the block is lawfully improved otherwise. I'll go through the slideshow here in a second to explain the impacts of this and also to show some visual representations of blocks again in this neighborhood.

Okay, so for instance, we have blocks existing around the 606 of which I'll get to images to show real life conditions that have a variety of improvements. And in these instances, we're dealing with either the creation of a two flat or the creation of a single family home. One key difference in this community as opposed to Pilsen is the zoning around the 606 is less dense.

It requires less density or allows for less density than what you can find in the RT 4 zoning districts around Pilsen. So this ordinance had to be tailored specifically to the zoning that exists in this community. As far as what we're specifically talking about, it encompasses four wards.

However, I will note that there are currently no residentially zoned properties in the 36 ward. And as you can see of the residentially zoned properties, an overwhelming amount of them are currently zoned RS3. And that is our most relaxed, our least intense single family home district.

It allows for a single family home to be provided on the smallest zoning lot and also allows for the creation in specific circumstances of two flats. And that specific rule, which I'll go back here to the front, is what we use as the basis for this ordinance. So if you look at the top of this slide, we currently have a rule today that if a block of a block face is improved with 60% or more of multi-unit buildings, then there is an allowed reduction in MLA that can allow for a two flat to be established in an RS3 district.

Going forward, we look at various blocks around the 606 and have created an inverse of that rule, whereby if a block is improved with multi-unit structures in an RS3, that's 50% plus one, then a multi-unit building is what could be provided. It's the same logic that we use around the Pilsen district, but it's just tailored, like I was saying, to the different zoning that is in this neighborhood. So in this example, 1700 block of North Tolman in the first ward, 23 properties exist on the block face, 13 of them are existing single family homes.

And so this would be eligible for a single family home construction. Moving to the 3500 block of West McLean, 26 ward, 14 properties here, the predominance is multi-unit. So a multi-unit building is what would be allowed to be provided within this boundary on this block.

1800 block of North Keeler, 22 properties, a majority being single family homes, and therefore a single family home is what would be eligible for construction or improvement here if it were a vacant lot. And like I said before, the 36th ward does not currently have any residentially zoned property. However, it was previously included in the boundaries of which this is mirroring around the 606 from earlier moratorium discussions.

I will turn this back over to Daniel, but I would wanna add one other thing. I did reference the RT three and a half zoning district. As you can see on this map, there are currently very few parcels.

There are a couple in the 26th ward around Albany and Whipple, just north of North Avenue, as well as some a little bit further east in the first ward. If the property is zoned RT three and a half, we are lowering that threshold from 50% to 40% to be the controlling percentage. And that's really a twofold reason.

One is because the RT three and a half district is the first district that starts to allow a wider variety of multi-unit properties. You can get to three unit properties, plus you have lower MLA requirements. And because it has a structure to it from a zoning standpoint that allows for multi-units, we worked with the Alderman, specifically the three impacted Alderman to lower the percentage from 50% to 40% to encourage or provide a means that's easier to maintain density on these blocks.

And I'll turn it over to Daniel, and I can certainly answer questions about this ordinance after Daniel is finished.

[Speaker 7] (4:03:30 - 4:04:05)
Hi Alderman, this is Daniel Hertz, again, Director of Policy, Department of Housing. I think my comments on the previous ordinance hold fully for this one as well. The only addition I would say is, this ordinance also includes the eight week extension of the moratorium during which as we said, the department intends to work with affected Alderman and community stakeholders, as well as other city departments on the introduction of a demolition fee component of addressing displacement in this area.

[Speaker 1] (4:04:06 - 4:04:26)
Okay, all right, Daniel. We have, I know some of the affected Alderman that are on the call. And I just, before we get to them, the substitute Patrick, what was literally in the substitute was the moratorium extension?

[Speaker 2] (4:04:27 - 4:04:43)
No, there were, well, from a zoning standpoint, there was a change in the boundary. We used to only go to California. Okay, and we adjusted the percentages as it relates to the RT three and a half district.

And then correct, there is moratorium portions. Yes, you are correct sir.

[Speaker 1] (4:04:43 - 4:05:05)
Okay, so there were three parts. All right, so let me just see, we have none of the, I think none of the members are committee members. So I will go out of committee and I'll start with Alderman Ramirez-Rosa.

[Speaker 13] (4:05:06 - 4:08:41)
Thank you so much, Chairman Tony, and thank you to the zoning committee members for your time today. Last term, leaders with the Lowman Square Neighborhood Association and residents facing rising rents and housing costs near the 606 Bloomingdale Trail began organizing to address displacement in their neighborhood. Their organizing was rooted in their personal experiences as they saw families pushed out, local businesses closed and school enrollment declined.

The experience of these residents was corroborated by research conducted by the DePaul Institute for Housing Studies that found that the loss of affordable two and four flats was a serious issue in the 606 area that necessitated a government response. In 2015, in response to this displacement near the 606, loss of affordability and the resegregation of our community, LS&A leaders and residents began to take action. They organized, they knocked doors, they talked to neighbors, they did research, collected data, and they wrote an ordinance.

Their efforts and that ordinance submitted last term, their, apologies, their efforts and that ordinance submitted last term are what led to this minimum density ordinance today. Thanks to LS&A and community efforts, one year ago, we came together and between the mayor's office and local aldermen, we compromised to institute a demolition moratorium near the 606 to protect those two and four flats. At that time, we said it was a temporary fix to work towards a long-term solution.

This ordinance today is part of that long-term solution. I'm proud to sponsor this minimum density anti-deconversion ordinance alongside the mayor and Alderman LaSpada because it will help preserve our two and three flats and the affordability and diversity of our neighborhoods. But it's important to note that the minimum density ordinance for a portion of Logan Square-Nevosa near the 606 trail is just one component of our strategy to preserve neighborhood character and affordability.

Minimum density must be coupled with a demolition impact fee in Chicago neighborhoods where multifamily residential housing predominates. A demolition impact fee is critical to help curb climate change and mitigate demolitions environmental impact while helping to preserve the existing affordable two and three and four flats. Minimum density alone could promote demolition of existing multifamily housing and exacerbate that displacement.

That is why the 606 minimum density ordinance before your committee today, this substitute includes a two month extension of the area of demolition moratorium. This final extension will allow us to finalize the demolition impact fee. And I'm so pleased that we were able to get to this compromise.

We are so very close to finalizing the demolition impact fee. Thank you to everyone in the departments of planning and development, housing, law and intergovernmental affairs who have helped us get this far with crafting the solution to address displacement near the 606 trail. And a big thank you to the leaders at Logan Square Neighborhood Association who first initiated the grassroots campaign to address displacement near the 606.

I credit their consistent organizing as the reason why the community input my office has received on this matter has been overwhelmingly positive and in support of taking these reasonable actions to address displacement in our neighborhoods. 50 years from now, future Chicagoans will judge us on our housing policy by their outcomes. Will the housing policies we institute today work to address displacement or will they reify segregation?

We need to recognize that it will take the whole host of government policies and interventions working in tandem to ensure Chicago has the racially and economically integrated communities we all want to see. We are taking steps towards helping to ensure Chicago has integrated in diverse communities, but we must do more. This is just one first step, but it has my support, my community support, and I ask the committee to support this measure so that it can take effect in a portion of my board.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (4:08:41 - 4:08:53)
Thank you, Alderman. And Alderman LaSpada, you want to add to that and not reiterate from the beginning? I will not reiterate, sir.

[Speaker 19] (4:08:53 - 4:11:37)
I will make my best effort to be additive, but yeah, I'm really pleased to stand as a co-sponsor and supporter of this ordinance in part because I was there in 2017 when my predecessor, when community organizations like LS&A started the fight to curb demolitions and the loss of housing in this area, I was standing with youth leaders in 2018 on the one year anniversary of that fight. I was with them marching along the Bloomingdale Trail on the second anniversary of that struggle. And now we're here four years after the challenge began of trying to address the loss of housing along the 606 area.

And I'm glad that we've been able to work with zoning, with housing, with DPD, and with, thankfully, gratefully, the mayor's administration on the first of what I believe will be several tools to maintain the integrity and the diversity of this part of our community. I also want to address the concern that came up during public comment related to public process. Not only did we hold several public meetings related to this over the last year and a half, but from February 2020 to July 2020, we had four open legislative ward nights, both online and in person, for people to learn about this process, the research we were doing, the policies we were advocating for.

Numerous other residents were met with individually or as a group. Mr. Colgan, who commented at the beginning about the lack of meetings, actually requested a meeting from us that we granted for him and other residents who were concerned. And unfortunately, he was the only one to not show up at that meeting.

But I want you to know, committee members, that we have tried to make our process around crafting this legislation as inclusive as possible to really preserve a diversity of housing stock, to really preserve a diversity of housing options in our community, to not say what you must do with your property, how you should rent it, but to recognize that the zoning decisions that we make have 25, 50, 75 year impacts. And that in preserving two to three housing in a rational, reasonable way, we are preserving the diversity of this community, both in its housing stock and its residents for decades to come.

[Speaker 1] (4:11:37 - 4:11:40)
And so- Thank you. Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 19] (4:11:40 - 4:11:41)
Thank you for your support.

[Speaker 1] (4:11:41 - 4:12:38)
I appreciate it. And the rest of our committee members appreciate it too. Our public safety meeting will commence immediately after this.

So we've got, I don't see hands up for this particular one, but I'm gonna need a motion to move to pass. Motion do pass. As amended.

And that motion move to pass as amended, again, is by Alderman Osterman. And all those in favor of the motion? Aye.

Aye. Aye. Any opposed to the motion?

Okay, the ayes have it. And it will be reported out to the council tomorrow. Was that someone's hand up or what?

[Speaker 23] (4:12:39 - 4:12:45)
This is Lucia. I'm just clarifying that that motion was by the same roll call as was- Oh, yes, I'm sorry.

[Speaker 1] (4:12:45 - 4:12:55)
Motion by the same roll call that was used to establish quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, so moved.

Passed as amended.

[Speaker 56] (4:12:55 - 4:12:55)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (4:12:55 - 4:13:52)
Thanks for the detail, Lucia. All right, I've got a few more things there and they are landmark fee waivers and signs. So bear with me.

We have five landmark fee waivers. I'll read them all together and take a motion all at the end. In the first ward located at 1441 North Milwaukee Avenue.

In the second ward located at 2146 West Pierce Avenue. In the ninth ward located at 11345 South Forestville Avenue. In the 39th ward located at 5801 North Pulaski Road.

And lastly, in the 43rd ward located at 560 West Fullerton. Any questions by committee members? Can I get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 58] (4:13:52 - 4:13:54)
So moved by Alderman David Moore.

[Speaker 1] (4:13:54 - 4:15:15)
Alderman David Moore moves to pass on the items. Any objections? Hearing none, the items are passed.

Lastly, we have large signs over a hundred square feet in area 24 feet above grade. We will hear them all together. I will read the ward followed by the address and take a motion at the end.

Starting in the 14th ward, one sign at 4343 South Pulaski Road. Also in the 14th ward, four signs located at 4000 West 40th Street. In the 14th ward again, two signs located at 3507 West 51st Street.

Moving on to the 20th ward, 1138 West 48th Street. Also in the 20th ward, two signs located at 1129 West 47th Street. Moving on to the 28th ward, three signs located at 1520 West Harrison Street.

In the 44th ward, 2902 North Clark Street. Also in the 44th ward, 3700 North Clark Street. And lastly, in the 47th ward, 3407 North Kalina Street.

If there are no questions by committee members, do I hear a motion move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine form?

[Speaker 5] (4:15:16 - 4:15:17)
So moved.

[Speaker 1] (4:15:17 - 4:15:31)
Alderman Beall moves to pass. Any objections to that motion? Hearing none, the items are passed.

And thank you for your patience. That concludes today's meeting. Can I get a motion to adjourn?

[Speaker 3] (4:15:32 - 4:15:34)
So moved, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (4:15:34 - 4:15:48)
Alderman Rodriguez makes that motion to adjourn. Any objections? Hearing none, the meeting is adjourned.

And I believe the public safety meeting will commence shortly. Thank you.

[Speaker 51] (4:15:52 - 4:15:54)
We- I sure can. Start the live stream.

[Speaker 4] (4:15:55 - 4:15:55)
Okay.

[Speaker 25] (4:15:56 - 4:15:56)
Sorry, thank you.

[Speaker 34] (4:16:14 - 4:16:15)
Yes, Chairman, we're good to go. Thank you.

[Speaker 4] (4:16:23 - 4:17:16)

Also, our witnesses will be allowed to give an opening statement. Let's keep our opening statement as brief as possible. But what I mean by brief is approximately three to five minutes each.

And I do see a hand raised, Alderman Irving.

[Speaker 50] (4:21:21 - 4:21:26)
Yeah, Mr. Chairman, I just want it to be recorded for purposes of the quorum and attendance.

[Speaker 4] (4:21:30 - 4:21:54)
Alderman Irving is present. We do have all members of the committee that are present. If there's a point of information or point of order or point of clarification, please state so by stating your name so that you can be identified for the record.

Alderman Curtis, I have you present as well so that you could be identified for the record. And with that being said, I believe that Alderman Jason Irving- Can I ask a question, Mr. Chairman?

[Speaker 42] (4:21:54 - 4:21:56)
Can I ask a question?

[Speaker 4] (4:21:56 - 4:21:59)
I have my hand raised. Point of information, Alderman Sposato.

[Speaker 42] (4:21:59 - 4:22:05)
It's not a point of information. You named a bunch of people, but we don't know who they are.

[Speaker 4] (4:22:06 - 4:22:10)
Are they gonna be lost? Yeah, if they wish to and I'll call on them.

[Speaker 42] (4:22:10 - 4:22:11)
Identify themselves or are they just here?

[Speaker 4] (4:22:12 - 4:22:49)
No, they're gonna be providing witness statements as well. And I will identify them when we get to that portion and they will be able to inform you who they are. Okay, thank you.

Thank you. Alderman Jason Irving, I believe has a substitute ordinance before the committee. Can I get a motion to accept Alderman Irving's substitute by the same roll call as was applied to determine a quorum?

So moved, Alderman Scott. So moved by Alderman Scott. There are no objections, so Alderman Irving, can you go ahead and proceed if you have any statements regarding your substitute?

[Speaker 50] (4:22:49 - 4:24:14)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, working with Alderman Beal and members of the administration, we have been able to solve some of the challenges that have been raised earlier with earlier questions. As you will see, the substitute as drafted does a few things. Number one, it gives the destruction superintendent to take the necessary steps to work with this project has been called a cop house in the fifth district.

Subject to a couple of things. Number one is the sponsor of the budget and employee pilot program for a two year period, identification of a funding source vetted and acceptable to the superintendent and budget director and a funding stream as to the amount and duration. Also, there will need to be a passage of an appropriating and ensuring the continuity of the funds.

And again, and it's also to function as a remote caps office, which I believe meets all of the requirements and everything that not only the community wanted, the Alderman wanted, but also the police department wanted. So I would ask that after question and conversation that we pass the substitute ordinance as presented here for us today. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 4] (4:24:15 - 4:24:55)
Thank you, Alderman Irving. If I could ask all of my colleagues to please mute your mics at this time so that we can give our witnesses an opportunity to speak. We will start with Ms. Andrea Reed. Ms. Reed, have you joined us today? Mr. Thomas McMahan, Ms. Sheila Stevenson.

[Speaker 33] (4:24:59 - 4:25:01)
Hello, can everybody hear me?

[Speaker 4] (4:25:01 - 4:25:05)
I can hear you, Ms. Stevenson. Go ahead and proceed. You have about three minutes, Ms. Stevenson.

[Speaker 33] (4:25:05 - 4:27:35)
Okay, I wanna say good afternoon and thank you for the opportunity to be able to speak. I have been a resident of the Roseland area for the last 50 plus years, and I've had the privilege of being a project manager for the special service area in Roseland. I was on your call Friday and was listening to the comments and concerns and the issues that played in the community.

Which brings me back to the point of being able to say that I think that the cop house that the alderman is trying to put or would like to put in place is an excellent idea because being booted on the ground, I find that there has been a wall built with the community and the police, basically us versus them. And with that being said, that's a lose-lose for everybody. Where there was a time when we would have different things like the Chicago field, the public school field house, the church house, everybody had something to do with our neighborhood and our community.

And I'm finding that with that cop house is a way for everyone to win-win with the cop house being a place where youth can come in and have a safe place to be, have a safe place to come and learn. A lot of times these homes and places are an escape for our young people that need some type of refuge from their day-to-day activity with their family. And the only way that we can thrive as a community and bridging the gap between the community and the police is to have a relationship.

Relationships are very strong. And we just need it in order to have a safe place for our children to be. And I'm just asking that we just try to come together to make this a personal place for everyone to come for our community organizations to be able to come in and teach our kids, build the relationship between the police department and our community.

And I thank you for this opportunity.

[Speaker 4] (4:27:36 - 4:27:39)
Thank you, Ms. Stevenson. Regina Hightower.

[Speaker 33] (4:27:39 - 4:27:42)
Oh, hey dad. Hello?

[Speaker 4] (4:27:43 - 4:27:44)
Ms. Hightower?

[Speaker 37] (4:27:44 - 4:27:45)
Yes, can you hear me?

[Speaker 4] (4:27:45 - 4:27:46)
I can hear you.

[Speaker 37] (4:27:46 - 4:29:25)
Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Yes, my name is Regina Hightower and I actually worked for the police department for 30 years. I served as a detective in area South, which encompasses the fifth district.

And I also worked as a CAPS and beat Sergeant in the fifth district. I've seen firsthand the need for a cop house and it can serve for a multitude of things for the residents and not only as the residents, but the police for the fifth district. It can be a safe place for children to play or somewhere where children can come do their homework.

It could actually serve as a place where if a crime victim or witness wants to meet with a detective or a police officer concerning their case, they can meet there at the cop house because maybe they don't feel that the police station is a safe place to meet. It could also serve as a place for the community to come together and organize simply because when communities are plagued by issues that are affecting their quality of life, they need somewhere to assemble, somewhere where they can feel that not only is their voice being heard, but also that they feel that they can connect with the police. So in closing, I would just like to say that the cop house can be established as the root and serve as a building block to beginning to bridge the gap between the community and the police.

And I would just like to thank Alderman Beal for allowing me as a retired Sergeant of Chicago Police Department to come in and speak on behalf with regards to this cop house. Thank you.

[Speaker 4] (4:29:26 - 4:29:31)
Thank you, Ms. Hightower. And we have Eli Washington, Mr. Washington.

[Speaker 57] (4:29:32 - 4:29:33)
Good afternoon.

[Speaker 4] (4:29:33 - 4:29:34)
Good afternoon, sir.

[Speaker 57] (4:29:35 - 4:30:26)
My name is Eli Washington, Chairman of Chesterfield Community Council. Daniel Burnham said, make no little plans. They have no magic to stir men's blood and probably themselves will not be realized.

Two years ago, Alderman Beal invited myself and a group of community leaders to a presentation on the concept of the cop house. The concept of a police substation of the service and redeveloping an abandoned property was very well received by all the attendants. It is my belief that a new approach to crime reduction and community policing is desperately needed in these times.

This concept, if approved, should be duplicated, especially in the 6th District, 3rd District, 7th District, 15th District, and 4th and 1st Police Districts. Milwaukee, Wisconsin made a bold plan and Chicago should also. Thank you for the opportunity to address this distinguished body.

[Speaker 4] (4:30:27 - 4:30:37)
Thank you, Mr. Washington. And we are trying to get Mrs. Andrea Reed on, but let's go ahead and proceed with a command to Angel Novalis.

[Speaker 5] (4:30:38 - 4:30:39)
Mr. Chairman, you do have Tom McMahon on.

[Speaker 4] (4:30:40 - 4:30:45)
I do, Mr. McMahon, Mr. Thomas McMahon.

[Speaker 24] (4:30:46 - 4:30:49)
Here, yes, I am here. Can you hear me, sir?

[Speaker 4] (4:30:49 - 4:30:51)
I can hear you, Mr. McMahon. Go ahead and proceed. Thank you.

[Speaker 24] (4:30:52 - 4:34:03)
Thank you for allowing me to address this group. I appreciate that. My name's Tom McMahon and I'm a retired captain of the Chicago Police Department.

37 years of service to the residents of this city, but I've been a resident of the 9th Ward for close to 40 years. After my retirement, I stayed very active with the CAPS program and I served as the DAC chair for the 5th District for a number of years. I'd like to talk to you a little bit.

What is the COP House? Well, it's really a new strategy and it's not meant to take over CAPS. It's meant to supplement, to augment the CAPS program.

Its purpose, build relationships with community, improve quality of life in that neighborhood, empower citizens, reduce crime and build trust. What is the cost to the city when the citizens lose trust in its police department? This can start building trust back into our neighborhoods.

I've been involved in this program, the CAP House program for the last two years. I've been at meetings with Superintendent Johnson. He embraced it.

He thought it was a wonderful idea. Superintendent, acting Superintendent Beck, again, thought this was a great idea and was trying to move forward at the time. I understand that there was a meeting with Superintendent Brown and he felt strongly that he felt he was going to send some of the command personnel to Racine, Wisconsin to see how it's done up there.

So I don't know if that was ever undertaken at this time. There is this issue that I've read about in the paper that there's this longstanding policy that restricts CPD's ability to enter into a contractual relationship with third parties. Say, let's get rid of that.

We can overcome that. We're Chicago. We're the Chicago Police Department.

We're the city of Chicago. That's not an obstacle, that's a detail and details can be worked out. It worked out in a small city like Racine, Wisconsin, where this is a mainstay of their community policing program.

By the way, they report a 70% decrease in crime in the areas where this was developed, where this cop houses were deployed. Last week at a previous meeting of this committee, Alderman Burnett said that his constituents would like to see a police station on every block. Well, this is not a police station on every block.

It's much more. It's a community center, an information center, a safe haven. Other governmental agencies can do community outreach.

It will anchor the neighborhood. It will reach stakeholders that are traditionally not involved in the CAPS meeting. It will create dialogue and it will build trust.

So whatever the obstacles are, let's move forward on this and let's make those obstacle details. Look at the support you have from the community, from the business community. Everybody wants this.

Let's move forward and get this done. Thank you very much. I appreciate the ability to appreciate your time and thank you for allowing me to address this committee.

[Speaker 4] (4:34:03 - 4:34:08)
Thank you, Mr. McMahon. I believe Andrea Reed has joined us. Ms. Reed.

[Speaker 38] (4:34:08 - 4:34:09)
Thank you.

[Speaker 4] (4:34:09 - 4:34:10)
Thank you.

[Speaker 38] (4:34:11 - 4:36:36)
Am I, okay, I got muted. Roseland is a community that has been grossly overlooked for many years. However, due to the Invest Southwest, quality of life planning and other economic development initiatives, Roseland is well on its way to overcoming many of the obstacles that have reset us for many years.

According to an article published by the US Department of Justice entitled, importance of police community relationships, it states, strong relationships of mutual trust between police agencies and the communities they serve are critical to maintaining public safety and effective policing. Police officials rely on the cooperation of community members to provide information about crime in their neighborhoods and to work with the police to devise solutions to crime and disorder problems. Similarly, community members' willingness to trust the police depends on whether they believe that police actions reflect community values and incorporate the principles of procedural justice and legitimacy.

Due to the civil unrest that have occurred all over the United States, it is time to rebuild positive relationships throughout every community. COVID-19 has put a major strain on our society outside of the massive number of people who have perished. It has caused many businesses to lay off and or shut down.

This is creating a great sense of anxiety, a rash of robberies, carjackings, and we have yet to see what's next as it relates to public safety. Years ago, when I was in the mortgage industry, we promoted grants and discounted fees to police officers for the officer next door program. Studies show that when there is a police officer in the community who is socially responsible to the community, crime decreased significantly.

People need to see police officers as their neighbor and friend. The cop house in Roseland will help us to clear our streets of the open market blatant activities that continue to hinder economic growth and improve the quality of life in a community that is desperately in need of revitalization. Thank you for your time.

[Speaker 4] (4:36:37 - 4:36:40)
Thank you, Ms. Reed. Commander Angel Novalis.

[Speaker 1] (4:36:45 - 4:37:16)
Hi, how are you doing? My name is Commander Angel Novalis. I'm the commander of the Office of Community Policing.

I wanted to thank the Witnesses Hightower, Washington, Captain McMahon, who I was fortunate enough to work for, and Joy Reed, and if I missed anybody, my apologies. I am going to defer to Commander Eric Wingstrom, who will be driving this meeting. I will intermittently chime in to ensure that anything that deals with caps that I could supplement, I will be more than happy to do so and answer those questions.

Eric, I defer to you.

[Speaker 4] (4:37:17 - 4:37:20)
Thank you, Commander. Commander Winstrom.

[Speaker 41] (4:37:22 - 4:39:11)
Chairman Calafiero, members of the Committee on Public Safety, thank you for the invitation to be here today. The Chicago Police Department welcomes ideas to increase public safety and strengthen police community relations. We appreciate and share a willingness to seek out creative ways to reduce crime in Chicago.

As with any potential CPD program, the Cop House proposal should be thoroughly examined for funding, staffing, safety, and liability implications, as well as ensuring it is the right fit for Chicago. As the superintendent set out in his letter, the Chicago Police Department believes the best approach to community policing is not always a static site, but rather seeking out opportunities for officers to meet the community where they are. Embracing this idea, the Police Department implemented the Neighborhood Policing Initiative in five districts across the city, and as of yesterday, began training 22 more district coordination officers to be assigned in the fourth and fifth police districts.

The Neighborhood Policing Initiative provides a valuable relationship-building tool, problem-solving mechanism, and strategy to better address crime prevention. Importantly, the Neighborhood Policing Initiative allows officers to meet members of the community where they are, such as churches, schools, or field houses. CPD has a number of questions about the specifics of the proposal.

Specifically, we need more information to evaluate the feasibility, including information about costs, sustainability, and security measures to protect our officers, civilians, and equipment. We understand the Alderman has established a funding source. Our vital questions are what is the cost to the city?

Will our officers be safe in this building? Are there potential conflicts of interest? How long will funds be provided, and under what circumstances?

In light of the concerns I've described, CPD is pleased to learn that there will be a substitute order, which will both provide for and require additional review of this proposal. We are supportive of the substitute order and look forward to continuing to work with Alderman Beal to explore this initiative.

[Speaker 4] (4:39:12 - 4:39:17)
Thank you, Commander. And I believe we have Jeff Levine from the Law Department.

[Speaker 21] (4:39:20 - 4:39:36)
Yes, good afternoon. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. I don't have any prepared statements, but I'm happy to answer any questions if they arise.

[Speaker 4] (4:39:36 - 4:40:01)
Thank you, Jeff. We do have questions and comments. If there are any additional of my colleagues or committee members or council members, please use the raise your hand function off to your right so that you can be recognized.

Our first speaker is Chairman Michelle Smith. Chairman Smith. Chairman Smith?

[Speaker 46] (4:40:02 - 4:41:39)
Yes, I'm sorry. I was, I, excuse me, Mr. Chair. Yes, I had been first raising my hand because I did not get a chance to see the substitute.

And so I wanna thank the sponsor of the substitute for putting a path out there because I really have a lot of, I have a lot of questions about this. My experience has been that when a private enterprise or people or a foundation are willing to fund something, usually those people become part of the conversation pretty early on. So since it looks like that we're all comfortable with this idea, I look forward to hearing about that and finding out what the, finding out really what the deal would be.

And also interested in finding out from the police what they think. I admit that I have concerns about this concept because to me it can possibly create more danger for our police officers and our citizens, but maybe I'm wrong. You know, there's been a lot of talk over the years about how police stations are designed and the current design of police stations is designed to have more glass and be much more open.

But I agree that with the witnesses from the police that if it's the right thing to do and it can be funded and the right questions are asked and everyone is safe that we should certainly look into it. So I just wanted to say that. And thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 4] (4:41:39 - 4:41:45)
I don't have any further questions. Thank you, Chairman. Alderman Derek Curtis followed by Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 14] (4:41:45 - 4:41:50)
Mr. Chairman, please add Alderman Hopkins to the roll. Thank you. Thank you, Alderman Hopkins.

[Speaker 55] (4:41:52 - 4:42:28)
All right, thanks to me and Chairman. This question is for my colleague, Alderman Beal. I know back in the day we used to have what was called satellite offices in the neighborhoods and they were great.

This proposal, they were office spaces. So, and I know in this proposal, cop house would even maybe even in the middle of a block. Will it be set up the same way, same thing?

[Speaker 5] (4:42:29 - 4:42:38)
Well, if I could, Mr. Chairman, if I could go through the cop house from beginning to end and I might answer some of your questions. Alderman Curtis.

[Speaker 4] (4:42:39 - 4:42:43)
Yes, sir. Yeah, the chair recognizes Alderman Beal.

[Speaker 5] (4:42:44 - 4:49:24)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, this is a project that I have been working on for over two years. I have had over four in-person meetings with superintendents, former superintendents and all the top brass and briefed them thoroughly on this cop house concept.

In each one of those meetings, from the first deputy to the superintendents, Eddie Johnson, Charlie Beck, to first deputy Carter, I mean, Fred Waller, former first deputy, all of them embraced it as a wonderful idea. And so we were moving forward with implementing this cop house. We had a piece of property under contract on the worst block in my ward in order to implement this program.

Since then, we've lost that contract on that house. It was sold to another private owner. But since then, five people have been shot and two have been killed in or around that house that we had under contract.

So we know our wards, our commanders know our wards and their districts. And so to go to the heart of the problems in my area is what we were attempting to do. We have a private funder that's committing $250,000 to implement this cop house.

And I will tell you, if this passes this committee and if it passes city council tomorrow, I will disclose the funder right after city council meeting or Mr. Chairman, right after you finish your report of reporting this out. My funder has asked me not to disclose who they are until the city embraces this program as a pilot. There are five cop houses in Racine, Wisconsin.

Since the inception of the concept of the cop house, since then over 70% reduction in crime in or around Racine, Wisconsin. Now we know Racine, Wisconsin is not comparable exactly to the city of Chicago, but we can craft our cop house to formulate the city of Chicago and hopefully we can have some of the same results that they have. Now I'm willing to work with the superintendent.

I'm willing to work with my CAPS office. I'm willing to work with my commanders. I'm willing to work with the mayor because if this is successful, the city is successful.

We all know we're dealing with carjackings all over the place. We know we're dealing with murders all over the place. This is an opportunity to build a cop house in the heart of a problem area to start building confidence and relationships back between the police and the citizens.

Now the cop house itself will be redeveloped, purchased, redeveloped, and totally rehabbed by a private entity. And then we will get into a sublease or some type of agreement with the police department to where they have access to go in and out of the cop house. Now what will the cop house entail?

Well, if you have the officers going in and out of it, and I also have a commitment from Sheriff Dart to put his resources in or around the cop house, each room can have its own feel. It can be a reading room. It can be a arcade room.

It can be a computer room. It can be a tutoring room to have the communities to start going in, interacting with the police department. And that builds trust from the ground up.

Now Ford Motor Company has also basically giving a donation of a car to each cop house. Now the car is different. It has a different feel to it because when the car goes down the community, it's still a police vehicle, but it is identified as a different vehicle and it's identified as the cop house vehicle.

Now the superintendent and the mayor launched an initiative a couple of months ago saying that we need to get the officers out into the community, engaging with the people, doing cleanups and things like that. Well, this is exactly what this will do. It will put the police officers in the community.

And so when you look at what this 250,000 will get us, it will save lives. It will bring resources. And the block that we're looking at, we will bring all the city wraparound services along with it.

The department of housing, the department of buildings to where we can start rehabbing, maybe doing some infill housing. And we take that block back from the ground up. Now, the beauty of this particular program is once the problem have subsided, once the problems go away, you can sell that house to a low income residents who will now get a freshly rehab, renovated piece of property at a very low, reasonable price.

And then you can take the proceeds from that sale, move the cop house to another area and do the same thing all over again. Because we all know problems move from block to block, community to community. Well, we can move the cop house just the same.

And so I'm excited about having this pilot program. I'm excited about the fact that out of the 15 problem communities in the city of Chicago, Roseland is the only one out of the 15 that has showed a 33% reduction in crime. The only one, because we've been able to create jobs and opportunity in the community.

We've been able to come up with new ideas, creative, innovative ways to reduce crime, engaging the people. And this is just another tool that we have in the toolbox because if we can reduce 33%, maybe we can go to 40, maybe we can go to 45%. And that's all of our goals.

Now, most of you all that I've talked to on this committee, and if I hadn't gotten to everybody, I'm sorry, but it's been a very busy week and weekend. But everybody that I've talked to says, I want a cop house in my ward. I would like to have the same concept.

Well, let's start today. Let's start this pilot program. And if it works, we all win.

If it doesn't work, well, you know what? We gave it a darn good try. And I just ask you all to work with me on helping my community as we move forward.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 4] (4:49:25 - 4:49:30)
Thank you, Alderman Beal. Alderman Curtis, go ahead and continue. Well, first, did that answer your question?

[Speaker 55] (4:49:31 - 4:50:09)
Absolutely. That answered my question, and I'm excited for you. I'm only mad because we're not...

And I pray that this works, because not only do I want one in my district, I would love to have one in my ward. So congratulations. You know, you've been working on this for the last two years.

I think it's a great idea, especially when we try to reach back and establish relationships with the public. That was my only question, and I'm excited for you.

[Speaker 4] (4:50:10 - 4:50:16)
Thank you, Alderman Curtis. Thank you. Alderman Lopez, followed by Chairman Sposato.

Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 6] (4:50:18 - 4:51:25)
Thank you, Chairman. Good afternoon, members of the committee. Thank you, everyone who's here.

I too wish to join in support of this order. I think it's long overdue, and I want to say that everything that Alderman Beal has vocalized today is true. When police and community can work together, great things are possible.

What is unfortunate is the fact that politics and pettiness nearly derailed this effort to save lives in Roseland. That is unacceptable. It should not take an order from the city council to get police and aldermen to work together to protect people.

And I hope if anything else positive comes out of today, it is that this police department and superintendent need to work more specifically with aldermen to address local issues without being forced to do so by the entire city council. That is shameful. That is a disgrace to our city, and it is not who we are as Chicago.

Thank you.

[Speaker 4] (4:51:26 - 4:51:36)
Thank you, Alderman Lopez. Chairman Sposato, followed by Alderman Thompson. Chairman Sposato.

Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 42] (4:51:36 - 4:52:19)
Thank you very much. Alderman Beal, kudos to you for sticking this out and staying the course for two years. I didn't know you had this in the makings for two years, so I'm very impressed.

You kept trying and you stuck with it. I do have a couple of questions and I'm not sure who could answer. Maybe it's for Alderman Beal, I'm really not sure.

So I think one thing was answered, I guess we're talking about possibly being a community center. So it'd be a multi-purpose place, because I was just originally thinking the idea just for the police to come in there and do their work and meet with people. So it's basically almost like a community center above and beyond meeting with people in the community.

[Speaker 5] (4:52:21 - 4:52:51)
Absolutely, that's exactly what it is. As well as we're gonna work with Kaboom, because one of the concepts that they have in Racine, Wisconsin, is they also have numerous play lots and playgrounds just adjacent or right across the street from the cop house that's also under surveillance from the police department. Because we're gonna put cameras in or around the house.

And if there's a play lot, we put cameras in or around that play out as well, because we just wanna make sure that the kids stay safe at all times.

[Speaker 42] (4:52:52 - 4:52:59)
Okay, so are we looking at a 24 seven place, Alderman? Or are we just looking like a nine to five place?

[Speaker 5] (4:52:59 - 4:53:52)
Well, more than likely, it'll be about 16 hours a day at the most. It's not a 24 hour facility, it will be closed at night. But at the same time, it will be under alarm and surveillance with cameras and things like that.

And we'll work through the logistics. I know some of the police officers have a concern about the equipment. We don't see any equipment being left in, no valuable police equipment being left in the facility.

One of the things they do in Racine, Wisconsin is they leave their police bikes in the facility or in the cop house. And then that way, if it's a very nice day, instead of driving the car around, they can opt to just get on the bike and ride their bike around and patrol the area as well. So it's whatever we want it to be.

And so we wanna meet with the community and meet with the police department and come up exactly what the concept will look like here in the city of Chicago.

[Speaker 42] (4:53:53 - 4:54:13)
Okay, thank you. So I know we talked about 250,000, that's basically to buy the building and then to rehab it, correct? Correct.

And then who's gonna pay for the people to be working in there? Or is somebody gonna like manage it? Are we gonna have like an administrator or something?

Is that the idea?

[Speaker 5] (4:54:13 - 4:55:49)
No, sir. Basically what happens is the developer will still maintain ownership of the property. The developer will be responsible for all the upkeep, snow removal, grass cutting, garbage, things like that.

That will still be on the developer. And right now with the 250,000, we feel that we have adequate resources to at least pay the utilities and all the upkeep for a substantial amount of time. But let me just say, the five cop houses that are in Racine, Wisconsin are funded by the same developer, I mean, by the same funder.

And they're able to also get federal resources as well to offset some of the programs and things like that that go in. But I just wanna assure everybody, there's no city money going into this at all. It won't affect the police department's budget or resources.

We just need, you know, basically the CAP's office to go in there, the CAP officers to go in and out of there. And then we bring the programs in with it as well as the sheriff office. Tom Dart said he would also bring his resources to go in and out of it as well.

And if you have a problem block, if you have that many officers going in and out of a house on that particular block, and say first, if the officers wanna have lunch somewhere, comfortable, they don't have to go to the district. They can cope, they can get their lunch or they can go to the cop house, which will have a microwave, oven, a stove and things like that. They can go to the cop house and just have their lunch.

The presence alone is gonna be a deterrent for crime in that particular area.

[Speaker 42] (4:55:51 - 4:56:31)
Okay, great, great, great. So then just one last thing, and I don't think it's for you Alderman, I don't know, it's for Jeff or one of the commanders maybe. So obviously you're probably gonna have, you know, 49 other Aldermen say this is, if we do this, they'd like to try and figure out some way to get one in their ward.

So basically it's, we could potentially, and I didn't see the ordinance yet, but basically it will be up to me or me, meaning any Alderman to find funding to put one in their own ward, I would suspect. I don't know who can answer that, one of the commanders or Jeff.

[Speaker 41] (4:56:33 - 4:56:52)
I'll try to speak to that Chairman Sposato. That was just that that was a concern, scalability city-wide was a concern of the superintendent and funding. And once we get details on the funding of this, maybe that will answer some of the superintendent's questions as far as scalability city-wide.

[Speaker 42] (4:56:53 - 4:57:01)
Okay, all right. Thank you very much everybody. Chairman, that's all I have to say.

My questions are answered. Thank you everybody.

[Speaker 4] (4:57:02 - 4:57:11)
Thank you Chairman Sposato. I believe we have Alderman Thompson, followed by Alderman Napolitano. Alderman Thompson.

Thank you, Chair.

[Speaker 12] (4:57:12 - 4:58:03)
I too want to just echo and commend my colleague from the ninth ward for his creativity here and hard work he's done to secure the financing. And this idea, I think it's, it sounds like a great program and hopefully we can wrap this up this week. You mentioned Boom, a great partner.

We had a play lot at the Barbara Jean Wright built by Kaboom and they're fantastic. And forget the kitchen, the microwave. If you can just bring that great old fashioned glazed donut restaurant and bring those around to the top house, I think that'll be better than the kitchen.

So I just want to wish you best luck and I know we'll work through the details and look forward to continuing to do great things down in the ninth ward.

[Speaker 4] (4:58:03 - 4:58:12)
Thanks, Chair. Thank you, Alderman Thompson. Alderman Napolitano followed by Chairman Burnett.

Alderman Napolitano.

[Speaker 48] (4:58:13 - 4:59:57)
Thank you, Chairman. Can you hear me? I can.

All right, thank you, Chairman. I appreciate the opportunity to talk and as well, thank you to my colleagues and all the panels, people on the panel today. To Alderman Beal, great job, sir.

If you look at the numbers between last year and this year, just people shot alone in the city of Chicago were hitting the mark of almost 4,400 people. Homicides are astronomical between last year and this year. But for you to take the time to think out of the box of how to create a safer environment for your ward, your neighborhoods, I cheer you for that.

I cheer you on. I'd like to see if possible, sir, if you could even roll this maybe into the old fashioned teen centers that we used to see throughout the city and maybe connecting a lot more with the kids in there with the officers as well and creating those relationships at an earlier age would be a great benefit, I think, to this as well. And I also think too, sir, for this cause that you created, or I'm sorry, this opportunity that you've created, the success of it, I think, will help.

You'll be helped with donations from your community and your neighborhood and as well as the city of Chicago towards that cop house to keep the electric running and keep everything that you need to maintain that house. I'm sure this is going to be a success. Congratulations, I would love to see this throughout the entire city.

Anytime we're creating more hubs or locations where our officers can go and the neighborhood can go to feel safe, you gotta champion it. You thought outside the box. So God bless that and I appreciate all you're doing.

And thank you, Chairman. I appreciate the opportunity to talk.

[Speaker 4] (4:59:57 - 5:00:07)
Thank you, Alderman Napolitano. Our next one, our honorary member, Chairman Walter Burnett followed by Chairman Zedlowski-Garza, Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 10] (5:00:07 - 5:01:29)
Fantastic, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I wanna commend Alderman Bill. Fantastic thinking out of the box, Alderman.

You know, this reminds me when we used to have the CHA police and we used to have the CHA police in all the buildings, right? And you know, those buildings are like being on several blocks. And when we put CHA police in the buildings in the community, it brought crime down substantially in those neighborhoods.

And to me, that's just like this or very similar. I think it's worth a try. I think we need to track any and everything we can to make the police feel safe.

But also helping to build that relationship with the polices in our community. I don't know why we won't use public funds to pay for it. I tell you, I'm willing to use my menu money if you put one of those in my ward right now.

And I'm serious because, you know, over in the West Humboldt Park and 11th District, we need one on every corner. You know, so I commend you for this. Moving on, I pray that everything goes okay.

And I pray that we adopt this idea throughout the city of Chicago.

[Speaker 4] (5:01:29 - 5:01:36)
Congratulations to you, man. Thank you, good job. Thank you, Chairman Burnett.

Chairman Sadlowski-Garza.

[Speaker 11] (5:01:37 - 5:01:38)
Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 9] (5:01:38 - 5:02:21)
I just wanna commend my colleague for this innovative and collaborative idea. This is what true community policing is, right? Bridging that gap between the community and the police.

I envision, you know, you said, you know, police can go there and have their lunch or their dinner. You know, isn't it a great concept to maybe they can have their lunch and their dinner with some teenagers, you know, on the block? Or, you know, it's all about relationship building, right?

Wonderful idea, fantastic concept. I wish you nothing but the best. And you have my support on this.

Amazing, amazing project. Congratulations.

[Speaker 58] (5:02:22 - 5:02:22)
Thank you.

[Speaker 4] (5:02:23 - 5:05:06)
Thank you, Chairman Sadlowski-Garza. And Alderman Bill, let me also congratulate you. And I, you know, you and I have spoken about this.

I think it was last Thursday. And I told you that my office sits directly across the street from Oak Park. And Oak Park operates somewhat of a cop house.

I believe they call them satellite offices where their residents can go in and not only do police reports, but they could also receive city services. And it's been successful, at least from what I've seen. They do have two that I'm aware of in Oak Park.

And I've done my research on the cop houses that are in Milwaukee. I think we have to continue to push the envelope. If we are talking about reducing crime across the board in the city of Chicago, one of the things that I continue to talk about when it comes down to violence reduction, if we keep doing the same thing over and over and over again, we are never going to see the decreases in crime that we'd all like to see so that our residents can enjoy a good quality of life.

Particularly on the West side and on the South side. We all deserve that throughout this entire city. But as you've seen, and as you know, crimes have spiked on the West side and South side.

So I want to thank you for this innovative idea, but most important, I want to thank you for working with the police department, the administration, and also members of the caucus to make sure that we have something that can be successful. You've said it plainly and very clearly, if this is successful, then the city is successful. If this can prevent one shooting, if it can prevent one death, then I would consider it a success because that's a life lived and that's a life that can be changed or whatever, or promises made by that particular person.

But I do believe that if this is successful, we all will be successful. And we all will be looking for innovative ways to bring a reduction of crime in our own individual wards. And I thank you for making sure that it's in the order that the public chairman of public safety would get the first crack outside of the ninth ward.

I say that jokingly, but I want to thank you for it. I don't know who Galaxy S10, but they do have their hand up. It looks like- Okay, Alderman Gardner.

[Speaker 15] (5:05:06 - 5:05:35)
Yes, chairman. Thank you. One, I'd like to be accounted for on a roll, but more importantly, I just wanted to commend my colleague, Alderman Beal, for once again, like many of my colleagues has already said, for thinking outside of the box.

Anything we can do to make our city better, I am all for it. I know as many other people are, and I would like to co-sponsor this order as well. So thank you again, Alderman Beal.

[Speaker 4] (5:05:36 - 5:05:44)
Thank you, Alderman Gardner. There being no further questions- Soyum was do pass. Okay, we have a motion by Alderman Soyum, do pass.

[Speaker 21] (5:05:46 - 5:05:56)
Chairman, and as a procedural matter, can I suggest having that motion be passed by the same roll call used to establish quorum?

[Speaker 4] (5:05:58 - 5:06:32)
Thank you, thank you, Jeff. And procedurally, can we have Alderman motions? I'm sorry, Alderman Sawyer's motion on the substitute be it passed by the same roll call vote as was applied to determine a quorum?

No, no move. So moved by Alderman, so moved by Alderman Sawyer. Hearing no objections, so ordered.

Congratulations again, Alderman Beal. This matter will be reported out at the city council's meeting, the next city council meeting on January 27th, 2021. There being no further business before the committee, the committee on public safety is hereby adjourned.

[Speaker 6] (5:06:33 - 5:06:34)
Alderman Lopez moves to adjourn.

[Speaker 4] (5:06:35 - 5:06:38)
Thank you, Alderman Lopez, so moved. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee.

[Speaker 43] (5:06:40 - 5:06:42)
Congratulations. Thank you. Congratulations.
