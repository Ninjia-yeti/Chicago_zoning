[Speaker 18] (22:39 - 24:16)
mr chairman appreciate the opportunity to speak my name is john shagrew um i've been a chicago attorney for almost 30 years now i'm here on behalf of the business owner seeking to reopen a banquet hall at 62 44 to 50 west 63rd street and the 13th ward that it was had effectively been closed since covid in 2020 i'm here in opposition to the request to rezone the property from b32 to rs2 the business owner mr filimon ramirez has an exemplary business record in the city of chicago through his past ownership of several grocery stores on the southwest side and his current operation of two banquet halls also on the southwest side the property in question operated as a banquet hall for 45 years it had the proper zoning designation and exceeds the parking requirements established in the zoning code there was no request or need for any sort of special use zoning change variance or exception he's had no issue in the past receiving both liquor and food licenses from the city of chicago he started the rehab work on this property with an electrical permit and has a full permit application pending with the city with the building department based on the recommendations of the field inspectors as a business owner he had every indication and right to expect that he would be able to open this business without an issue changing the zoning effectively leaves a vacant unmarketable property and denies the property owner and the business owner any opportunity to recoup their investment at this point all we're asking for is the zoning to remain in place so the permit can issue the final closing could take place with the seller so she is made whole the buyer can bring the remodeling to a point where the property is marketable and sell it to another business owner who can present its concept to the alderman and the community rs2 will only create a stalemate

[Speaker 1] (24:17 - 24:33)
thank you thank you uh next up we have uh to juan sims taiwan excuse me so today i'm here to ask that

[Speaker 20] (24:34 - 26:08)
uh location at 45 south 103rd street the imperial hotel be closed down um it is part of the roseland if anything zoning locations and i was shot there august 24 2023 i was shot because of one of the employees and two or two other employees was involved in it there were no arrests made which makes me assume that maybe what mr blake moore says is right that if you have some sort of capital in this city then you are above the law and i hate to believe that especially since i'm a father i was just proprietor in the place for a few weeks um had a misunderstanding with the owner mr chanti um patel if that's his name um however there was none arrests made no follow-ups and actually i think it's been swept under the rug but it's good that i'm here today to speak about this hopefully the alderman's hopefully that the higher-ups can follow up with this having this place shut down it's in a busy thoroughfare and if you're willing to shoot a patron then you're willing to shoot anybody or have anybody shot and murdered i'm lucky that i did survive that incident however there was no follow-up and though it's in the far south side it should be shut down the location is once again 45 45 west 103rd street located and uh name of the place is the imperial hotel please follow up please shut it down it does not need to be there thank you

[Speaker 1] (26:10 - 26:25)
thank you sir uh next up i have uh pert gifford good morning um i'm here to speak uh about a

[Speaker 8] (26:25 - 29:25)
matter that was deferred at the previous meeting it's not on today's agenda but it's on mine it's also accompanied by a petition which is in front of the committee here signed by 85 people living within a 250 foot radius of a proposed development at 3301 the 3305 west division all have signed in opposition to the zoning change the signers are owners tenants and representatives of single family homes two flats condominiums apartment buildings and vacant lots 50 parcels are represented by this petition there are only about 100 parcels within the radius of the proposed development over 25 of those are owned by affordable housing corporations 50 parcels represents a majority of private property stakeholders in the radius who oppose a zoning change the proposed project is inappropriate at almost twice the height of anything in the radius and inadequate due to the lack of on-site parking our community has a decades-long history of supporting appropriately sized and scaled affordable housing developments as proof there stands 100 affordable apartments located within the radius of the proposed development site this includes 65 units at 1152 north christiana operated by lucha the largest corporate apartment owner in that radius as additional proof several vacant lots are slated for development as affordable housing many of us commute to work by car we rely on street parking which is already in high demand after working all day to pay rising rents and to pay our property taxes which just doubled we need to be able to park our vehicles quickly to return to our families and to the comforts of home if the zoning change is allowed 100 new bedrooms of residents with only 14 on-site parking spaces will be built the disparity between the high number of residents and the low amount of parking is not good for this location its impact on this community would be detrimental by design a zoning change would be a departure from community standards in direct opposition to the needs and wishes of the stakeholders these standards were established in the 1990s when humboldt park began its legacy as host to the highest concentration of affordable housing in any neighborhood in the city of chicago there are no million dollar homes within the radius of the proposed development we support affordable housing even though statistics prove we already have our fair share a structure built to current zoning requirements would be welcomed if the zoning change is approved this project will hurt working people please maintain the current zoning please deny the zoning change for 3301 to 3315 west division and deny special treatment to the developers and to others who do not live here thank you thank you mr gilbert i

[Speaker 1] (29:25 - 29:52)
understand the next few speakers are on the same item did you both still want to speak great um then uh yes senor ramos and elida cruz jose quinones okay great you both have three minutes good go right ahead again just to be clear so this item is not on the agenda uh i don't know if it's set for a future meeting but it will be posted if it is recalled yes proceed hi everyone my name

[Speaker 10] (29:52 - 32:36)
is jessenia ramos and i'm here for the zoning i propose the proposed construction at 3301 through 3315 west edition will take place directly across from my building this is my building this is the proposed location that would be my view a six-story view i am concerned at the height of the proposed construction the number of units and inadequate parking being planned by the developers there are 40 multi-bedroom units placed in only 14 parking spaces what uh what about the commercial what about the commercial space plan on the first floor what are the workers and the the customers going to park every sunday i watched a large covered parking lot underneath the current structure this one here filled up with church goers there are 30 cars that park underneath that space every sunday also about winter parking restriction and division it's parking bans it's a short-sighted to allowed structure of the size to be built with so few parking spaces this is going to create big headaches for current residents and rise the cost of living for many who will be forced to find off-street parking the height of the proposed structure is also a problem not only will it literally cast my property into a daylight shadow during the winter months but it would also be out of character with all the other existing structures in the area the height of the the next-door neighbors live and subsidize two units is what i've heard called scatter site housing the units are brick there's yards for children to play and tenants to grill like my house the two-story building please do not approve a zoning change for this property please consider the the existing residents when making your decision we do not ask for much on the west side but we are asking for a normal size building to be built night a monstrosity which will diminish the quality of life we keep we will keep the decision in mind when you

[Speaker 1] (32:36 - 32:49)
cast our votes thank you thank you uh and then uh alita cruz i'm old enough i gotta use these

[Speaker 6] (32:49 - 35:53)
glasses excuse me um but i'm gonna just kind of just i've got a couple points here real quick um first of all i've lived in the neighborhood since i was nine and you guys can do the math i've been there 52 years um and as a resident of that community i we worked tirelessly to improve the area when we talk about habitat uh habitat uh company when they came in to do all the scattered site housing our community actually worked with them to not only reduce the numbers but to also ensure that the type of buildings that they were putting in were going to fit into the facade of our community one of the reasons that we did that is because we wanted to maintain the beauty of our community we wanted to maintain whatever land landmark statuses we may even have so it fit right in number two we felt that the number the number of units were also going to be we're going to exceed what our community area could support we saw everything that happened on the east side of the park we did not want that to happen on the west side of the park where so many of our homeowners were still living there were living there and are living there and they continue to support this community area we also fought for um uh the liquor sales to be abolished in that precinct that took that that that was a dynamic uh opposition for us or we had to we actually had to go two cycles two election cycles before we we were successful at getting that done and i can tell you vicar dykes families that lived complete across the street from it i had families actually come up to me and say thank you because now my children had come outside they were fearful for what was happening there and i also want to remind the rest of this this committee that less than two years ago in that very corner there was a shooting where a couple were killed right after a parade and that's without the number of the concentration putting this building up aside from it not fitting into the facade 40 families would not have the ability to actually live a life of as miss ramos said where the where the least scattered site housing they have a they have a yard where they can play and whatever they can grill they can still have and 40 families can't do that in a large high rise anyone who lives in a high rise knows that if there's not a community center or a community room they can't even have parties so that just would not be feasible for the families and you continue to you would continue to display i have always been a a a proponent of home ownership i would like to bring this to the developers that rather than making these rentals to make them affordable units for own home ownership it would give these people a viability and vested interest in our community

[Speaker 1] (35:53 - 37:42)
thank you thank you very much um uh there being no other speakers uh we'll move on to the agenda first item is document number 0 2024-0007733 amendment of the municipal code section 17-6-0403-f by requiring special use approval for sports and recreation permits in specific use categories in a pmd 4a located in the 27th ward this item was introduced by vice mayor burnett who i think just stepped away so we will uh come back to it um next item uh we're going to defer uh all the person puentes makes a motion i'm sorry i need to read that all right the next item in the agenda is document number oh 2023-000628 in the fourth ward introduced 12 13 23 amendment of municipal sec code section 17-4-0404 regarding mla reduction for downtown floor area bonus um again alderman riley makes a motion to defer the previous red item by the same roll call that was used to determine forum any objections hearing none the item is deferred next up we have a historic landmark designation document number oh 2023-0007798 in the 30th ward introduced 2 15 24 we have from dpd eilish tuffy thank you vice

you a change in zoning to the vacant new warsaw restaurant and banquets property located at 6250 west 63rd street i've held this ordinance in committee for several months to allow the community to weigh in on the plans for the site this request for zoning change comes directly from 13th ward residents who have decided a new banquet hall is not the right is not right for the community it's important to note that i have not offered any persuasive arguments for against this proposal it's worth stepping back to better understand how we got to this point and how the community nearly had no say in the significant development construction began in october of 2023 with absolutely no notice to me or the 13th ward community the owner of the property and his attorney did not introduce themselves to the community they did not alert anyone to their plans they simply began to work residents had no idea what was planned for the site and had heard it may become a nightclub it may become a migrant shelter it may become a strip club residents raised concerns about the project at the caps b812 regular meeting in october upon hearing this i filed an ordinance to change the zoning last november the attorney from the project john segrew asked me that i hold the ordinance in committee which i did under the condition that he present his proposal to the community at the regular caps meeting um at the regular a12 caps meeting he agreed and the meeting took place on february 14th of this year residents still had questions and concerns and as at the result of the february 14th meeting an additional meeting was scheduled as a follow-up attorney john segrew asked me again that i hold the ordinance and committee which i did under the condition that he present at a second meeting he agreed and at the meeting was the meeting was held on tuesday march 5 the community voted on the plans for the site at the march 5 meeting and voted against the banquet hall proposal our job as alders is to protect residents interests and preserve their collective community voice had i not filed this ordinance the community would have been steamrolled i demanded the community meetings be held because my singular motivation is to preserve the community's voice i believe the process that i set forth was open and fair the meetings were community-led in coordination with the chicago police department and the cap speed a12 the police and caps participated asked questions but also did not offer any persuasive arguments for against the development many community members attended both meetings in person and both meetings were also live streamed for the community the southwest news herald wrote three separate stories about the process my office posted on social media daily about the meetings and included full agenda and voting process for the march 5 meeting all residents who did not agree with the proposal were asked to sign the petition and the packet distributed by the committee chair uh are several exhibits including the meeting agenda for march 5 side petitions by those who oppose the proposal a letter from jason huff with the police district council and several newspaper articles thank you mr chairman thank you alderman

those ends we are here today seeking a type one zoning map amendment with related administrative adjustment relief pursuant to section 1713 0303d of the chicago zoning ordinance in order to permit the construction and occupancy of a new four-story eight unit all residential building at the subject site um the building will feature a total of two four-bedroom units and six three-bedroom units as well as on-site enclosed parking for eight vehicles um we've been working really closely with alderman martin and the residents of the neighborhood and towards that end there has been a need that has arisen in this area for affordable housing that's more family oriented and not only that but is for sale and private ownership as opposed to rental so in consideration of this application and proposal we have been working with the chicago housing trust and are going to be providing one of the eight units as a voluntary affordable housing unit and it will be again one of those larger family units um towards those very same ends the related administrative adjustment relief that we are seeking for the record is an increase in the minimum allowable parking ratio for a transit served location and that's from 50 that is required for transit served locations up to 100 again these are larger units and it has been relayed to us by the community that one-to-one parking is very important um similarly we are on a substance significantly substandard site so um due to the orientation of the improvements we were unable to provide eight on-site code compliant bicycle parking storage spaces um so we are also asking for an administrative adjustment to reduce the minimum required bike parking from eight to two with that in mind however there will be internal bikes storage within the basement of the building for eight bicycles it's just not strictly code compliant um and then lastly again the site is only 106 feet deep which is 19 feet shorter than a standard city lot and therefore we do require also um a reduction a slight reduction in the rear setback of not more than 50 percent and that's from 30 feet to 21 feet um as i indicated we have been working with alderman martin and he did provide a letter of support with the attached affordable commitments so with that i just very respectfully um request the support of this honorable committee thank you miss barns um

[Speaker 1] (53:41 - 54:19)
we do have a letter of support from alderman martin um i want to just for committee members if you've noticed on the agenda we've started to list whether the type one applications are also combining with an administrative adjustment or a variation and i think the attorneys will list off what those requests are when they present we've chosen not to list them on the agenda just to not have a lot of extra stuff there but we always have that if uh if possible um before i go to questions from committee members i think we're all curious about affordable home ownership in a neighborhood especially if we're on the north side right yeah um could you talk to us a little bit more about the chicago housing trust and how that process has been working so far yeah no it's

[Speaker 3] (54:19 - 55:35)
been wonderful um so the chicago housing trust is um been working with the department of housing on projects where um the affordable requirements ordinance is not necessarily triggered but to provide these types of affordable housing opportunities to the areas especially in the city that are underserved with affordable housing and like i indicated especially when it comes to for sale um private ownership units and less dense buildings so three flats six flats eight flats um they've been wonderful with which to work um essentially they will help to make the developer whole um so that they can get the financing that's necessary so for this project we're doing an 80 percent ami um and then you work with the housing trust towards certain other compensations and subsidies to help make up for that 20 gap in development costs so it's been really great and wonderful and if any of the committee members or chairman would like um direct contact information with um the department of housing or the housing trust i'm happy to

[Speaker 1] (55:35 - 56:39)
provide that to you we'll go ahead and email that to everybody i don't think there's a member that isn't interested yeah by their website any other questions by uh committee members did i ask the one that we want to have nope um hearing none all they're going to let's spot our moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine forum any objection hearing none the item is passed as substituted probably with substitute narrative plans thank you thank you next uh bottom of page three is document number two two three six seven dash t one in the first ward ordinance referred to 1524 common address is 1441 west cortez street change request is rs3 residential single unit detached house district to be two three neighborhood mixed-use district can i just ask folks um in the gallery if if you are having conversations to take them outside or keep it down just a little bit it's getting a little loud in here thank you all right mr acosta good morning mr chairman

members of the committee this is one of those situations uh we see all over the city where uh there appears to be a quote-unquote vacant lot but it's not a buildable lot because it's been used historically with the building next door in this case the building next door is a four unit it actually was a traditional three flat and it did take advantage of the adu so it is four units now uh but if and the purpose here just is to split the lot and create a buildable lot next door uh for a as of right uh three unit but in order to do that we need to make the existing building compliant and there is a bay that comes out near the what will be the new lot line so um a part of our type one request is to also have a variance to reduce the east side yard of the existing 1408 building and once that's done to split the lot and uh with that we had a series of community meetings and um made some changes and uh eventually got the support of the 47th ward committee and um would and have a letter from the alderman and would request your

[Speaker 7] (1:28:10 - 1:31:12)
members of the committee my name is liz butler i'm a partner at the law firm of taft stettinius and hollister located at 111 east wacker drive in chicago our firm represents the applicant in this matter 3652 rightwood property llc an affiliate of land and sea department i'm joined today by by pete tolson the co-founder of land and sea the applicant is requesting a rezoning of the subject property at 3652 west rightwood avenue from the b12 neighborhood shopping district to the c11 neighborhood commercial district in order to establish a hair salon with massage services in the existing commercial building at the property the property is located at the corner of west rightwood and north lawndale and is improved with a currently vacant single-story commercial building the applicant will renovate the existing building with interior work to demise the space into two tenant spaces two new windows and doors will be added window openings will be expanded and the existing masonry will be preserved cleaned and repaired as needed the salon will take the eastern tenant space which is approximately 2400 square feet the salon will offer typical haircut color styling services retail sale of hair care products facials body waxing massage services so there will be four private rooms for massage the change request to the c11 is necessary because while hair salons are either a permitted or special use in the b12 district massage services are not a permitted use in the b1 district so changing to the c1 allows both the salon and the massage services as a permitted use the rezoning will facilitate the reactivation of this vacant commercial building by facilitating its transformation into an active vibrant space that aligns with the character of the surrounding neighborhood the proposed salon operator is a local long-standing chicago business that will be an amenity to the neighborhood the applicant discussed the proposal with the 35th ward and participated in the 35th ward community driven zoning review process the applicant and its team met with the logan with logan square preservation who conditioned their support of the change on the applicant seeking the c11 instead of the c12 district and as a result we changed our proposal to go to the c11 instead of the dash two we understand that the alderman um the alderman ramirez rosa has indicated his support uh of the change to this committee in advance of the hearing and i i believe he may be joining um the hearing remotely and may have his own remarks um that he might he might share uh so we thank the committee for its consideration of this matter and respectfully request your favorable recommendation of the proposal and we're available to answer any

[Speaker 15] (1:32:20 - 1:34:15)
district we have to present attorney daniel rubino thank you yes my name is daniel rubino r-u-b-i-n-o-w attorneys this oh i also have uh dr muhammad aldabani who represents the owner of the building and the applicant and also katie koslowski who is one of the architects on this project uh this is 2519 north halsted we're looking to change the zoning from b1-2 to b3-3 this location has been or had been uh blue chicago for many decades uh went out of business and the several years dr aldabani has a very soft spot in his heart for this location first of all he owns similar facilities out of state but he also used to frequent this as a young man in med school what he'd like to do is revitalize and renew the building and had several violations and fell into disrepair and when the building became available he purchased it in 2023 with the intention again of revitalizing the building opening a restaurant with incidental activity not a tavern and a ppa and there will also be two apartments on floor two and three because this is such an old building with continuous ownership and licensing the zoning had changed quite a bit this is not a type one by the way for a venue this size for a ppa it needs to be up zoned to b3 so we applied we've had meetings with the alderman for close to a year we met with the park west neighborhood association as well as other neighborhood people in the neighborhood who are interested they are all very excited and enthusiastic about this and i believe you have letters of recommendation from the alderman at least and so we ask for the board's

approval great great thank you we do have a letter of support from alderman knutson

yeah and uh chairman i'm on if it's okay if i say a few words please do thanks can you you can hear me okay yes we can great okay yeah so we um uh started talking to dr aldobani about this project i mean gosh what was it 10 months ago now and it was before he purchased the property and to the point of the building falling into disrepair about a week after we talked and again he was not the owner of the property at the time a dead tree on the property fell through the garage and we this this is a beautiful facade very near our 43rd ward office so we couldn't be more thrilled for it to get this kind of investment from dr aldobani just to even uphold what we believe is a historic structure he's going to be preserving the sign too that brings a lot of nostalgia into people who have spent time at the historic blues bar last week we had a community meeting at lincoln park presbyterian and there was a pretty good crowd there for a community meeting related to this type of zoning but it was all in support and interest there were people who read that dr aldobani was hoping to invest in this property and bring it back to life and really just wanted to come out to express their support and learn more about the doctor's plans so we couldn't be more in support of this project our neighborhood association here the park west neighborhood association also is in strong support and we look forward to um you know helping on anything we can throughout the construction process great

[Speaker 26] (1:38:19 - 1:39:16)
you mr chairman uh very uh briefly um these are properties that happen to be located uh near washtenaw between harrison and polk uh in in my opinion they were misclassified as improperties when these are flat in fact two flat buildings uh one of the residents was trying to do something with the property and it was not allowed under the code but when you looked at it it's it's really improperly zoned uh the predominant zoning in the area is what we're changing it to which would be in compliance with everything else that's on the balance of the block with the exception of the corner lots which have the m designation as some of them still have uh active businesses going on them some of those parcels are vacant we left those along washtenaw the same as the m zone that's there and made the ones to the west of those which are predominantly residential the residential zone great sounds good any questions by committee

[Speaker 1] (1:39:16 - 1:40:34)
members all right then uh hearing none the first item document number a8867 alderman cruz moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum any objections hearing none that item is passed document number a8868 all the person point test moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum any objections hearing none the item is passed thank you uh chairman ervin do i have another item up or is that we ran them together sir no there was a second item the third item i should say right we did get your the private application in the 20th ward done already okay thank you with the type one change we'll follow up on that said it again we did that already the private application with the type one request thank you all right great thank you all right our last item of the day bottom of page two document number a8866 in the 40th ward ordinance referred to 2124 common addresses 1700 to 1706 west foster avenue change request is an rs3 residential single unit detached house district to b22 neighborhood mixed use district we have applicant alder vasquez hi there thank you so

[Speaker 23] (1:40:34 - 1:41:42)
much uh chairman um so the matter here we found out from the actual business there's a fat crisp pizza which is located in on foster that as they were looking to renew for awnings for for to continue the business uh found out that the current zoning was actually an impediment to what they were moving forward that led us to do a little bit of the research and so it created the opportunity to then change the zoning on that whole block to sort of match what's across the street um so i think it does a number of things that allows one of our local businesses to be able to move forward as it should um i think by changing the zoning it also offers the opportunity for in the future there would be more naturally occurring affordable housing as there's more opportunity there um you know we've had conversations about different areas in the ward that some of the zoning gets to be restrictive in a way that doesn't allow for affordability or some reasonable density um but first and foremost we want to make sure the business can operate uh especially given the nature of all of our local businesses so we we are in support and look forward to or i would ask the committee for favorable consideration great thank you
