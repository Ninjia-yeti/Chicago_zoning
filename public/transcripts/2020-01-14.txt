Alderman Hadden moves to defer. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Can you chair? The ayes have it and these items are deferred.

All right. Let's move on. At this time, we'll now hear the public comment period.

Out of respect for everyone's time, each speaker's limited to three minutes to address all items on the agenda. This will be the only opportunity to address these items on the agenda and the committee will not conduct separate public comment before each agenda item. All right.

Starting with Alan Mellis. Alan?

[Speaker 6] (3:07 - 3:10)
Good morning. Good morning.

[Speaker 1] (3:10 - 3:11)
Good morning, Alan.

[Speaker 6] (3:11 - 3:51)
Good morning, Tom. I am Alan Mellis representing Wrightwood Neighbors. We met with the owner of the four parcel single pin property at 2637 to 45 North Lakewood and as a result, Wrightwood Neighbors is in support of the rezoning of the property from M12 to RT4.

This property previously was a parking lot for the employees of the Peeless Confection Company, which has been replaced on Lakewood by mostly residential single family homes. The proposed single family home is consistent with other properties in the immediate area. Thank you and I'd be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (3:51 - 4:11)
Thank you, Alan. I know you're very familiar, as I am, with that section of Lakewood, former industrial and now residential, so we've both outlived both of those projects and look forward to the residential that is compatible, as you say, with the surrounding context. Next, George Blakemore.

[Speaker 17] (4:19 - 4:22)
I've told you several times, my name is Mr. Blakemore.

[Speaker 1] (4:23 - 4:24)
Good morning, Mr. Blakemore.

[Speaker 17] (4:24 - 7:22)
And you addressed me like that. Again, what's so egregious to all of our citizens here, when you came in and took the least place to that corruption, you changed the rules. You're making us speak on all the items three minutes.

Why would you do something like that? Why would you want to listen to the people when they sign up? If they sign up for 50 items, why would you want to hear from them?

You know who you are. You are a public servant. Sir, I'm talking to you.

You are a public servant and you're supposed to serve the public. You are supposed to serve the public. Why would you want to stifle the public from speaking?

What motivates you? Why would you want to have your meetings, all your meetings, at 10 o'clock? People can't go to both meetings at 10.

You know why you can do all of this? Because the people do not speak up. The people are silent.

So you're a little bullish here. The people are silent and you'll pay the plate here. You'll pay the plate.

And these black ones, they need to stop their talking too. They know what's right and what's wrong. And they're silent.

So this is a culture of corruption here. And in the preview several years ago, Mr. Blakemore, a little gag flash. That's insulting.

That's very insulting. A gag flash didn't do a nuisance. That's what they were trying to call a nuisance.

There's something inherently wrong with you and all of you and all of you to let them do that. They work for you. They're here to serve you.

Dr. King said silence is betrayal. You're a part of it too. When he came in and implemented that, you were supposed to step up and say, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

It's not going to go like this. You're going to listen to the public. But you got your $7 million for that flower up there on Belmont.

So you, all of you, and all of you allow this. At 10 o'clock in the morning where the working people can't come here. You get the kind of government you deserve and you deserve the kind of government you get.

You all are pitiful. This is not a dictatorship here.

[Speaker 1] (7:27 - 8:57)
Thank you, Mr. Blakemore. Happy New Year to you. All right.

More witnesses? Okay. And thank you.

That concludes the public comment portion of the meeting. Moving on to the addendum to the agenda. We're going to go a little bit out of order today as we have two appointments on the agenda, which we will hear first.

The appointments' resumes are in your packets. And if you care, well, you do care. So let's take a minute.

Get the resumes out. All right. Okay.

So first up is mayoral appointment 1926, the reappointment of Sam P. Toya as a member of the Zoning Board of Appeals for a term effective immediately and expiring on July 1st of 2024. Let me bring Mr. Toya up. Mr. Toya, over here.

[Speaker 33] (8:58 - 8:59)
Over here.

[Speaker 13] (9:05 - 9:07)
My fault. I'm sorry. Yeah.

[Speaker 1] (9:11 - 9:21)
All right. Good morning, Sam. Mr. Toya. Call me whatever you want. All right. Why are you going to do this again?

[Speaker 11] (9:22 - 9:27)
Well, I think that... Get right to the point. No, I get right to the point.

Why did you run again?

[Speaker 1] (9:28 - 9:32)
Because we love public service. There you go. There's the answer.

We love public service.

[Speaker 11] (9:33 - 9:52)
I think that throughout the years, I know everything from the 9th Ward to the 49th Ward, from the 7th Ward to the 45th Ward. I think I've known the neighborhoods even better and better, so I love public service, and I think I know the city, like I said, from the south side to the north side, from the east side to the southwest side.

[Speaker 1] (9:54 - 9:56)
And how many years have you been serving, Sam?

[Speaker 11] (9:56 - 10:00)
I got appointed in the July of 2011.

[Speaker 1] (10:01 - 10:09)
Mm-hmm. All right. Questions?

Obviously, many of us know Mr. Toya. I'm sorry. Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 3] (10:10 - 10:53)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd just like to commend the mayor on his reappointment of Mr. Toya. Mr. Toya, he understands government. He understands Alderman. I think... I know that he respects Alderman's concerns for their ward.

He understands the intricacies of how we have to deal with our community, and that when we voice our opinion that is not about us, it's about the neighborhoods that we represent. So I appreciate him being on the Zoning Board of Appeal, and I think it's great that you have someone with that kind of knowledge on the board to be able to share it with other folks that's on that board.

[Speaker 1] (10:54 - 10:55)
Thank you, Alderman. Alderman Hopkins.

[Speaker 14] (10:58 - 11:14)
Mr. Chairman, I support this reappointment, and, Mr. Toya, your recitation of the geography of the various wards in the city that you know was impressive, but now to the next level, I would like you to recite by memory the borders of the second ward. You have 30 seconds.

[Speaker 11] (11:14 - 11:18)
I know we're going from East Village all the way to Streeterville. How's that?

[Speaker 1] (11:21 - 11:21)
Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 10] (11:26 - 11:36)
Thank you, Chairman. I would just like to say that of all the returning reappointments this administration is making, I think I'm most excited about yours, so congratulations.

[Speaker 30] (11:36 - 11:36)
Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 10] (11:36 - 11:38)
Thank you, Alderman. Alderman Deel.

[Speaker 30] (11:39 - 12:10)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I, too, wanted to chime in on this appointment. I think Mr. Toya is a wonderful addition to the Zoning Board of Appeals, and I think he will bring some balance to the Zoning Board of Appeals, which is very badly needed, and, again, he stated that he does know this city from one end to the other, and he is a man of his word, and he will continue to come into our communities and try to advocate on helping us as we redevelop our community. So thank you, Sam, and congratulations. Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (12:14 - 12:22)
All right. Move to pass. Alderman Lopez moves to pass on the appointment.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

[Speaker 14] (12:22 - 12:24)
Chairman, you're not going to give any opinion?

[Speaker 1] (12:26 - 12:27)
No. No.

[Speaker 33] (12:27 - 12:28)
Four.

[Speaker 1] (12:28 - 12:43)
Yeah. Well, all I can say is that I think you started in the 44th, if I'm not mistaken. I did.

I know too much. Let's leave it at that, but I really appreciate all your... Thank you.

...one of the hardest-working people there. Thank you.

[Speaker 32] (12:43 - 12:43)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (12:44 - 12:48)
So, continue to share the ayes have it. We'll report it out at the Council meeting. Thank you, Sam.

[Speaker 19] (12:48 - 12:50)
Thank you. All right. Thank you, Alderman.

Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (12:51 - 13:21)
Okay. Next up is mayoral appointment 1927, the appointment of Sue Ellen M. Burns as a member of the Commission on Chicago Landmarks for a term effective immediately and expiring on March 11th, 2023 to succeed Mary Ann Smith, whose term has expired.

Good morning. Good morning.

[Speaker 13] (13:23 - 14:42)
Thank you, Chairman Tunney and members of the committee. My name is Sue Ellen Burns. I'm honored that Mayor Lightfoot has appointed me for confirmation to serve on the Commission of Chicago Landmarks.

I've lived in the First Ward, specifically the Humboldt Park. neighborhood for almost 18 years. Professionally, I am senior program officer at the Richard H.

Driehaus Foundation. The Driehaus Foundation provides about 225 grants annually, primarily to groups who are based in and work in the city of Chicago. I'm also a graduate adjunct faculty member at the School of Public Service at DePaul University, where I teach ethics.

More broadly, I've been a professional in the arts, environmental, and urban planning fields for about 25 years, and throughout my personal and professional life, I've demonstrated a strong commitment to public service. To me, public service is one of the most noble callings. It would be a tremendous privilege to be part of the Commission, and I am excited about the opportunity to serve the people of Chicago.

Thank you for your consideration, and I'm happy to answer any questions. Thank you, Sue Ellen. Do we have questions from committee members?

[Speaker 1] (14:46 - 14:47)
Alderman Haddon?

[Speaker 13] (14:49 - 15:03)
Thank you, Chair. No questions, just a thank you. Thank you.

Looking over your resume, you've got a really interesting mix of qualifications, and I think will bring a lot to the Commission, so thank you.

[Speaker 1] (15:03 - 15:26)
Other questions? Well, I do want to comment. I'm very familiar with the Richard Driehaus Foundation and the amazing amount of work they do, and I've been to the museum, the landmark in and of itself, and also your background in urban planning and such is going to be, as I say, big shoes to fill with Alderman Mary Ann Smith.

[Speaker 13] (15:26 - 15:26)
Absolutely.

[Speaker 1] (15:27 - 15:31)
Originally, I thought you might be from the Andersonville neighborhood.

[Speaker 13] (15:31 - 15:34)
Well, I was way back when. I lived there for 15 years.

[Speaker 1] (15:34 - 15:37)
I think of Sue Ellen Long. Your name is so...

[Speaker 13] (15:37 - 15:41)
She and I are friendly. She's wonderful. She's the other Sue Ellen.

[Speaker 1] (15:41 - 16:06)
That's right. But no, really do appreciate it. I think the mayor made a tremendous appointment and looking forward to working and reprioritizing some energy to the landmark division.

I really feel we as a city have got to be a little bit more aggressive, I should say, with some of our neighborhoods because you've seen a lot of... You've been to Humboldt Park, so you've seen a lot of change.

[Speaker 32] (16:06 - 16:07)
Absolutely.

[Speaker 1] (16:07 - 16:11)
We want to keep the best of the best, and I know you'll be a great asset to the city.

[Speaker 32] (16:11 - 16:11)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (16:11 - 17:03)
No other questions? Alderman Lopez moves to pass. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? And again, we'll be reported out at Wednesday's meeting.

Have a great day. Thank you. All right.

Now we're moving on. We have an ordinance for the historical landmark designation in the 45th Ward, document number 02019-9384 for the historical landmark designation of the John Nuveen House located at 3916 North Trip Avenue. We have Ms. Hahn here from the Department of Planning and Development to talk a little bit about it and answer any questions. Good morning.

[Speaker 19] (17:03 - 17:04)
Thank you, Alderman Toney.

[Speaker 1] (17:04 - 17:06)
You got it. Perfect.

[Speaker 19] (17:08 - 18:24)
For the record, my name is Candalyn Hahn. I'm a project coordinator with the Department of Planning and Development. I'm here today to recommend to you on behalf of the Commission on Chicago Landmarks that the John Nuveen House at 3916 North Trip Avenue be designated as a Chicago landmark.

The John Nuveen House was built in 1892 with its wide lot, large size and picturesque architecture. The John Nuveen House represents the Irving Park neighborhood's early stage of development as one of Chicago's railroad suburbs in the 19th century. The house is an excellent example of residential architecture in the Queen Anne style, an architectural style of great significance in the history of Chicago and the United States.

The house is also significant for its original owner, John Nuveen, who was an important figure in Chicago's economic history. In 1898, Nuveen founded his own investment banking firm in Chicago, John Nuveen & Company, which became a nationally significant investment bank by the mid-20th century. The building is located in the 45th Ward, and Alderman James M.

Gardner has not provided comments on the proposed designation. On behalf of the Commission on Chicago Landmarks, I recommend passage of the ordinance designating the building as a Chicago landmark. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (18:25 - 18:37)
Questions from committee members? I have I'm very familiar with the Old Irving Park. I didn't realize it was a suburb until what year did we annex?

[Speaker 19] (18:37 - 18:40)
I don't actually have that information.

[Speaker 1] (18:40 - 18:42)
Lakeview, Ravenswood, Old Irving?

[Speaker 19] (18:43 - 18:48)
Yeah, it kind of went out, it bloomed out as the city developed. Each of those were annexed.

[Speaker 1] (18:48 - 18:56)
And just since I know they're wide lots, do you have an estimation of what the size of that lot is?

[Speaker 19] (18:56 - 19:05)
I think this one is 50 feet wide, so that's double And then how deep? I think it's also 125 feet, so it's very, all elevations are visible from around the block.

[Speaker 1] (19:06 - 19:14)
And if I'm not mistaken it could be in for some landmark tax credits, hopefully? Absolutely.

[Speaker 19] (19:14 - 19:19)
We'd love to see it rehabilitated, and I know that the community would also love to see that happen.

[Speaker 1] (19:21 - 19:25)
And so this was in front of the Landmarks Commission?

[Speaker 19] (19:25 - 19:27)
Yes, it went before the Landmarks Commission.

[Speaker 1] (19:28 - 19:32)
What was the feeling? Obviously you recommended it, but was there objectors?

[Speaker 19] (19:33 - 20:04)
The owner who had purchased it within the past couple of years to redevelop the site was not in favor of it. However, the Landmark Ordinance provides for a full hearing, and we did have a public hearing where representatives spoke for the owner, and that was taken into full consideration by the Commission. I'm confident and in fact we've been contacted by people who have an interest in purchasing and rehabilitating the structure so I'm confident the investor will be likely to recoup his investment.

[Speaker 1] (20:05 - 20:13)
Speaking of investments, Mr. Nuveen was obviously, still the company is one of the most successful companies in America, I believe.

[Speaker 19] (20:14 - 20:34)
That's correct. They took a spot that no one else was taking in the United States in giving financing to smaller governments in the Midwest. So being in Chicago is the perfect place to do that from.

That's the story in a nutshell for the Nuveen Company.

[Speaker 1] (20:35 - 23:07)
Any other questions? Do we have a motion to move do pass on this item? Alderman Hopkins moves do pass on the item.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

The ayes have it. This item will be the ordinance will be passed and reported out tomorrow. Thank you.

Thank you for your research on this too. Next on the addendum, we have an order for a historical landmark fee waiver and that is in the second ward document number 0R 2019-518 located at 1434 through 1444 West Augusta Boulevard. Any questions?

Alderman Hopkins? Move do pass. Okay, Alderman Hopkins moves do pass on the order.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

The ayes have it and this order will be passed and reported out at tomorrow's City Council meeting. Great. Alright moving on.

The large signs over 100 square feet in area, 24 feet above grade. We'll hear them all together. I will read the ward followed by the address and take a motion at the end.

Starting in the 45th ward two signs located at 5160 North Northwest Highway in the 44th ward four signs located at 3630 North Southport Avenue in the 42nd ward two signs located at 220 West Illinois Street again in the 42nd ward 600 North Michigan Avenue in the 32nd ward two signs at 2434 North Sacramento Avenue in the 27th ward 1440 North Dayton Street and we're going to skip the next three because we're going to have a substitute and then let me go okay I'm sorry okay so we're going to skip those three I'll get back to them but in the 27th ward 1132 North Blackhawk Street in the 27th ward 1020 North Elston Avenue again in the 27th ward 1300 North North Branch Street and lastly in the second ward 2233 West Division Street any

[Speaker 33] (23:08 - 23:09)
okay

[Speaker 1] (23:10 - 23:54)
follow the script Tom any questions from committee members on these signs Alderman Beal moves do pass on the orders all those in favor aye any opposed opinion chair ayes haven't and these will be reported out at tomorrow's City Council meeting now we're going to go back to three signs in the 27th ward these are located at 333 North Green Street we have substitutes for all three orders do I hear a motion to move the substitute orders Alderman Haddon moves to accept the substitute on these orders with that do I hear a motion do pass

[Speaker 30] (23:54 - 23:56)
what's the substitute Mr. Chairman

[Speaker 1] (23:56 - 24:01)
I'll Nicole from my staff Nicole

[Speaker 13] (24:01 - 24:20)
Wellhousing Committee on Zoning these applicants incorrectly put the sign company as the applicant rather than the company that the permit will be issued to so the substitutes are to take the sign company out and put the company with which the permit will be issued to

[Speaker 1] (24:23 - 24:38)
so with that Alderman Beal moves to pass on the orders as amended all those in favor aye and opposed continue to share the ayes have it and these are passed as amended alright now

[Speaker 33] (24:39 - 24:41)
what do we

[Speaker 1] (24:42 - 25:33)
okay okay so we've got a couple things we want to address before the mayoral ordinance on modifying cannabis related zoning provisions so we're going to skip that for the time being and we're going to move to the regular agenda alright bottom of page 4 document number 20293 in the 37th ward ordinances referred on December 18th of 19 and the common address 5427 through 29 west north avenue change request B31 community shopping district to a B22 neighborhood mixed use district

[Speaker 25] (25:34 - 26:03)
councilor good morning chairman for the record Nick Petikas from the law offices of Sam Banks I'm here on behalf of the applicant and property owner Mr. Frank Cam we're proposing a zoning change to establish a B2-2 zoning district so that two vacant retail storefronts within the building can be converted to B2-2 handicap accessible residential units we've met with the alderman we believe we have the alderman's support to proceed today and of course I defer to her on the final position

[Speaker 16] (26:05 - 26:42)
thank you Mr. Chairman Mr. Chairman I'm here today to ask the committee for their support for zoning changes as I feel that the use is going to be a great use for the community to make handicapped accessible apartments for those floors rather than the space being vacant on the main street there so if you all would consider doing that we'll be blessed to be able to have some disabled people have a place to live thank you

[Speaker 30] (26:43 - 27:17)
questions from committee members Alderman Beal thank you Mr. Chairman I just want to chime in and commend Alderman Mitts on allowing two units to be developed into handicapped accessible units I think it's very creative and shows a lot of passion and dedication for people with disabilities we do need more housing and I think that's a great use to take a storefront that's on the ground unit and make that accessible so everybody is to be commended on this, thank you

[Speaker 1] (27:18 - 27:23)
other questions Alderman, quick question for me is there parking

[Speaker 11] (27:25 - 27:25)

good morning Mr. Chairman members of the committee and happy new year everyone my name is Agnes Plaka I'm an attorney with the office of Mark Kubik and Associates located at 77 West Washington Chicago and I'm here to represent the applicant Chicago Title Land Trust number 1945 and I have here with me one of the beneficiaries Kyle Nicolage and this property has been in the family for more than 60 years it has been improved with an existing three and a half story frame building this is basically the smallest building on the block and the applicant is proposing to redevelop the property with a new four story building with four dwelling units and this zoning change is needed to comply with both the minimum lot area and the floor area ratio the subject property has a substandard depth so this zoning change will allow for that extra floor area and extra unit we have met with 47th ward advisory committee the applicant also has met with the Lakeview Chamber of Commerce we received their support and I believe that the Alderman also has sent his support letter so we respectfully ask for your support today as well.

[Speaker 1] (35:29 - 35:40)
So we do have a letter of support from Alderman Martin questions from committee members quick question for me the chamber is supporting residential on that block?

[Speaker 16] (35:40 - 36:00)
Yes the applicant has done a lot of research they actually own another commercial building nearby which has been vacant for many years the existing commercial space this is an existing mixed use building has been vacant for some time they have been terrible time attracting any good tenants for the commercial space

[Speaker 1] (36:00 - 36:50)
so the Alderman and the chamber are on board correct questions can I have a motion to move to pass on the item Alderman Hadden moves to pass on the item all those in favor aye any opposed the ayes have it and good luck thank you so much staying in the 47th ward bottom of page 2 document number 20276 T1 in 47 the common address 1757 West School Street and the change request RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RM4.5 residential multi-unit district I got it Fred

[Speaker 11] (36:51 - 38:07)
good morning Mr. Chairman and members of the committee for the record Fred Augustin the attorney on this matter with offices at 33 Northwest South Street I'm here today on behalf of the applicants Jeffrey and Catherine Powell Catherine Powell is here with me today the applicants own the property at 1757 West School Street it's currently improved with a 2.5 story single family residence we are seeking to rezone the property from the RS3 single unit detached house district to an RM4.5 residential multi-unit district the existing home will remain and will be rehabbed with a small re-addition as well as dormers to the 3rd floor the reason why we're seeking this zoning change is for the floor area ratio currently the home contains around 3,706 square feet with the dormers and the addition the total house will contain 4,074 square feet so in order to support that square footage we need to rezone the property to an RM4.5 and once the rehab of the home has been completed we will down zone the property back to the RS3 designation we have worked with Alderman Martin and his office, we have also presented for the 47th Ward Zoning Advisory Committee all in earned support I believe you should have a letter of support in the file

[Speaker 1] (38:07 - 39:35)
we do have the conditional support that it would be rezoned upon acquiescence of the permits yes questions?

I had an opportunity to look at the house not that far from it, it's a very interesting house and we've got a lot of work to do here trying to figure out all those dormers I looked at the application and I thought this is a unique request how old is the house actually alright, other questions? no questions Alderman Lopez moves to pass on the item all those in favor, aye any opposed the ayes have it good luck to you thank you Fred alright let's look at page 3 47th Ward document number 20266 T1 in the 47th Ward ordinance again referred on December 18 of 2019 common address 1839-41 West Irving Park Road and the change request, B32 Community Shopping District to a C23 Motor Vehicle related commercial district Ms. Barnes happy new year

[Speaker 2] (39:45 - 42:44)
to you and the other members of the board and good morning for the record my name is Sarah Barnes and I'm an attorney with the Lobsters of Sandbanks located at 221 North LaSalle Street I am happy to be here this morning on behalf of the applicant Derrick 1839 Irving LLC as the chairman alluded seated next to me is one of the members of that LLC Sean Patrick Derrick Jr. the Derricks recently purchased the subject property which is located at 1839-41 West Irving Park Road coincidentally located directly adjacent to not only the Derricks principal office but also the Derricks resident one of the Derricks residences they purchased the building which is sorry the property which is presently improved with a two story mixed use building which contains an old tavern on the first floor and two dwelling units above when the Derricks took control of the property the two dwelling units on the second floor were in pretty deplorable condition almost uninhabitable the Derricks undertook some significant repairs to bring them into a condition where they felt the tenants could remain and occupy the premises in a safe condition unfortunately the premises is in such bad condition that they do need to demolish the building but the good side of that is they are looking to redevelop the site then with a new three story mixed use building that will replace the existing building the proposed new building will have a total of seven dwelling units between the second and third floors excuse me actually between the basement all the way through the third floor there will be commercial space and retail space again on the first floor and because this property is located immediately adjacent to the owl station we are seeking to effectuate this zoning change pursuant to the transit oriented development ordinance and as such we are reducing the parking down to three vehicles it is again located directly adjacent to the CTA station we've been working with Alderman Martin as well as his internal zoning advisory committee and the north center chamber of commerce towards the programming for this site as well and in consideration of the zoning the Derricks have agreed to work with the existing residential tenants of the building in relocating them to new housing within the ward so with that we do have the support of the zoning advisory committee the north center chamber of commerce as well as Alderman Martin who has tendered a copy or tendered a letter of support to the committee with that we'd be happy to answer any questions and we respectfully request the support of this committee

[Speaker 1] (42:44 - 42:50)
questions from committee members hi

[Speaker 2] (42:52 - 42:52)
okay

[Speaker 1] (42:53 - 42:56)
so why C zoning over there

[Speaker 2] (42:57 - 43:00)
it's just it was consistent with what was already on the block

[Speaker 1] (43:00 - 43:14)
well you've worked with you talked about programming I'm sorry hold on a second hold on a second I'll get to Patrick in a second you talked about programming with the community so what is programming for the ground what's your intention on the ground floor

[Speaker 2] (43:14 - 43:34)
and Sean if you want to address it but it'll probably be residential services we've worked with the chamber to get in they do not want to have a large commercial space there a deep one because they've had some trouble policing those spaces so go ahead and yeah can you say your name and I'm Patrick

[Speaker 4] (43:34 - 44:05)
my address is 1843 West Irving Park Road the commercial space there we've actually made it about a thousand square feet just to shade over up and down Irving there are unfortunately some vacancies in larger retail spaces and they're difficult to rent because nobody wants to pay for the back as far as the type of tenant we're looking for we're actually working with the north center chamber of commerce to see what would be a good fit there ideally a coffee shop or something that would service both the L patrons as well as

[Speaker 23] (44:05 - 44:15)
people in the neighborhood it'd be great however I have a coffee shop as a neighbor already and I wouldn't want to wish that ill will upon him but some type of you know residential

[Speaker 1] (44:15 - 44:23)
well C2 is a very expansive definition so did you want to comment Patrick

[Speaker 4] (44:23 - 44:38)
Patrick Murphy Department of Planning just that the C zoning is not consistent the entire multiple blocks in both directions on both sides of the street are anywhere from B1 to B3 there's one C parcel about a block and a half to the west on the other side of the street

[Speaker 1] (44:40 - 45:06)
questions other questions but you have the chamber support and you have the alderman support we do yes we do we have it on file okay other questions if not can I get a motion to pass on the item alderman Hopkins moves to pass on the item all those in favor aye any opposed the ayes have it reported out

[Speaker 2] (45:06 - 45:07)
thank you so much

[Speaker 1] (45:08 - 45:11)
yep just C2 is pretty expansive

[Speaker 2] (45:11 - 45:22)
yeah the other reason for that was the personal service uses there's been some talk about having and exactly which would be good for a smaller salon

[Speaker 1] (45:22 - 45:38)
and we're all aware of some of our vacancies on our major streets so I'm going to ask alderman Kaplan former chairman of the zoning committee to step in and item in the 4T James James I didn't want to

So the next item which is in the 35th ward is going to be deferred. Let me read it into the record. That is item number 20302T1, 35th ward.

Ordinance referred on December 18th of 19, common address 3863 through 3909 North Drake Avenue. And that change request was RS3 residential single unit district and C11 neighborhood commercial district to a B22 neighborhood mixed-use district. So this is being deferred by the attorney.

All right. Then the motion to defer. Alderman Wongsbeck moves to defer on the item.

This item is deferred. To a specific date or not? No.

Okay. Great. So we're at the bottom of page 5, document number 20288T1 in the 33rd ward.

Ordinance was referred on December 18th of 19, common address 4500 through 4502 North Sawyer Avenue and 3240 West Sunnyside. Change request RS3 residential single unit detached house district to a B23 neighborhood mixed-use district. Good morning.

[Speaker 5] (58:30 - 59:48)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Tyler Manick of the Shane Banks Law Firm. I'm here on behalf of the applicant Bass Realty 3 LLC, owner of the subject property at 4500 North Sawyer.

For the applicant is Andrew Levin. The existing building is a three-story, 13-dwelling unit building and is a transit serve location. The applicant has 15 existing units there, two in the ground floor.

The applicant has owned this property since 1999 and went to pull permits to upgrade the electrical system and discovered that the two ground floor units aren't being recognized as conforming to the city. So we're seeking the zoning amendment in order to make those two ground floor units conforming and allow him to upgrade that electrical service. There's going to be no change to the height and exterior of the building.

There will be no commercial space here. The applicant has discussed this project with the alderman and went through the 33rd ward zoning community review process and has the alderman's support. We did give the committee the letter of support from the alderman and based on the foregoing, the applicant respectfully requests the committee's support and we'd be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (59:50 - 59:53)
Tyler, is there a substitute?

[Speaker 5] (59:54 - 1:00:06)
Correct. In the application, the narrative was mismarked as a substitute narrative. Because of that, we are seeking to do a substitute narrative.

[Speaker 1] (1:00:07 - 1:00:11)
Say that again. You sound like we had a substitute and now we need a substitute?

[Speaker 5] (1:00:11 - 1:00:24)
Well, when we filed the application, we mismarked the narrative as a substitute narrative. So we're seeking now to make that narrative a substitute narrative. I don't even know how to say it.

[Speaker 1] (1:00:24 - 1:01:59)
Negatives. Negate each other. Okay.

I'll accept that. Alderman Hadden moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type 1 application. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? The substitute narrative is accepted.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. All right. Well, now we have to vote, I think.

Questions from committee members on this project? Hearing none, I need a motion based on the substitute narrative. Okay.

So Alderman Beal moves to pass on the item with the substitute narrative and plans. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? The ayes have it and we'll report it out. Thank you very much.

All right. Okay. Top of page 6.

Item number 20290, T1, 32nd Ward. Ordinance referred on December 18th of 19. Common address, 1887 through 1891 North Milwaukee Avenue.

And the change request, M11, Limited Manufacturing Business Park District to a B11 Neighborhood Shopping District. Good morning. Are we still morning?

[Speaker 30] (1:02:01 - 1:02:04)
Clearly. Doing pretty good. We're good.

[Speaker 2] (1:02:06 - 1:04:00)
Good morning again, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. Once again, for the record, my name is Sarah Barnes and I'm an attorney with the lobsters of Sandbanks. Happy to be here this morning on behalf of the applicant, Elliott Rush Realty LLC.

Here with me is the managing member of that LLC, Louise Perlin, seated to my far right, as well as our consultant, Hannah Mazey. Mr. Perlin recently purchased the property with his wife, Shannon. The property is generally located at 1887 through 91 North Milwaukee Avenue and is currently improved with a two-story brick building, which was previously occupied by an auto repair facility.

The Perlins are looking to repurpose the existing building with a new daycare facility for the residents of the neighborhood. Ms. Mazey was brought in as a consultant because she has several years of experience with daycare facilities. She was the director of operations for the Nook daycare facilities that operate throughout the city of Chicago and she will be managing the proposed operations as well.

With this in mind, the Perlins and myself and Ms. Mazey have met with Alderman Wagenstein as well as the local community group, the Bucktown Community Organization, regarding the proposed repurposing of this property. And we do believe that we have the support of all of those parties as well. And towards these ends, no physical expansion of the existing building is necessary or proposed.

So this zoning change is intended just to allow for the change of use of the subject property. With that, I believe Alderman Wagenstaff is here and could perhaps bring more light to this.

[Speaker 6] (1:04:01 - 1:04:13)
Hi, Alderman. Thank you, Chairman. I am in support of this project and we definitely have a need for more daycare, so I think this is an appropriate use.

And I would ask for the committee's support of this zoning change.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:14 - 1:05:06)
Thank you, Alderman. Questions for the Alderman and or Council on the project? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move do pass?

Alderman Hopkins moves do pass on the item. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? The ayes have it and the item is passed. Thank you so much.

Thank you. Good luck to you. It's a very competitive market.

All right. Now we're moving into the famous 30th Ward. For document number 20274T1, 30th Ward, ordinance referred on December 18th of 19, common address 3301 North Harding Avenue and 3924 West School Street.

Change request, RS3, residential single unit detached house district to an RM4.5 residential multi-unit district.

[Speaker 5] (1:05:07 - 1:06:27)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Tyler Manick with the Shane Banks Law Firm. I'm the attorney for the owner of the property of 3301 North Harding, Sherway Investments, LLC.

With me is the applicant's principals, Nico Iancencio and Mathir Patel, as well as the applicant's architect, Jaime Giscan. The applicant is seeking a zoning amendment to an RM4.5 in order to bring the existing legal non-conforming seven-unit building in compliance with the current zoning ordinance, as well as add two additional ground floor units for a total of nine dwelling units. The applicant has agreed with the aldermen to make these two additional dwelling units to be affordable under the affordable requirements ordinance.

The existing building will remain the same size, scale, and design. The applicant is also adding two parking spaces with these two additional dwelling units. Prior to filing this amendment, the applicant met with the aldermen on a couple of times and also met with the Avondale Neighbors Association to work out the details of this plan.

Through those meetings, I do believe we reached the aldermen's support. We did issue a letter of support, but the alderman is here to confirm that. With the alderman's support, we respectfully request this committee's support and would be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 3] (1:06:29 - 1:06:40)
Alderman? Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am in full support of this.

RS3 does not fit in with a seven-unit building, existing building, let me say that.

[Speaker 20] (1:06:41 - 1:06:59)
And the objective is to also create some affordable requirements ordinance, two units that will be in the lower level, and there's additional two parking spaces, which is well needed in the area. So I'm in full compliance with this, support it. I ask for your support on this matter.

[Speaker 1] (1:06:59 - 1:07:13)
Questions for the alderman? No. Hearing no, I have a motion by Alderman Beal to move to pass on the item.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

Continuing to share the ayes have it.

[Speaker 5] (1:07:13 - 1:07:14)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (1:07:15 - 1:07:49)
Thank you. Top of page eight. Are we in the 27?

Yes. Okay. All right.

Top of page eight, item number 20291T1, the 27th ward ordinance referred on December 18th of 19, common address 694 North Milwaukee Avenue, and the change request. M13, limited manufacturing business park district to a C13 neighborhood commercial district.

[Speaker 2] (1:07:55 - 1:07:55)
No?

[Speaker 29] (1:07:56 - 1:07:56)
Nope.

[Speaker 2] (1:07:57 - 1:10:26)
Okay. Good morning again, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. Once again, for the record, my name is Sarah Barnes, and I'm an attorney with the Loftus and Stamp Bank.

Happy to be here still today on behalf of the applicant, 694 LLC. Here with me today is one of the managing members of that LLC, Jamie Howell. Jamie and his wife recently acquired the property located at 694 North Milwaukee Avenue.

The subject property is currently improved with a two-story mixed-use building, which contains a tavern. Immediately adjacent to and connected to the existing building is a very, well, not very large, but a pretty sizable outdoor space that to date has not been able to be occupied or utilized due to the current M1 zoning at the subject property. Mr. Hale, some of you may know, previously operated and owned the Globe Pub for many, many years, recently sold that, and they currently operate A.J. Hudson's, which is another sports bar up in Lakeview. The tavern that they acquired at 694 is intended to be a little bit more of an upscale lounge for the neighborhood, which will have wine and different cocktails. As part of their proposed operations at the subject site, they would like to incorporate the outdoor patio to allow for use during some of the warmer months. So with that, we do require a zoning change.

Again, it is just to allow for the use of the outdoor space in conjunction with the existing tavern operations. There is no physical expansion of the proposed building, either required or intended. The applicant and myself have met with and actually worked on an ongoing basis with the neighbors of River West towards an operating program for the proposed new tavern.

As well, we had a community meeting that Alderman Burnett attended, and we do at this time, we are happy to report back that we do have the support of the neighbors of River West, as well as the immediately adjacent residents of the neighborhood, and perhaps Alderman Burnett would like to speak to that as well.

[Speaker 1] (1:10:27 - 1:10:36)
Alderman Burnett, do you want to speak on the item on 694 North Milwaukee? Our outdoor patio?

[Speaker 2] (1:10:37 - 1:10:42)
Bar. The Dandy Crown Pub.

[Speaker 3] (1:10:44 - 1:10:59)
Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. I have no problem with this. They met with the local community organization, which is the neighbors of River West.

They supported it. So with that, I'm in support of it. Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (1:10:59 - 1:11:02)
Just a quick question. What's the size of the outdoor patio?

[Speaker 2] (1:11:06 - 1:11:24)
Very good question. It's about 2,000, just over 2,000 square feet. And it's fully enclosed with a fence.

[Speaker 1] (1:11:24 - 1:11:28)
But there's only 694 as the address. Is it more than one lot?

[Speaker 2] (1:11:29 - 1:11:36)
That was the common address assigned to it. It's kind of an odd-shaped lot. It's a triangle-shaped lot.

[Speaker 1] (1:11:37 - 1:11:42)
So yeah, it's probably multiple parcels. Neighbors are good? The alderman's good?

[Speaker 2] (1:11:42 - 1:11:44)
Neighbors are so good, yeah.

[Speaker 1] (1:11:44 - 1:11:56)
Can I get a motion? Move do pass on the item. Alderman Wolgastek moves do pass on the item.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

Chair, the ayes have it. And good luck to you.

[Speaker 2] (1:11:56 - 1:11:57)
Thank you so much.

[Speaker 1] (1:11:57 - 1:12:26)
All right. Now we're in the middle of page eight. Again, in the 27th ward, item number 20281.

Ordinance was referred on December 18th of last year, 19. Common address, 341 through 347 North Kedzie Avenue, and 3148 through 58 West Carroll Avenue. Change request, B12 Neighborhood Shopping District to B32 Community Shopping District.

[Speaker 10] (1:12:30 - 1:13:42)
Good morning. Good morning. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant. Here with me is Corey Williams, the applicant. The matter before you involves a rezoning to a B32 district.

Mr. Williams purchased this property a while back. And he has rehabbed the building there and is seeking to expand it. So he has built a space for art, a work space for production of art, as well as an art gallery on the property that he uses to promote high school students in their efforts to produce art, as well as some after school activities.

He wishes to use the facility also for banquets, small meeting places. It has capacity for about 80 people inside, based on the city's records. But because he was on B12, he couldn't have those.

So the B32 would facilitate that particular use. He does have enough parking to meet the parking requirements on site.

[Speaker 1] (1:13:44 - 1:14:02)
Well, we know where Alderman Burnett is on it. So any questions from committee members? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move due pass on the item?

Alderman Brendan Riley moves due pass on the item. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? I'm sure the ayes have it. And the item is passed.

[Speaker 10] (1:14:03 - 1:14:03)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:14:05 - 1:14:37)
Good luck to you, sir. All right. Staying in the, oh, no.

We're moving to the 26th Ward. Item number 20289T1 in the 26th Ward, common address, 2243 West Brand Avenue. And the change request, C32, manufacturing and employment district to a B23 neighborhood mixed use district.

Great. Nick, identify yourself, please. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 25] (1:14:37 - 1:15:22)
Nick Fitikas from the Law Offices of Sam Banks. I'm here on behalf of the applicant and property owner, the Esperanza Alicia Revocable Trust. We are proposing to replace an existing two-unit residential building with a proposed three-unit residential building.

In order to do that, we're seeking a zoning change from the C3-2 district to a B2-3 zoning district. We've met with Alderman Maldonado, and we have provided a letter of support from the Alderman on the matter, and we'd be happy to answer any questions you might have about the project. Were there any changes to the Type 1?

Oh, I apologize. Yes, we did file a substitute plans and narrative, so I would ask that the substitute plan and narrative be incorporated into today's proceeding.

[Speaker 1] (1:15:24 - 1:16:39)
Alderman Riley moves to accept the substitute narrative plans for the Type 1 application. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Hearing none, the ayes have it. And the substitute narrative plans are accepted.

Thank you. And questions now on the application as amended? No questions.

Can I get a motion to move to pass by Alderman Hadden, move to pass with the substitutive narrative and plans? All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Senior Chair, the ayes have it. The substitute is accepted, narrative plans, and we're reporting it out to the Wednesday City Council.

Thank you so much. Thank you. All right.

Top of page 9, again in the 26th Ward, number 20268. 26th Ward ordinance referred on December 18th of 2019. Common address, 1849 North Pulaski Road.

Change request, RS3, residential single unit detached house to an RT4, residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district. Good morning, Mr. Moore.

[Speaker 6] (1:16:39 - 1:16:40)
Good morning.

[Speaker 1] (1:16:40 - 1:16:41)
Can you identify yourself?

[Speaker 6] (1:16:41 - 1:17:35)
My name, for the record, is Thomas S. Moore. And with me today is Edna Yara.

Ms. Yara grew up in the neighborhood, and her family still lives there. She's been away for a few years, but she now has purchased this building. So it will enable her to move back into the neighborhood that she's lived most of her life.

The city recognizes a legal two-flat here, but there is an additional unit that she'd like to make legal. And this zoning would allow her to do it. We met with Alderman Maldonado, and we have a letter of support.

And Ms. Yara knows the neighbors. And to her knowledge, there are no objectives. So we request your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (1:17:35 - 1:17:49)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Maldonado. Do we have questions on this application from committee members? Hearing no questions.

Do we have a question? Yes, Alderman Kappelman. I'm sorry.

[Speaker 15] (1:17:50 - 1:18:07)
Sure. I just wanted to make a comment. We talk about the need for affordable housing.

This kind of thing does exactly that. So I so wholeheartedly support this. And I thank Alderman Maldonado for being the lead on this.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:18:08 - 1:18:25)
Thank you, Alderman. Other questions? Hearing no more questions, can I have a motion?

Move to pass by Alderman Haddon. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? I didn't hear the ayes have it. And the item is reported out as passed.

Thank you very much.

[Speaker 6] (1:18:25 - 1:18:25)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:18:25 - 1:19:20)
Thank you for staying in our city and investing. All right. Top page 10 in the 25th Ward, application number 20285-T1.

Again, 25th Ward, common address, 1900 West 17th Street. The change request, M12 Limited Manufacturing Business Park District to a B23 Neighborhood Mixed Use District. Good morning.

[Speaker 31] (1:19:20 - 1:20:16)
Good morning. My name is Jimena Castro from Acosta-Escar. And to my right is Teo Scorte, who is the applicant for this rezoning.

We're here today to rezone from a B23, from a M12 to a B23, to allow for seven dwelling units to be added for a total of 11 units on the property. This is a two-story building containing four residential dwelling units with no parking spaces. And the rezoning will allow for the added units.

We will be providing two efficiency units on site. No parking will be added. And we are seeking relief through this type one application to reduce all required parking pursuant to the serve location provisions of the ordinance.

This is also a substitute narrative, so I would like to ask to incorporate the substitute narrative and plans to the record, please.

[Speaker 1] (1:20:16 - 1:20:32)
All right. I'm going to ask Alderman Siccio-Lopez to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type one application. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? Hearing none, the substitute narrative and plans are accepted.

[Speaker 31] (1:20:33 - 1:20:45)
Thank you. We also met with the alderman, Alderman Siccio-Lopez, and with his community board at his ward office. And I believe we have their support and the alderman is here today as well.

[Speaker 1] (1:20:46 - 1:20:51)
We have the alderman, Alderman Siccio-Lopez. Would you like to comment on the application?

[Speaker 9] (1:20:53 - 1:20:56)
The applicant has the support of the community board office.

[Speaker 1] (1:20:56 - 1:22:06)
Has your support and the community support? Community support, yeah. Questions for the alderman and the applicant?

Hearing none, then I'd like to move the substitute narrative plans for the type one. All those in favor of accepting this? I'm sorry.

Alderman Hadden moves on the motion. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Can you share the ayes? Have it with the substitute narrative and plans.

All right. Thank you, sir. All right.

Now we're going to stay in the, what are we doing? Okay. We're going to skip a couple and move to the top of page 11.

[Speaker 16] (1:22:28 - 1:23:03)
Karen Shaw on behalf of Shaw Legal Services and Schiller Player. We're here representing Yabrood Real Estate, seeking a zoning amendment change from an RT4 to a B1-1. My client is seeking to build a Michicana, an ice cream shop.

It's approximately 1,097 square feet. And he has the alderman's support and the community support. He believes that the Michicana will benefit the community.

And we're open to any questions, if any.

[Speaker 1] (1:23:04 - 1:23:09)
Great. Well, I know the alderman is here. Alderman Rodriguez, would you like to comment on this?

Yes.

[Speaker 4] (1:23:10 - 1:23:13)
There's no opposition in the community. And more importantly, my daughter is very excited about this.

[Speaker 1] (1:23:14 - 1:23:38)
So we are in support. Well, that's exciting. Wish it was a little closer to Belmont-Clark, but no.

Well, we certainly applaud the enterprise and the enterprising nature of the group. Yes. To also state that this is in the Southwest area and an investment in the North Lawndale community.

[Speaker 4] (1:23:38 - 1:23:44)
This is a dilapidated space that's been empty for some years now. We're excited that there's a development happening there.

[Speaker 1] (1:23:46 - 1:24:56)
Great, alderman. And congratulations. Do we have any questions for the alderman or the applicant?

Hearing none. I'm going to get a motion by alderman Brendan Riley moves to pass. All those in favor?

And good luck. And congratulations. It's only the beginning.

We know that. All right. Thank you.

Thank you. All right. Now we're moving back to page 10, the middle.

All right. Middle page 10, document number 20283T1 in the 25th ward. The ordinance was referred on December 18th of 19 and the common address, 1758 West 19th Street.

And the change request, RT4, residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to a B2-3 neighborhood mixed-use district. Tyler.

[Speaker 5] (1:24:56 - 1:26:18)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Tyler Manick of the Shane Banks Law Firm. I'm here on behalf of the applicant, Pilsen Rentals, LLC, Series 19th Street.

On behalf of the applicant is Paul Sekiris, who is the manager of the applicant. The applicant has been and is the owner of the property of 1758 West 19th Street. The property is an existing three-and-a-half-story mixed-use building with four dwelling units and 755 square feet of commercial space.

This property is a transit-serve location. The applicant seeks a zoning amendment to add three dwelling units that are considered non-conforming at this time to the existing building and the scope of work under this application is interior renovations only. After rezoning, the property will have seven dwelling units and 755 square feet of commercial space.

The existing exterior of the building will not change, nor will the size or scale of that building. Prior to filing the application, the applicant met with the aldermen and the aldermen's community advisory board and has received the support from both the board and the aldermen. We have submitted a letter of support, but I do believe the alderman is here as well to speak on it.

Accordingly, we respectfully request the committee's favorable recommendation of this zoning application. We'd be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (1:26:19 - 1:26:22)
Okay. Tyler, do we have a substitute on this one, too?

[Speaker 5] (1:26:22 - 1:26:23)
I don't believe so.

[Speaker 1] (1:26:27 - 1:26:27)
I'm sorry? Are we?

[Speaker 5] (1:26:31 - 1:26:34)
Well, at that time, I'd move for a substitute.

[Speaker 1] (1:26:34 - 1:26:38)
You want to make sure that... I'd believe them if they did.

[Speaker 5] (1:26:39 - 1:26:39)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:26:42 - 1:27:57)
Okay, so then I'm going to ask Alderman Siccio-Lopez to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type one application. All those in favor of that? Say aye.

Any opposed? I'm not sure the ayes have it. So the substitute's in front of us and has been accepted.

Now on the motion. We have a motion to move. Alderman Siccio-Lopez moves to pass with the substantive narrative and plans.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

I'm not sure the ayes have it. And the item will be reported out with the substantive narrative and plans. Thank you.

All right. Thank you, Tyler. And now we're still on page 10.

And this is document number 20275T1 in the 25th Ward. The ordinance was referred on December 18th of 2019. Common address, 1925 South May Street.

And change request, RT4, residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to B23 neighborhood mixed-use district. Great.

[Speaker 27] (1:27:57 - 1:29:17)
Hi. Good morning. Good morning, Chairman, members of the committee.

For the record, my name is Attorney John Escobar on behalf of the property owner and the applicant regarding the type one zoning amendment request for the property located at 1925 South May. The applicant seeks a type one zoning amendment change from the current RT4 zoning district to a B23 zoning district. The applicant intends to keep the existing use of the land but will increase the bulk and density of the minimum lot area to allow a retail office business on the ground level, which is currently vacant, and allow a total of five dwelling units on the property.

The applicant will also add one additional parking space for a total of two on-site parking spaces. The two upper floors will not be altered, no change to the height or the exterior of the building. We have met with the alderman and have garnered his support.

I do have a letter of support. If you'd like, I can tender to you now. Yes.

We'll hear from the alderman also, but thank you. Given that, and accordingly, we respectfully request your favorable support and recommendation, and we're ready to take any questions as well.

[Speaker 1] (1:29:17 - 1:29:22)
Okay. Let's hear from the alderman at this point. Alderman Sitio Lopez.

[Speaker 9] (1:29:23 - 1:29:45)
Thank you, Mr. Chair. We have met, as the attorney has said, with the applicant and the zoning advisory board, so the application has a recommendation. We're happy to support long-term residents and to make sure that we have a revitalized area in the building community.

So we support the applicant.

[Speaker 1] (1:29:45 - 1:29:59)
Okay. Questions for Alderman Sitio Lopez or the applicant? I have a quick question.

Are we hedging on the B2? Because obviously you could do residential in that, too.

[Speaker 27] (1:29:59 - 1:30:08)
Yeah, so this one was for the additional dwelling unit on the first floor, so it's going to be an efficiency unit. In the back? In the back, right.

[Speaker 1] (1:30:08 - 1:31:05)
Okay. All right. Great.

Any other motion? Motion by Alderman Sitio Lopez to move due pass on the item. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? Then, the Chair, the ayes have it.

Item will be reported out. Thank you. All right.

record for today's hearing thank you alderman Dowell moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission all in favor say aye opposed any chair the

[Speaker 21] (1:51:20 - 1:52:29)
ayes have it continue the site was previously home to a plating company that structure has since been demolished and it is currently a vacant lot the proposed use is to construct 28 dwelling units with 28 respective parking spaces the team has worked extensively with the community and the alderman's office specifically 12 meetings in total to make sure that the neighborhood is in approval with the planned hand through that effort we have received support from alderman Tunney's office as well as the community which mr. alderman Tunney can speak to that we have also worked closely with Commissioner Navarro in the Department of Housing and we have worked an agreement to satisfy the requirements of the affordable requirements ordinance in addition we have worked closely with Department of Transportation regarding ingress and egress for the development and we have a approved plan from CDOT on that matter nothing further we're happy to answer any questions at this time any

[Speaker 15] (1:52:29 - 1:52:35)
questions chairman Tunney thank you alderman

[Speaker 1] (1:52:36 - 1:53:43)
councillors right we had a dozen meetings or so I think I was at most of them through all of them but it is a pretty big site for 28 townhouses probably the last I think it's the last manufacturing site in my ward so is it not happy to see them go but I think they've the plan is handsome it's adjacent to a new park in our neighborhood so I think it'd be a tremendous amenity it has already been an amenity to the neighborhood but these specific townhouses I think are going to move pretty quickly and we're excited about it obviously we spent and I want to thank the Department of Planning and zoning specifically and CDOT because you know it's a it's a odd lot covering you know both the Melrose side and the school side so I'm excited about it and it's taken it's taken a while but I think it's a good day for the ward and the community so I support it as does as did and do support Westlake

[Speaker 15] (1:53:43 - 1:53:55)
University thank you with that alderman reports moves do pass all in favor say aye opposed continue the chair the ayes have it pass this item is passed as

[Speaker 22] (1:53:55 - 1:54:14)
revised thank you very much all right we're gonna before we get to the deferred

[Speaker 1] (1:54:14 - 1:56:09)
agenda we're gonna we're gonna go back to the beginning of the agenda on the where's my okay so we're on mayoral application one nine two five the ordinance was referred on December 18th of 2019 and the document number 0 2 0 1 9 dash 9400 amendment of the municipal code chapters 17 3 17 4 17 17 14 and 17 17 by modifying cannabis related provisions I know okay we do have a substitute on the item alderman Roboius moves on the substitute all those in favor aye and any opposed hearing none the eyes have a substitutes in front of us all right so the substitute mayoral ordinance aligns the city's regulations with the state's updated guidelines pertaining to waiting and notification periods this version of the ordinance also removes any reference to on-site cannabis consumption from the use table and from the definitions of the Chicago zoning ordinance until and when and until the consumption rules and licensing protocols are resolved by BACP my understanding they have not been resolved yet but this is cleanup language is my understanding and who Patrick Patrick would you for the benefit of the public and our committee would you comment on the proposed ordinance yes thank you chairman good

[Speaker 4] (1:56:09 - 1:58:49)
afternoon chairman and members of the committee for the record my name is Patrick Murphy with the Department of Planning and Development I'm here to discuss the proposed changes as you summarized certain sections of the Chicago zoning ordinance as they relate to the use of recreational cannabis in the city of Chicago thank you for previously accepting the substitute ordinance the substitute addresses additional state statute section corrections since the original amendment was introduced earlier this winter the changes detailed in the proposed substitute ordinance are designed to one as you said remove any reference to on-site cannabis consumption from the use matrix and definitions of the zoning ordinance to the state recently enacted various waiting and notification periods this amendment will align our regulations the city's zoning ordinance regulations with the state's guidelines those will include at the time of a special use application when it's filed with the Zoning Board of Appeals the Zoning Board will post a public notice of the filing on its website and notify the local aldermen's office of such filing within three calendar days even though that hasn't already been an ordinance provision we have already been acting on that for the last several weeks since the state approved that legislation and since we have gotten applications in no action may be taken subsequent to that notification for seven calendar days on such an application so there could not be a hearing there wouldn't be any actions by the Zoning Board on any application that was subject to this notification period third previously the city's legislation mandated a 90-day waiting period once a legally sufficient petition seeking to prohibit the establishment of a cannabis business was received by the city clerk's office going forward the state has added an additional 90-day waiting period which takes effect once the city clerk publicly posts notice of intent to initiate such petition process our amendment accommodates this entire waiting period and could be as long now as 180 days or six months the department is proposing this so it's actually 180 plus the three days of the clerk there's three days so the no that would be different the the clerk and Zoning Board notifications deal with actual applications of the Zoning Board right petition is 180 days 180 days yes which would only be short-circuited if if the local alderman chooses to proceed with a petition through council sooner the department is proposing this substitute ordinance amendment as a follow-up to our legislation from October these regulations separately addressed in the other regulations separately addressed in the miscible code will be forthcoming as you alluded to in the meantime I'm happy to answer any zoning related questions that you

[Speaker 1] (1:58:49 - 1:58:53)
all may have thank you we'll start with committee members first

[Speaker 3] (1:58:57 - 1:59:23)
information wow this is nice these come on automatically and cut off automatically um so so right now so I understand the substitute ordinance but in a waiting period but this don't have anything to do with if you don't need a zoning check do this count even if you don't need a zoning change if you need a ZBA also as

[Speaker 4] (1:59:23 - 2:00:01)
far as the petition with the clerk's office so the zoning change request may not initiate a cannabis review we may not know that a cannabis business establishment is proposed pursuant to a zoning change so this petition process though could be independent of any legislative action someone could start a petition process tomorrow in a precinct that may have no zoning ability today and no interest in the future in having a cannabis business that doesn't have to be an initiated application through the ZBA or through committee on zoning to start the petition process through the clerk's office they can be completely

[Speaker 3] (2:00:01 - 2:00:06)
separate from each other so this is a petition process to do what essentially

[Speaker 4] (2:00:06 - 2:00:15)
to establish the the local precinct as prohibiting a cannabis business okay so

[Speaker 3] (2:00:15 - 2:00:40)
like voting it dry correct voting is smokeless smokeless yes okay right all the business yes interesting so so but it gives us an opportunity to put to make an area correct or the community enough so who

[Speaker 4] (2:00:40 - 2:01:09)
can who can file the petition anyway anyone who's a resident of the precinct can file the petition if after the first 90 days the clerk's office deems that it is sufficient signatures and process wise then there's an additional 90 days for any legislative process through City Council so if that includes community meetings if that includes any other type of you know correspondences or whatever the local alderman may choose and then if they choose to go ahead with the ordinance through council that would be covered within the next 90 days so so

[Speaker 3] (2:01:09 - 2:01:42)
what is I mean just thinking because you know I'm panning right now because of this gold rush that's going on with all of these guys trying to open up these places and and now they're competing for spots in the same areas you know what would have would have your competition didn't want you close by him and they encourage somebody to start a petition to vote that precinct dry so you wouldn't be right across in the next precinct next to them you know what I'm saying

[Speaker 4] (2:01:43 - 2:02:11)
well I couldn't speak to somebody's business practice but there's no prohibition on someone starting a petition process provided that whoever is initiating it and then gathers the signatures are contained with our residents who are contained within whatever the subject precinct is so they would have to have complicit assistance I guess correct register voters of that precinct and that's what the clerk's office would be affirming after the 90

[Speaker 1] (2:02:11 - 2:02:21)
days and follow that thought if if the if approved by the clerk's office that

[Speaker 4] (2:02:21 - 2:02:37)
would then trigger an additional 90 days of ordinate applications couldn't proceed and that would be the time that there would be any additional community process or consideration of an ordinance through council to actually enact the

[Speaker 3] (2:02:37 - 2:03:04)
prohibition for that precinct so the ultimate has to be on board even though somebody else started the correct okay all the member boys so my question is that this will still require the signature process yes that's what would be the first 90 days mr. chairman what percentage of signatures do you need

[Speaker 4] (2:03:07 - 2:03:24)
let me I'll have to defer to radio to he's from the law department ready to

[Speaker 13] (2:03:24 - 2:03:33)
from the law department 25% of registered voters may sign 25 people or

[Speaker 3] (2:03:33 - 2:03:48)
25% 25% registered 5% of registered voters and then so what if what if you have a precinct that don't have any residents little more about I don't know

[Speaker 13] (2:03:48 - 2:03:54)
if that scenario came up technically that scenario wouldn't apply to this

[Speaker 4] (2:03:54 - 2:04:01)
situation I don't know how I I'm not certain how would be a precinct like I

[Speaker 3] (2:04:01 - 2:04:12)
get medical districts industrial areas okay go ahead all right other committee

[Speaker 1] (2:04:12 - 2:04:17)
members before we get down committee all of in doubt yes thank you mr.

[Speaker 26] (2:04:17 - 2:04:36)
chairman who is promulgating the is there like of some paperwork that outlines this process in terms of the information for the 35% has to be a registered voter

[Speaker 13] (2:04:37 - 2:05:00)
yes I think already the city clerk has made this information available in their website yeah this information is already on the clerk's website that's correct I'm ready to cast a for the record from the law department thank you thank you

[Speaker 1] (2:05:00 - 2:05:12)
all right other questions from committee members before we go to none okay all in Jason urban thank you mr.

[Speaker 18] (2:05:12 - 2:05:35)
chairman I just I think I had two quick questions number one we have by removing cannabis on-site cannabis consumption do we now revert back to the state statute as to what where cannabis can be consumed outside of a personal resident correct well I'm tired Patrick sure

[Speaker 4] (2:05:35 - 2:06:28)
Patrick Murray Department of Planning so by taking it by taking it out we are reverting back to what the state allows however the state also allows regulation by the local municipalities for this specific type of cannabis use so because we don't have those regulations finalized we felt it was advisable to remove the use entirely so that it is not you know someone someone in theory could come in tomorrow and request a special use to establish an on-site consumption facility and there are no regulations from a licensing or a zoning standpoint so where it can be established aside from a zoning district exclusivity within a particular building any type of relation to any type of other commercial sales so there were without those regulations it was far more permissive than we would otherwise have looked to do and so removing it

[Speaker 18] (2:06:28 - 2:06:47)
eliminates that gray area for now okay and then secondly the removal of 17 dash 14 0 3 0 3 dash I effectively does what so when Patrick Murphy again from the

[Speaker 4] (2:06:47 - 2:07:21)
Department of Planning when that original section was introduced it was prior to the state coming up with the additional 90-day waiting period the idea behind striking the language and replacing it with a more simplistic sentence is that we will now track whatever the state's requirements are in the future so if they adjust any of their notice or prohibition requirements or anything having to do with petition processes we will automatically have adopted that language without having to go through a revision to the text amendment so it's more flexible and immediately mirroring what the state

[Speaker 18] (2:07:21 - 2:07:54)
does okay my understanding previously of this particular portion would have allowed for if you I guess if you look at the newspaper you'll see that companies are iron locations and the way it was previously as I understood it if someone filed a notice of intent to circulate a petition to prohibit sales that effectively cut off that entire precinct from even accepting an

[Speaker 4] (2:07:54 - 2:08:34)
application is that correct no a rigid prior to today just by picking up a form from the clerk's office and saying informing the clerk that you want to initiate the process had no impact on any applications someone may take that as an implicit prohibition and they may choose not to because of you know externalities of having knowing that petition is out there but there was no legal requirement that that application for any kind of cannabis business be halted now with this change there would be a mandate that that be halted for 90 days which allows for that signature process to commence and be completed and

[Speaker 18] (2:08:34 - 2:08:57)
reviewed by the clerk's office so then this would do exactly what I thought the other piece would have done in essence yes correct so now if somebody comes in and says hey I want to do the the prohibition in precinct 12 precinct 12 is now off limits to any accepting any new application proceeding with an

[Speaker 4] (2:08:57 - 2:09:01)
application yes I mean in essence they can't do anything in that precinct for

[Speaker 18] (2:09:01 - 2:09:50)
90 days correct and if an application is then properly done 25% certified by the clerk that period is extended for another 90 days after certification to see if the action will take place legislatively by counsel correct okay so essentially this potentially as Alderman Tunney Chairman Tunney stated potentially gives a six-month delay or window of community input prior to a application even being allowed to move forward in a particular precinct correct okay that is all I have thank you much thank you Alderman other questions from

[Speaker 1] (2:09:50 - 2:10:58)

accordingly we request the committee's recommendation for passage and we'd be there's an adjacent lot yeah so the narrative and then putting in a new restaurant or a restaurant now needs a drive-thru well the narrative has

[Speaker 5] (2:16:30 - 2:17:04)
changed we're no longer putting a drive-thru into this location it's just going to be strictly a surface parking lot and it's an existing development with about three retail commercial spaces and a fitness center it's an L shape building and within that L there's a vacant lot we purchased that vacant lot and we're just going to create a surface parking lot to for the customers of the existing retail uses for example there's a Panera there so

[Speaker 1] (2:17:04 - 2:17:10)
our narrative correct me if I'm wrong this is Steve Valenziano Department of

[Speaker 6] (2:17:10 - 2:17:31)
Planning and Development originally the proposal was to include a drive-thru but working with the department and with the Department of Transportation the owners have agreed to just do a surface lot to serve the building especially those businesses that are immediately adjacent to Elson Avenue correct all right I'm

[Speaker 1] (2:17:31 - 2:17:43)
just reading the script and knowing restaurants a little bit is there an existing restaurant in the there's a Panera bread there so the original idea

[Speaker 5] (2:17:43 - 2:17:48)
Panera drive-thru or or what other restaurant might go there but yes Panera

I just want to commend everything they've done again this developer has a robust they have a robust hiring plan for the community to make it very diverse in their hiring.

[Speaker 1] (2:31:29 - 2:31:39)
Other questions? I just have one little question and this has to do with Chicago is Related doing Hudson, Hudson Yard?

[Speaker 3] (2:31:40 - 2:31:41)
Lincoln Yard.

[Speaker 1] (2:31:41 - 2:32:09)
No, no, New York. We've got some work to do in New York in regards to an article yesterday in the New York Times about promises made promises kept so I think this is going to be very important that the aldermen stay very close on this item. I know Related's got a great reputation there's no question about that but you know what was approved is a little bit different than what potentially was actually proposed to be.

[Speaker 3] (2:32:10 - 2:32:17)
Point of information? Yes. That Lincoln Yard article that was about you guys?

Hudson Yard.

[Speaker 11] (2:32:18 - 2:32:19)
Hudson Yards?

[Speaker 3] (2:32:19 - 2:32:26)
I didn't see the article to be honest with you but we are affiliated with with Related out of New York so.

[Speaker 11] (2:32:27 - 2:32:28)
Yeah it's right right next to the High Line.

[Speaker 3] (2:32:29 - 2:32:50)
Yeah I actually had the yeah I frequent the High Line whenever I go there. The development is is one of the things I like that you have a bathroom that you offer to the public in your building on the High Line because I was like walking there. They don't want a wall built.

[Speaker 1] (2:32:50 - 2:33:06)
That's right. They don't want a wall built. Alderman Dowell.

Yes thank you Mr. Chairman. I'm sorry I'm sorry this reporter needs to would you identify yourself for the record? Arnold Bernanke senior vice president of Related Midwest.

Alderman Dowell.

[Speaker 26] (2:33:06 - 2:33:33)
Yes thank you Mr. Chairman while I am here at the zoning committee I wanted to take the opportunity to ask Related Midwest what they plan to do with the townhomes that you all purchased in Dearborn Park 2 when you all were looking at the CTA owned property for the CTA station. What's the plan for the homes that you purchased?

[Speaker 11] (2:33:37 - 2:33:49)
Donald Bernanke Related Midwest. Alderman we don't have a plan just yet but we would be happy and obviously would communicate with you as we develop that plan. Do you have people living in those homes?

[Speaker 6] (2:33:50 - 2:33:51)
Yes we do.

[Speaker 26] (2:33:51 - 2:33:57)

[Speaker 33] (2:34:08 - 2:34:08)
Did we get the motion?

[Speaker 1] (2:34:08 - 2:35:35)
No we incorporated the record. Got too excited about this. All right so we did incorporate.

Okay so do I have a motion to pass this item? Alderman Capelman moves to pass on this item as revised. All those in favor?

Aye. And any opposed? Hearing none.

Ayes have it and congratulations I know it's a big project and it's essential this project this property if I'm not mistaken is vacant for 40 years so it is definitely a missing tooth and I'm sure that the exciting project and working with the free aldermen at least that surround this project so thank you and good luck to you. Thank you Alderman. Make sure you're gonna be talking to Alderman Dowell about those townhouses.

For sure. Wasn't that where this wasn't that where this was that where the station was gonna be? It was.

Okay all right now we're moving on to middle of page 16 item number 201 7a 25th Ward ordinance referred on September 18th of 19 common address to 2801 South Ashland Avenue and the change request is a plan manufacturing district number 11 sub area a to a waterway plan development. All right Mr. Moore.

[Speaker 6] (2:35:36 - 2:37:24)
Thank You Mr. Chairman and members of the committee my name for the record is Thomas S Moore and with me today is Mr. Lee Friedheim. Mr. Friedheim runs a Kugel Foods which has been in Chicago since shortly after the Civil War. He's about five generations now and he wants to continue it for his children for the next generation.

They're currently in the near West Loop and that location has become very congested and not necessarily conducive to the food processing business that they have so they found this new location working with the city they found this longtime vacant location near what's used to be called the bubbly Creek and they've worked with a plan that will dedicate 60 feet to public waterway walkway along the river and they have a wonderful plan to build a building that will increase the employment their employment over time and bring new jobs. They've done a study where most of their workers are nearer to that location than their current location so it will facilitate and be more convenient for their workers and it'll allow them to continue this business that's been in Chicago for well over a hundred years to continue.

We did appear in front of the Plan Commission in December and I would ask that that those proceedings be included into this proceeding.

[Speaker 1] (2:37:25 - 2:37:33)
Alderman Raboyas moves to incorporate the records from the Plan Commission. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Ayes have it and the plans are incorporated.

[Speaker 6] (2:37:34 - 2:38:11)
Thank you. We would also like to thank Alderman Siccio Lopez who has been very supportive and cooperative throughout this process and he did sponsor a community meeting where he also invited Alderman Thompson and the neighbors in the 11th Ward who live close to this location and we had a very well attended community meeting and we have Alderman Lopez's support and we'd ask for your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (2:38:13 - 2:38:17)
All right yes Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 3] (2:38:18 - 2:39:27)
Thank you very much Mr. Chairman. I would be remiss if I did not let Alderman Lopez know that uh one I hate to be losing them to you you know so taking one of my good companies me and Mr. Freheim have been working with each other for over 25 years now he's a he's a great business in the community he's very active he participate matter of fact he used to be very active in a community organization when we had all the meat markers there Randolph-Fulton Market Association just a good man and and in the his two children are even better all right he's done it he's done a good job of raising them and I think they're going to do a good job they're very conscientious about people and about the community and about their employees and they support the neighborhood so you're very fortunate to have him and I hate to lose him how long how long it's going to be before you a

[Speaker 2] (2:53:03 - 2:56:22)
all right we have we all right good afternoon now mr. chairman and members of the committee one last time for the record my name is Sarah Barnes and I'm an attorney with the lobsters of Sam Bank happy to be here this afternoon on behalf of the applicant 46 11 South Ellis LLC here with me today is Suad Mustafa he is the project manager for the applicants super excited about this proposal it has been about over three years in progress in regards to the st. James United the repurposing of the st.

James United Methodist Church which is located in North Henwood towards this end on the subject property is presently improved with a three-story church building which the applicant is seeking to preserve and to repurpose into and convert into a mixed-use building which will contain commercial cooperative office space and dwelling unit towards that end the grade level of the existing church will be converted into a cooperative office area where residents and business owners in the community can lease out office space and meeting space for the community as well as hold classes and seminars within the church building once rehabilitated it will contain a total of 25 dwelling unit with that in mind because the existing footprint of the church building expands almost the entirety of the site we were unable to locate any of the parking for the future residents of the building and the office users on this particular site however the applicant was able to acquire the parking lot across the street from this property and therefore we will be going to the Zoning Board of Appeals seeking a special use in order to locate all of our accessory parking across the street on the vacant parking lot with this in mind we have been working very very diligently with Alderman Sophia King as well as her Internal Zoning Advisory Committee and all of the residents of the North Kenwood neighborhood on this programing for this proposal for again just about three years towards that end we've had several community meetings we have had meetings with an adjacent homeowners associations and we're very very happy to report back that we have unanimous support from the group and the residents as well as the as well as Alderman King and towards that end Alderman King did tender a copy of a letter of support to the committee this morning we do have that letter and with that we'd be happy to answer any questions otherwise we just very respectfully ask for the approval of this committee here today questions from

[Speaker 1] (2:56:22 - 2:56:51)
committee members I have just a comment I mean it sounds like a really exciting project beautiful it's great to see what the building looks yeah I know go on our phone I guess but I think in terms of the presentation I know how much time Alderman King and the community have worked on it and it is an adaptive reuse and we know that a lot of schools and or churches are going through some transition and closing of stuff so be we would like to see those ideas as we work

[Speaker 2] (2:56:51 - 2:57:07)
with our communities too yeah absolutely and towards that end one of the I think most exciting aspects of this is the applicant is actually going to retain and preserve all of the stained glass that is in the church so that was

[Speaker 1] (2:57:07 - 2:57:17)
another consideration for the community and then what is this square footage of the so-called commercial space where isn't you know people can either it's

[Speaker 2] (2:57:17 - 2:57:22)
about 10,000 square feet yeah it's pretty significant so we think you can get

[Speaker 1] (2:57:22 - 2:57:29)
good meaningful space and then there is a public space too for meetings large

[Speaker 2] (2:57:29 - 2:57:45)
larger means so that space will be able to be divided up for community use as well so the the space will not be leased month to month and it'd be basically day to day it's like incubator space somebody wanted to come in there so yeah

[Speaker 1] (2:57:45 - 2:57:50)
it could be community anything well good luck I know it's a it's a complex to try

[Speaker 2] (2:57:50 - 2:57:55)
to put all that together a lot of moving a lot of moving pieces so we'll like I

[Speaker 1] (2:57:55 - 2:58:47)
said be before the zone congrats congratulations to Alderman King in the community because it's a it's a great that we're preserving and also reinvigorating okay a bottom of page 17 oh I'm sorry I get a motion Alderman wags back moves to pass on that exciting project all those in favor aye any opposed any chair the ayes have it and we report it out on Wednesday thank you all right now we're going to bottom page 17 number two zero zero six two second ward ordinance referred on June 12th of 19 common address is 1200 through 1212 North State and the change request from a b35 community shopping district to a residential plan development morning mr.

chairman the property the property is approximately 19,000 square feet it's at the northwest corner of division and state it's currently improved with a mix of commercial and office buildings our proposal is to establish a plan development with approximately 91 residential units 33 parking spaces and an overall FAR not to exceed 5.0 the applicant has worked closely with Alderman Hopkins's who is to our right and the community on this project made a number of changes as a result we can go into detail if you'd like but they include changes to the building facade the location of the residential tower and enhanced landscaping improvements there is a letter of support from Alderman Hopkins in the file and we are of course available to answer any questions should you have them we would respectfully request that you send this matter on to the to the City Council with a favorable recommendation thank you Alderman

[Speaker 14] (3:00:35 - 3:02:13)
Hopkins thank you mr. chairman is mr. quarter council for the applicant mentioned there were a number of significant changes to this program every one of them significantly improve this building so I would like to commend the development team the architect in the community we had two large community meetings and we had one community what would you call it an open house kind of charrette forum which was also very productive just to have a more freewheeling you know forum for feedback and participation which the community responded very favorably to and in the weeks after I was told that it was a format that people found very productive and certainly much less contentious it was an ability to offer constructive criticism rather than screaming and shouting which sometimes happens so all in all this is an excellent building we look forward to breaking ground you know we'll be working with the immediate neighbors as far as impact of the construction and the demolition schedule you know we're moving forward on that just when the good weather allows but I know the demo is going to begin shortly the only thing I would like to add is just a brief moment of silence for the late lamented five faces we're all going to miss that in the neighborhood it was a long time restaurant but absolutely there will be a new restaurant at some point and I am confident that the new tenants will be embraced by the neighborhood it will be certainly much more in character with the neighborhood and we look forward to seeing the lights on in the in the commercial space as well so nice job everybody I would move approval all right thank you Alderman other questions
