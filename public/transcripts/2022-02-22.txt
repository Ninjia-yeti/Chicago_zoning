there you go great thank you a minute there uh so my name is matt crawford i'm here with the department of planning and development i'm a historian with the department and i'm here to recommend on behalf of the commission on chicago landmarks that the seth warner house be designated as a chicago landmark it was built in 1869 before the chicago fire so it is one of the oldest houses in austin and one of the oldest in chicago it's also a very fine example of italian architecture the owners of the property james bowers and cynthia weaver have requested and consented to landmark designation the house is in the 37th ward and alderman mitt supports the proposed designation it is located in the austin community area near the border with oak park when this house was built it was located in a small farm owned by mr seth warner that occupied the entire block founded by central prime huron and ohio streets here's the house around 1900 this shows how neighborhoods like austin were unincorporated rural homesteads an important part of chicago's development history to understand that heritage another layer of heritage reflected in this house is that is that of musical culture from 1924 to 1979 this building housed a series of conservatories for classical music it provided musical education to 31,000 chicagoans mostly in the austin community area another important story told by this house is its association with seth warner he was one of chicago's earliest settlers in 1851 he built this hall right across from city hall it was warner's hall and he used this place to host speakers at meetings calling for an end to slavery and supporting the human cause during the civil war frederick douglas spoke here in 1853 so on behalf of the commission on chicago landmarks i recommend passage of the ordinance designating the seth warner house as a chicago landmark i'm here to

[Speaker 12] (31:09 - 33:05)
steve friedland on this one steven yes thank you thank you mr chairman my name again for the record steve friedland with the law firm of applegate and thorn thompson this is a request with respect to lincoln village shopping center which many of you are familiar with this is a technical amendment to this plan development the plan development was approved in 2001 uh at a time where that property incorporated some senior dwelling units along the chicago river and for whatever reason and frankly uh i wasn't around in 2001 when this was done and no one's really sure why the uses for the commercial portion of the shopping center were limited to only retail uses in the underlying b3-2 district now many of you are familiar with lincoln village it has always had non-retail uses like most shopping centers have it currently has a fifth third bank a north shore university health system a physical therapy center frankly my orthodontist was there i went there as a kid and that's where i had my orthodontist worked on so i don't know why it was it was left out of the ordinance and frankly it wasn't really noticed until last year when my client had a new tenant that was a non-retail tenant they went in and someone caught this at the city so the request is to include sort of the typical commercial uses that are in a b3 dash two district into this plan development there's nothing changing there's no construction it's it's simply to make sure that those uses which are there now are legal and other similar kind of commercial uses could go into lincoln village shopping center all right steven obviously

[Speaker 1] (33:05 - 33:48)
um seems non-nonsensical or that why it was this way uh let's hear from the department why did it take so long catch this one patrick sorry chairman i was just dealing with something else real quick so this non-retail uses in a uh in a retail mall in the 50th floor what why did this why did it take so long for us to catch this uh need for the change

[Speaker 20] (33:48 - 34:10)
are you working i can't speak to why things got approved from a licensing standpoint when they shouldn't have oh go ahead ana silent i i chairman i i can't i can't answer why why retail use has got approved when they should not have we've been talking with steve and working with this client for a number of months to get them straightened out for this pd and for a tenant

[Speaker 28] (34:10 - 34:58)
that they're looking for go ahead steve alderman is steve valenziano department of planning um so the retail uses are the permitted uses it's the office uses that are not permitted some of the uses that uh steve friedland had brought up are um not licensed by the city because they are state licensed and therefore do not require a city license so they were not caught when things come in that um do require cities um licensed then that's when we would catch them but i don't know why originally when alderman stone uh was the alderman here and uh this was created why office uses were left out at that time i have no idea all right thank you steve we do have a letter

[Speaker 1] (34:58 - 35:10)
of support from alder woman silverstein um okay we've got two steps here uh steve we have to we have incorporate the records from the plan commission yes i'm sorry we did go to the

[Speaker 8] (42:24 - 45:31)
record is tom moore and um this is on behalf of the wentworth ww wentworth properties llc uh really uh mr moy and his wife who run four other they call them play centers that's the zoning designation for him but what they really do is he picks up students mostly from the asian community at their school this particular facility would be just one block from the john haynes school and he brings them to the facility they give them a healthy snack they help them with their homework and then they have exercise games and educational games and the working parents can pick them up anywhere from after school time till about till eight o'clock at night and uh so um this particular school does not have one of these facilities and so mr moy um was able to purchase this empty vacant uh formerly uh industrial type building but it's it's in it's solid and it only needs some cleaning and decorating and can be used without any particular additions or structural changes and we went and saw the alderman the alderman asked us to reach out to there's really one huge um condo building across 24th street or 24th place i think it is and anyway we sent 270 letters out we had a zoom meeting um the um we presented uh what mr moy does um answered questions um there really there was absolutely no uh objections um and then of course we sent 270 letters out again to file uh and um i've had no uh no negative feedback whatsoever um and so um we would request uh this is a community benefit um and it helps the working parents in the area and we would request your support uh it is uh i was advised that since it goes from an m to a c uh we should file a substitute narrative and plans uh and make it a type one i did uh file those documents and so i'd ask that they be incorporated as well so alderman wagus back

moves to accept the substantive narrative plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum any objections to that hearing on the substantive narrative plans are accepted obviously mr moore you explained the process you had with the community um and have no objections i know we had sent the committee members a narrative of one page narrative on that so uh with that do we have any questions from uh committee members we'll do past chairman as amended alderman lopez all right uh alderman uh raymond lopez uh moves to pass by the same roll call that used to determine form any objections to the motion hearing on we're going to pass this item with the substantive narrative and plans thank you mr moore thank you very much um we top of page four and again in the 11th ward document number 20934 t1 in the 11th ward the ordinance was referred on january 26th of 2022 common address is 500 through 518 west 28th place aka 28 15 through 28 27 south wallace street and the change request from an m11 limited manufacturing business park district to a c15 neighborhood commercial district uh we have mark kupiak on this item mark alderman can you hear me now yes mark yeah i'm sorry i was not

[Speaker 2] (47:24 - 48:47)
promoted to a panelist okay well now you are okay thanks thank you very much for the record my name is mark kupiak i'm an attorney with offices at 77 west washington and i represent the applicant and i actually asked the applicant to provide their principal mao may and i believe mao is also on the call just in case the committee had any questions for the property 500 518 west 28th place and as you said there's currently zoned m1-1 and we would like to rezone it for information it's actually the old st anthony sacred heart church campus currently improved with a church and a rectory and an old school and a convent and we need to rezone it from the m1 district originally we put in put in a request to try to resolve some parking issues because the never had any on-site parking lot but the zoning department was good enough to clarify for me what our parking requirement is so i'd like to offer a substitute ordinance asking to rezone this to a b2 dash to this district i also submitted and filed a substitute narrative for the type one application so if one of your members would be good enough to accommodate me okay alderman hopkins so moves

[Speaker 1] (48:48 - 49:04)
okay so um the change request will be uh substituted out from an m11 limited manufacturing business park district to a b22 uh neighborhood commercial district that is the substitute

[Speaker 2] (49:04 - 49:36)
on that correct mark that is that is correct okay so and just for the record uh alderman uh the plan this was filed this is type one and the plans remain the same there was no change in the plans just the zoning district and again these plans are the same plans that we showed the community group at our last community meeting okay okay thank you very much and with that um um we had a extensive extensive community process uh the developer is actually hold on hold on hold on

[Speaker 1] (49:36 - 50:07)
a second first of all are we moving the substitute okay so alderman hopkins moves to accept the substitute by the same roll call that we do to determine form any objections to that hearing on the substitutes before us as mr kupiak said there are literally no changes uh with the plans itself but we are now under the b22 okay so uh anna robles you wanted to comment on that anna uh

[Speaker 31] (50:07 - 50:24)
i can hear you anna okay anna robles from gpd uh yes substitute ordinance plus a substitute narrative and plans no changes to the plans but the narrative had to be modified

[Speaker 1] (50:24 - 50:57)
based on the ordinance change okay so we did half of it now i'm asking alderman hopkins moves to accept the substantive narrative and plans for the type one application but the same roll call that was used to determine quorum any objections to that okay so the substitute narrative and plans are accepted and now we have a b22 underlying zoning anna are we good we're good chairman okay i proceed mark thank you very much um so mr chairman

[Speaker 2] (50:57 - 55:44)
as i mentioned this is uh an old catholic church campus improved now with the church directory the school and the convent and what we propose is an adaptive reuse of these church buildings church building and rectory school building for daycare and an adult activity center and for that we need this we need the zoning change the developer has been working for more than a year on this project uh planning it back in april of last year he finished his plans uh may of last year met with the alderman to show him the plans the alderman asked for a community meeting as this is custom a date was selected notice was mailed to the neighboring property owners on june 3rd we had our first community meeting and had a good response from the neighbors because the plan calls for preserving and reusing this beautiful old church so the neighbors were very supportive with the with the plan with the use one question was raised about parking the church and school campus never had any on-site parking lot so some of the comments at the meeting was that the project would be stronger if in fact we could provide some on-site parking i will mention at that community meeting i did have mao may on behalf of the applicant and actually mao has ivy garden learning center lined up to be the operator of the daycare center and the adult activity center and michael zhao from ivy garden was also present at the meeting to describe the proposed use so after that meeting the alderman suggested we perhaps respond to the community's concern about parking and the applicant went back sat down with his architect and changed the plan so the plan before you today calls for the demolition of the convent building and construction of a parking lot in the place of that convent and it would be a 20 car parking lot and that would be right at the corner of normal and 28th place so with that change the revised plan was sent back to the alderman the alderman did request a second community meeting so with the holidays and whatnot finally a date was selected and notice was again mailed out and we had a second community meeting just on january 11th and showed them the new plan with the proposed parking lot in place of that convent and the community response was very positive we're still saving the church they like the daycare center and we're very pleased that we did the on sacrifice to condon and provided the on-site parking lot so with that we filed our application and we're here before you today i'd like to make just a couple of points on behalf of the applicant i'd like to take notice not easy to find an acceptable reuse for an old church building if you look around the city i know st adalbert not too far from here they closed a couple of years ago had a lot of a lot of difficulty in finding an acceptable use on the north side years ago they got zoning permission at saint boniface to convert that church building to condos and i don't believe those condos are built even yet last friday at the our zoning board chicago public schools came in with a variation for the school building at saint cornelius parish on the north side interesting enough they were converting that school to a daycare use and they were adjusting their parking lot but they did not buy the church building so it's not easy to find a good use for a church building and here we have a developer who's going to use reuse and preserve this church building so it's a very good project number two for the developers sake happy to do the community process but very tough on the developer because the process is sometimes lengthy especially if one runs beyond his due diligence period and he's got to make a decision to do the closing and buy the property so at this point in time he's been working so long he was respectfully asked to be able to go forward one small point on this the reuse for a daycare center and adult activity center ivy garden actually has a daycare center now in in richport and they are full with a waiting list so on this particular project not only are we being fair to the developer but actually a very positive public benefit because we're providing needed daycare services a lot of talk about getting people back to work some people can't get back to work unless they have accessible daycare service public benefit to go forward at this time thank you mark okay thank you all right alderman osterman

[Speaker 32] (55:44 - 56:16)
has his hand up just a comment related to churches and this is more of a suggestion to the chair it would be good to get some good examples of adaptive reuses of churches across the city i've got a thing from preservation chicago about all the churches that are vacant increasingly more around the city and i think the city should come up with some good ideas proactively instead of reactively to work with the members of the city council to address this but just wanted to make

[Speaker 1] (56:16 - 58:19)
that comment that's all thank you thank you alderman osterman i do i do agree with you in just case in point there were four or five churches in and around the 44th ward service office in the 70s and most of them to be honest with you were adaptively reused for housing whether or not that's the highest and best use of them but certainly we these are some great architectural specimens and you know i know specifically with some of the churches they don't want to be classified as landmark so we've got to be a little bit more proactive on that so i appreciate your comments and trying to work with the department on adaptive reuse of these things all right other questions all right so can i get a pass for the same roll call that was used to determine quorum on this item alderman hopkins so moves alderman hopkins makes the motion uh move to pass any objections to the motion hearing none this item is passed as substitute substituted and with the substantive narrative and plans all right thank you very much uh mark and i know mark you've sent again to all the committee members the one pager on the narrative community process with this with this uh adaptive reuse all right thank you now we are in the we're going to skip to the middle of okay middle of page four we're skipping wards is what i'm saying we're on item number 20938 in the 50th ward ordinance was referred on january 26th of 2022 uh common address is 2910 west two-way avenue and the change request from an rs3 residential single unit detached house district to an rt 3.5 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit

[Speaker 2] (58:19 - 59:09)
district again mark kubiak thank you mr chairman mark kubiak attorney offices 77 west washington represent the applicant subject property 2910 west two-way an existing two-flat building and the applicant would like to rezone this property to convert the basement area to a third dwelling unit located on two-way which is a main arterial street met with the alderman at the alderman's request he asked for a community meeting virtual meeting was held no objections from the neighbors so the alderman advised us to go forward adding one unit total of three units in the building the existing building and with that i was advised that the alderman communicated her support to your committee hopefully and with that i would ask for your support

[Speaker 1] (59:11 - 59:34)
all right mark we do have a uh support uh from alderman all the woman silverstein uh my quick question what's the size of the lot because it's it seems to be must be an oversized lot with an r 3.5 for three units um a little a little bit but uh we can't do

[Speaker 2] (59:34 - 59:39)
the three units in the r3 and the r3 you're limited to a two flat oh i get that okay

[Speaker 1] (59:39 - 59:51)
but rt rt 3.5 is eligible for three units is the question yes all right all right and you do have

[Speaker 2] (59:51 - 1:00:09)
the size of the lot it isn't oversized and the uh the the 3.5 would uh suffice i think it's 30 i think we've got 37 50 square feet so i think the 3.5 gives us uh three units right on the head

[Speaker 1] (1:00:10 - 1:00:19)
okay um i my my chief of staff agrees with that uh summation uh anybody from the department no

[Speaker 31] (1:00:19 - 1:00:29)
problems with that uh chairman it's actually 49 73 square feet it does allow a three unit

[Speaker 1] (1:00:29 - 1:00:34)
okay well that's different than what mr kupiak said so now we're at almost 5 000 square feet

[Speaker 31] (1:00:35 - 1:00:44)
it's a 40 by 124 comes up to 49 73 he's fine okay thank you very much other questions other

any questions the committee has all right uh i'm gonna i'm gonna ask a question but i want to see any other hands up on this questions okay tim um just since i'm not i'm not visualizing this it's a 75 by 125 lot and mr uh mr ruffolo is going to build a new new large home in the front and connect it to the rear which has tell me about the rear that's going to be preserved

[Speaker 4] (1:08:57 - 1:09:44)
so the rear has um the brick two-story structure and that's across the back of the lot um that that's going to be that's going to remain the new house will actually be the i should say the just to clarify also uh the garage is at the uh is on the west side of the lot now in terms of this new residence that's going to be built if you will at right angles uh to the garage it will be on the north part of the lot so it will be somewhat of an l-shaped configuration does that help yeah i'm that that helps the l shape

[Speaker 1] (1:09:45 - 1:10:21)
especially since it's 75 feet of frontage okay um and i i know we've the committee members have seen the letter of support i think there's like 10 or so residents on the block that are are been been briefed and supported yes okay um is there any motion to um once this is all done to move it back or to the what is that was that a question the committee

[Speaker 4] (1:10:21 - 1:10:29)
had or the community had yes it was and the alderman indicated that we would bring it back

[Speaker 1] (1:10:29 - 1:11:50)
to the rt4 you privately will do that yes okay all right just want to double check all right any other questions from committee members move approval mr chairman all right uh that is uh no more questions then we have alderman hopkins makes the motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum any objections to his motion hearing on the item is passed all right thank you very much now we are on the middle of page five and this is document number 20918 t1 in the 11th ward ordinance was referred on january 26th of 2022 the common address is 526 528 and 530 west 41st street and the change request from all from an m23 light industry district to an rs3 residential single unit detached house district and we have paul kolpak on this item and uh committee members the next item is also going to be pretty similar uh change request but we'll start with the one on 41st street all right

[Speaker 3] (1:11:51 - 1:12:32)
so paul good morning mr chairman members of the committee my name is paul kolpak i represent the property owner and applicant file builders llc i would request a file the substitute narrative pursuant to conversation with the zoning department the purpose of the substitute narrative had nothing to do with the design of the building however they asked us to put in that we must comply with new section 17-2-0301c exceptions if required that we would seek a special use to comply with the air quality ordinance

[Speaker 1] (1:12:32 - 1:12:45)
uh and i would ask that that be uh accepted okay so paul since this is the uh first time that this is new to me so tell me a little bit about or the department uh can you explain

[Speaker 3] (1:12:46 - 1:13:31)
this yeah i've had conversations with i'll let mr murphy describe we've had conversations with murphy mr valenziano evidently the new ordinance requires anyone who is going within 660 feet of a m district to ascertain the licenses that are in that district and if they meet if they fall into the categories uh such fourth and added ordinance that we have to go in for use we're still trying to get a feel on how to comply with this uh and we will uh but that's

[Speaker 1] (1:13:31 - 1:13:37)
the purpose of patrick if i'm correct patrick you want to expound on that please yes chairman this

[Speaker 20] (1:13:37 - 1:14:11)
was the uh complementary component to the air quality ordinance from last year where additional restrictions were put on various intensive industrial operations to provide uh upfront information to c dot and uh department of public health on the flip side when certain sensitive uses such as this residential are proposed in proximities to these intensive industrial uses then a type one map amendment if it's triggered would also require a special use to be followed through with and so that's what uh all right so that's that this i don't

[Speaker 1] (1:14:11 - 1:16:00)
know that this is the first one that's come through but if they're very rare okay so that's that was the uh motion for the substantive narrative plans for the type one correct okay all righty um all right with that uh questions from committee members hearing none can i get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum move to pass chairman alderman wag is back hold on a second hold on to that before i do that i think i asked for the substantive narrative and plan okay my staff says we didn't so we got two things to go first of all we're gonna we're gonna alderman wag is back moves to accept the substantive narrative plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum any objections to that okay so the substantive narrative plans are in front of us and with that alderman uh wag is back makes the motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum any objections neither okay uh no objections this was this item will be passed with the substantive narrative and plans all right now we will now move to the next item mr popak you're still on the line because as i said to committee members this is uh basically a repeat of what we just discussed uh and we will read it into the record item number 20917 t1 in the 11th ward ordinance was referred on january 26th of 2022 common address is 543 west 40th place and the change request again from m23 light industry district to rs3 residential single
