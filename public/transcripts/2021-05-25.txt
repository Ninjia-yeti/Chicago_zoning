[Speaker 1] (4:01 - 4:24)

Good morning chairman. Good morning.

[Speaker 18] (4:30 - 4:31)

[Speaker 1] (4:43 - 4:47)

[Speaker 40] (4:53 - 4:54)
Hold eyes.

[Speaker 21] (4:55 - 5:28)
Kamal, may I ask, every time I've logged in for Zoom meetings, the last few committee meetings, the warning about being recorded comes on. Is that a new feature? Yes, alderman.

It's a new feature since the last update on Zoom. They just started doing that and there's no way for me to turn it off. Okay.

Causing problems already.

[Speaker 1] (5:29 - 7:43)
All right. The May 25th, 2021 Committee on Zoning Landmarks and Building Standards is called to order. Pursuant to applicable law, the chairman has determined that an in-person meeting is not practical or prudent.

Accordingly, attendance at this meeting will be by remote means only. We'll start off with the roll call. Committee members, please unmute yourself and please note that your yes or present response will be deemed to be a yes vote when this quorum call is used as a reference vote for later items.

We'll now move on to the approval of rule 45 report containing the minutes of the April 20th 2021 hearing of the committee on zoning landmark and building standards. All members of the committee should have received a copy of the report electronically and if hearing no objections, do I have a motion by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum to approve the minutes? So moved Alderman Lopez.

Alderman Lopez makes that motion. Any objection to the motion? Hearing no objection, the report has been approved.

All right. Moving on. We will now hear the items to be deferred.

I'll read the ward, the file number, the address and page number. Take a motion for all at the end. Let's see.

Who is it? Yes.

[Speaker 12] (9:51 - 9:53)

Any objections to his motion? Hearing no objections, these items have been deferred. We have three public speakers signed up for today's meeting, so we'll start with...

[Speaker 3] (13:26 - 13:28)
Alderman Burnett is here.

[Speaker 1] (13:28 - 13:56)
Alderman Burnett is on for the roll call. All right, all right, so we'll start. Lupe Izari, I should know this name.

Lupe, first public speaker. Chairman, I don't see Lupe. We'll take a hold on Lupe and then we'll move to Marilyn May.

[Speaker 12] (13:56 - 14:01)
All right, so you need to give them another chance.

[Speaker 1] (14:03 - 14:06)
Hello? Yes, could you identify yourself, please?

[Speaker 25] (14:07 - 17:01)
Yes, good morning, Chairman, and good morning to all the committee members. My name is Marilyn May, and I am once again representing the Black Heroes Matter Coalition. And I'm back to implore that you all vote yes to Alderman Moore's Historic Ordinance to Rename Outer Lakeshore Drive to Jean-Baptiste Pointe de Sable Drive during tomorrow's full city council meeting.

And most of you know that it is the right and necessary thing to do. But to those who are still a bit hesitant, I challenge you to just chill, relax. It's okay to go against the status quo.

It's okay to turn things around. It's okay to rename Outer Lakeshore Drive to De Sable Drive in honor of Chicago's founder, a Black man. Did you know that more than 40% of the people that live in Chicago are Black and brown?

And contrary to what you've been conditioned to believe about Black and brown people, we are not second class. We are not subpar. Nor are we problems.

We are professors, proprietors, prodigies, protectors, prophets, and priests. We are profound, prolific, and productive. De Sable was prosperous, progressive, and prominent.

He established this city. And there is nothing derogatory or problematic about the man or the name Jean-Baptiste Pointe de Sable. And so there should be no problems renaming Lakeshore Drive.

It's okay to rename Outer Lakeshore Drive to De Sable Drive. The cost of doing so is minimal compared to the overall long-term impact this righteous act will have on this city. Chicago needs some positive, uplifting news.

Your yes vote will show Chicago in a different light. And yes, renaming Outer Lakeshore Drive to De Sable Drive is a symbolic act, as some have said. We've said it, in fact, over and over again.

But it's needed. Just do it. And listen, I'm confident that everything else that the Black and brown people of this city needs will follow.

You'll make sure of that. So vote yes to De Sable Drive tomorrow. Rename Outer Lakeshore Drive to Jean-Baptiste Pointe de Sable Drive.

And remember those other initiatives for a full city holiday, as well as the funding and building of a 25-foot monument in De Sable's honor. May God bless you all and keep you. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (17:01 - 17:18)
Thank you. Our next speaker, Roberto Grau. Let's try it again.

Roberto Grau, G-R-A-U.

[Speaker 27] (17:19 - 17:20)
Good morning.

[Speaker 37] (17:27 - 17:28)
Goodbye.

[Speaker 1] (17:31 - 17:33)
Roberto, are you there? If so, mute your...

[Speaker 27] (17:34 - 17:35)
Yes, I'm here.

[Speaker 1] (17:35 - 17:37)
Okay. Would you proceed, please?

[Speaker 27] (17:38 - 20:30)
My name is Roberto Grau, and I'm the owner of the building at 1336 North Claremont. A building constructed in 1887. Still a beautiful building.

I bought this property in 1983. My wife and I moved in in 1984, 37 years ago. The building was in need of repairs.

The housing court put a long list of building violations. It took time, money, and many trips to the building department to get the building out of the housing court. I also had to deal with a fire one Sunday in December 2006 that damaged the second and third floors, forcing my tenants to move.

Good people, good tenants. Like many other communities in the early 80s and early 90s, Claremont was a rough street with shootings, drugs, and gang warfare. But we stayed.

And with time, things got better. And Claremont became what it is now. A nice, quiet street with dedicated and concerned residents.

I've dedicated many years to my building on the 1300 block of Claremont Avenue. I've seen many of the changes that have taken place and are taking place now. My children attended the Diego School.

My wife died here in 1996. One thing is very clear in my mind. How these 38 new apartments will affect my daily routine and my quality of life.

The level of stress will increase, no question about that. The alley behind the building is the busy one with utility trucks and trucks picking up junk and metal. We already have the distraught traffic from the Diego School.

There are times when you are trying to exit your garage and it gets to be very difficult when parents drive through the alleys to look after their children in order to save time. Sometimes one car after the other. Having many cars, like the ones from the proposed 38 apartments, will only compound the problem.

Day and night, cars coming in and going out on a daily basis, this will make it dangerous. For at any moment, a car can drive by and crash your car as it exits the garage. It is stressful to become a prisoner in your own garage, especially when you need to go somewhere or are wanted someplace.

Sometimes less is better. 38 apartments is just too much. Again, less is better.

This is one occasion. Thank you very much. Have a great day.

[Speaker 1] (20:32 - 20:35)
We'll do one last call for Lupe. Is Ari?

[Speaker 12] (20:42 - 20:44)
Not here, Chairman. Okay.

[Speaker 26] (21:03 - 21:04)
Mr. Chairman, you are on mute.

[Speaker 1] (21:07 - 21:34)
That's what you get when you do it yourself. All right. Let's start.

First off, document number 02021-1410, the landmark designation of the Pentecostal Church of Holiness located at 4208 West 15th Street in the 24th Ward. We have Daniel Clyburn here from the Historic Preservation Division of the Department of Planning and Development to present the matter. Dan?

[Speaker 32] (21:36 - 21:45)
Good morning. Can you hear me okay? Sorry, you can hear me okay?

[Speaker 1] (21:48 - 21:49)
Yep, we can hear you, Dan.

[Speaker 32] (21:49 - 23:51)
I see your lips moving, so okay. Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. I'm here today with a proposed ordinance for the landmark designation of the Pentecostal Church of Holiness, formerly Our Lady of Lords, located at 4208 West 15th Street.

24th Ward Alderman Michael Scott is in support of the landmark designation as well as the Pentecostal Church of Holiness, the current owner of the building. To orient you, the Pentecostal Church of Holiness is located in the North Lawndale Community Area on Chicago's west side. The church anchors the northwest corner of the intersection of Keeler Avenue and 15th Street.

At the February 2021 meeting, the Commission on Chicago Landmarks found that the Pentecostal Church of Holiness met three criteria for designation, including criterion one for its significance to the City of Chicago as a neighborhood church that has served as an important part of cultural life in Chicago's Czech and later African-American communities, criterion three for the contributions of Bishop Michael Dempsey to both Our Lady of Lords Parish and to the needs of North Lawndale residents during the 1960s and 1970s, criterion four is a finely crafted example of neighborhood scale ecclesiastical architecture executed in the Romanesque Revival style, and finally, the Commission also found that the Pentecostal Church of Holiness meets the separate integrity criterion.

DPD staff have received support letters for the designation from at least 56 community area residents and or parishioners of Pentecostal Church of Holiness, as well as U.S. Senator Richard Durbin and U.S. Representative Annie Davis. As I stated earlier, Alderman Scott is in support of the designation and Pastor Sean Johnson from the Pentecostal Church of Holiness is here today to speak in support of the designation. Therefore, Historic Preservation Division staff recommends passage of the proposed ordinance and has identified the significant features to be identified as all exterior elevations, including roof lines of the building.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (23:55 - 24:03)
Thank you, Daniel. We also have Pastor Johnson of the church. Would you like to speak on this matter, Pastor?

[Speaker 12] (24:04 - 28:02)
I would. Thank you so much for this opportunity to speak to you, to Chairman Tunney and the entire committee. Thank you again for allowing this to even come so far.

Before I begin, please allow me to give my appreciation to the vision of preserving and investing in historical spaces to our mayor, to Commissioner Cox, to Commissioner Wong and the entire commission of Chicago on landmarks. With the support of Senator Durbin and Congressman Benny Davis and our Alderman Michael Scott and the entire North Lawndale community at large, we request that tomorrow there is a vote in favor for granting Pentecostal Church of Holiness its landmark status. And I'll be short, but according to a 2012 US Catholic.org article entitled The Fight Over Fighting Poverty, Auxiliary Bishop Michael Dempsey, who was a former pastor of our historical church, had gone door to door in his poverty-stricken parish and asked how many people are willing to invest in their community. And that's the same thing that we are doing today. And it's the same thing that we have been praying for since we have taken over the church. And God has allowed us, he has allowed us to, at this particular time, have our mayor and our aldermen and those who really are invested in our community, the North Lawndale community, to have this facilitate Invest Southwest.

And so we want to ensure that those who hear about North Lawndale will know that there is a lily in the valley. There is beauty in what seems to be degradation. We want to ensure that those who know about North Lawndale and hear about North Lawndale are there, that they dispel the myths of the poor, dispel the myths of our community, and that they are able to see something beautiful within our community.

Because we hear so much, so much violence going on, but it is a beautiful community, a thriving community, and we are excited. We are excited about what God is doing through the use of you and others to create this to be a landmark. We know that when the Lord had answered our prayers and there was an intentional focus on this historical building, we know that there are necessary repairs.

However, through our Renaissance campaign and through our community involvement with such organizations like St. Anthony, like Faith in Place, like our governmental community organizations, we know we can help dispel the myth of the poor. And Bishop Dempsey's National Recognized Program, Lawndale for Better Jobs, LBJ, and its continued fight for equity will not go unnoticed. We know that we have a historical building.

It favors the Romanesque revival and architectural styles of architecture that the famed Louis Gensel put together and built. I want to preserve it. We want to preserve our history and demonstrate, prove, and show to the community that we are vested in our neighborhood and that I ask each and every one of you to vote tomorrow.

Thank you for this opportunity, Chairman Tunney and the entire Aldermanic staff. God bless you.

[Speaker 1] (28:03 - 28:37)
Thank you, Pastor. Before we get to vote on tomorrow, we get to vote on today. All right.

Do we have any questions by committee members? I know we have the Alderman's support on this. Can I get a motion to move, do pass, but it's the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Alderman Cardona do pass. Alderman Cardona moves to pass. Any objections to that motion?

Hearing no objections, the item is passed and as pastor will be referred to the full city council tomorrow. Have a great day. Thanks.

[Speaker 12] (28:38 - 28:39)
God bless each and every one of you.

[Speaker 1] (28:40 - 29:16)
All right. Next, we have, we will hear large signs over 100 square feet in an area, 24 feet above grade. We'll we'll hear them all together.

I'll read the ward followed by the address and take a motion at the end. In the third ward, 2105 South state street, two signs in the 11th ward at 741 West 31st street and three signs in the 14th ward located at 4620 South Pulaski road. Any questions by committee members?

Can I get a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

[Speaker 12] (29:16 - 29:18)
Move to pass.

[Speaker 1] (29:18 - 30:51)
That was Alderman Dahl. Moves do pass. Objections to her motion.

Hearing none, the orders are passed. We'll now move on to the regular agenda in an effort to minimize technical difficulties and ensure the committee meeting runs as smoothly as possible. The typical order in which items will be heard has been updated throughout the duration of virtual committee on zoning meetings.

Items will be grouped together according to witness attorney and be heard in that order rather than the ward order. Now, while I say that, there'll be a couple exceptions to that. We'll start, we'll start, I believe with Alderman Coleman in the 16th ward.

We'll hear, I believe we have to hear her motions or her ordinances separately. And then while we're with her, we'll go on to a private application with her. So we'll go, that will be the first out of order exception.

And then secondly, we have Alderman Riley on the state of Illinois building. We're going to move to Alderman Riley's ordinance after we hear from Alderman Coleman. So that being said, we're on page one, document number A8619, 16th ward ordinance was referred on February 26th of 21.

And the common address 1114 West 59th street. The change request RS3 residential single unit detached house district to C11 neighborhood commercial district. Alderman Coleman.

[Speaker 30] (30:54 - 31:24)
Thank you, chairman Sonny and to zoning committee. This is Grow Greater Englewoods. They're doing an amazing job with a small business vendors that will be growing.

There's a winery, there's crafting, there's some great healing products along those, I believe there are four lots along 59th street, as well as 5822 South Halsted. So I asked for the support of this committee for Grow Greater Englewood.

[Speaker 1] (31:27 - 32:21)
Separately, because there are different addresses and some of them, even while they're all C11 zoning. So stay with us, but on the application, A8619, 1114 West 59th street. Any questions for the alderman?

Can I get a motion do pass by the last Alderman Lopez. Alderman Lopez moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to the motion?

Item is passed. Hearing no objections. All right.

Next, document number 862, Aldermanic 8620 16th ward ordinance was referred on February 26th of 21. This common address 5800 South Ada street. Change request M11 limited manufacturing business park district to C11 neighborhood commercial district.

Alderman Coleman.

[Speaker 30] (32:24 - 32:44)
Same organization at 5800 Ada, Grow Greater Englewood, I believe in neighbor space. They're out there doing the work now, taking vacant lots and making it a beautiful space that small business vendors will be able to contribute to the neighborhood.

[Speaker 1] (32:45 - 32:48)
Thank you, Alderman. Questions for Alderman Coleman?

[Speaker 26] (32:51 - 32:52)
Again, move do pass chairman.

[Speaker 1] (32:52 - 33:26)
Okay. No questions. We had a motion by Alderman Ray Lopez to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections to the motion? Hearing none, this item is passed. Let's see.

Document number A8622 16th ward ordinance was referred on 226 of 21. Common address 5822 South Halstead street. And this change request M11 limited manufacturing business park district to C11 neighborhood commercial district.

Alderman Coleman.

[Speaker 30] (33:27 - 33:28)
Same as stated before.

[Speaker 1] (33:30 - 33:41)
All right. Sounds like this is for the Grow Englewood, right? Yes, chairman.

All right. Any questions for the Alderman?

[Speaker 15] (33:42 - 33:44)
Same goes for me too. Move do pass.

[Speaker 1] (33:45 - 34:45)
Hearing no questions, Alderman Ray Lopez moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to his motion? Hearing no objections, the item is passed.

Now, Alderman Coleman, we are going to go out of order. As I said in my preface, we're on the page 14, top of page 14. And this is document number 19986 16th ward ordinance was referred on March 13th of 19.

And this common address 6048 through 6058 South Halstead street 800 through 810 West 61st street 801 through 811 West 61st street and 6100 through 6136 South Halstead street. And the change request is a B22 neighborhood mixed use district to a residential plan development. Scott Borstein.

[Speaker 36] (34:48 - 35:40)
Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, Scott Borstein from the law. Milan Leroy, here on behalf of kvk development. I just there is a substitute.

So I just want to add and we've gone through the plan commission process. So let me just preface that the new address and the substitute ordinance are for 801 through 11 West 61st, and 6100 through 6136 South Halstead. So that's that's for this particular site.

And there was a substitute ordinance that we put in. The matter was heard before the plan commission last week. And of course, we would request that all the findings and recommendations of the plan commission, including the substitute be incorporated into the record here today.

[Speaker 1] (35:41 - 35:47)
So Alderman Roboius moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine harm.

[Speaker 40] (35:48 - 35:49)
Oh, move, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (35:49 - 35:55)
Any objections to the motion? Hearing none, the records are incorporated. Continue Scott.

[Speaker 36] (35:55 - 36:19)
Thank you. So I we have our team here to present and I so I would like if possible to introduce first tissue Germany from kvk who can just briefly talk about kvk and then we can just quickly move through the presentation because I know the Alderman does have to go. So if we can do that, that'd be great.

[Speaker 38] (36:23 - 37:09)
Thank you, Scott. Thank you, Alderman Tunney. And thank you, Alderman Coleman, for hearing us this morning.

My name is Tisha Germany. I am a vice president and special assistant to the CEO for kvk enterprises. Our company kvk is doing business currently in six cities around the country.

And we've done about a half a billion dollars worth of commercial development. And we're very excited today to be presenting this project to you. We've been in Chicago for a few years, working with the community and working with Alderman Coleman on this project.

And we are very excited to present it to you today. I can hand it over to Chris Lee from Johnston Lee architects and he can take you through the design.

[Speaker 15] (37:10 - 40:48)
Thank you. My name is Chris Lee. I'm an architect with Johnston and Lee.

We are a 38 year old firm based in the south loop. Our project is approximately a block and a half away from the business district of 63rd and Halstead. It's shown graphically bordered by red.

We are adjacent to the Halstead street bus, as well as a block away from the 63rd street bus line, as well as the 63rd and Halstead green line station. We are adjacent close to the Englewood square retail and just west from the Nicholson specialty school. Next slide, please.

The property is indicated in red on this slide, showing a sub area A, which is the site which we will be building upon. Sub area B is for a later phase. Next slide, please.

Next slide, please. We plan to actually leverage the momentum of the southwest, the invest southwest effort that Mayor Lightfoot has undertaken in order to make sure that the vitality that Halstead once enjoyed as being years ago, the second business district in Chicagoland. We hope to revitalize that level of energy that Halstead as well as 63rd street had.

Next slide, please. These are aerial views of the site. The upper left hand corner is just showing the building looking from the northeast.

On the upper right hand corner, we're viewing the site from the looking towards the northwest. Our building is actually indicated with the windows and the building in back of it is actually phase 2 of the project. In the lower right hand corner is a view looking towards the southwest.

And then the lower left hand corner is a view showing the Halstead elevation of the phase 1 project. Next slide, please. Our context is we have no context.

All the sites on the site as well as surrounding the site is vacant. Next slide, please. Next slide, please.

This is the main elevation that you see is the Halstead street elevation. The building is five story building containing 56 dwelling units. The first floor is primarily glass and brick.

Floors 2 through 5 are glass and metal panels with sun baffles. Next slide, please. The next slide is the 63rd Parkway perspective.

In the upper right hand corner, you can see what it appears to be currently. But again, the first floor is masonry and glass and the second through fifth floor is glass with metal panels.

[Speaker 1] (40:48 - 40:54)
Scott, Scott, my staff tells me you've got about 20 slides. So you might want to do the clip note version. Okay.

[Speaker 36] (40:55 - 41:00)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chris, let's just quickly go through.

[Speaker 15] (41:00 - 41:58)
Okay. Next slide, please. East elevation of the building.

Next slide. This is west elevation of the building. Next slide.

The south and north elevations of the building. Next slide, please. Next slide, please.

This is the landscape plan showing subarea with the proposed building at the corner of Halstead and 63rd Parkway with parking in the rear. We have 22 parking spaces and 44 bicycle spaces. Next slide, please.

We have 40 of the 56 units will be set aside as affordable. 16 of the 56 units will be market rate. Affordable units are based on the area median income.

Next slide, please. Tisha?

[Speaker 38] (42:01 - 42:22)
Sure. We're proposing about 50 construction jobs in addition to permanent jobs on the residence. As Chris mentioned, there will be some flexible space of about 1,000 square feet right on the corner.

We will be enhancing the landscaping, sidewalks, and lighting in this area. And it's about a $20 million total development cost.

[Speaker 36] (42:24 - 42:28)
Thanks, Mr. Chairman. That does conclude our presentation.

[Speaker 1] (42:30 - 42:44)
All right. So we have a question or a comment from Alderman Burnett. And then we're going to hear from Alderman Coleman.

We'll start with Walter. Walter?

[Speaker 3] (42:48 - 44:44)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to commend my colleague, Alderman Coleman, on this project. And I just want to recognize her for taking the initiative to use an affordable project to prime her community for more development.

You know, some folks don't understand that if you have an area where the market is affordable, that in order to get new things to come to the community, you have to utilize government resources to make something happen and to potentially have an impact on the property value. Right now, it's challenging on the west and the south sides because it costs more money to build than you can sell property for or rent it out for. But by using government subsidies in order to make it happen, it primes the community for other private developers and private land to be developed in the community.

You have a community where most of the things are affordable or low income, you need to mix it up. Like I always try to say, I'm very pro-affordable housing everywhere, but I don't want all affordable housing anywhere. So you have to mix it up in order to have a viable community and to attract the amenities to that community because businesses look at the demographics of incomes in the neighborhood.

So I commend Alderman Coleman for having a vision and not being afraid to make something happen in her community and I congratulate her and I support this project. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (44:46 - 44:52)
All right, thank you. Alderman Coleman, the floor is yours.

[Speaker 30] (44:52 - 46:09)
Thank you, Chairman Tunney and to the KBK team. I know Kathy Brown and Chris and Tish, you all are on here. You know what, Alderman Barnett, Commissioner Barnett and the Planning Commission side, you said it best.

Sometimes we have to take this leap of faith to bring the market and the housing market in order for more development to come. One day, the 16th Ward is going to have as many development and new projects as the 27th Ward and Chairman, under your leadership and your advice, more commercial, more commercial. This project also builds on Englewood Square.

Some of us know about the Starbucks and the Whole Foods and Chipotle one block south and also mirror Lightfoot's vision for really investing southwest. This also stops the exodus of African Americans and give those that are committed to Englewood another option when our children come home from college that they will have beautiful housing, quality housing to come to and those 16 market rates. So thank you to the committee, Chairman Tunney.

Thank you for your leadership and I hope for a favorable vote and response.

[Speaker 1] (46:11 - 46:41)
Thank you, Alderwoman. Congratulations on this and I said it at the Planning Commission that we'd like to see more commercial. If you know as well as anybody, that was one of the busiest intersections for commercial activity.

So hopefully this will be the start of a lot more economic development and business development in your ward. Congratulations. So if there are any other questions by committee members, do I hear a motion to pass by the same roll call that it's usually?

[Speaker 29] (46:42 - 46:43)
Sawyer moves to pass.

[Speaker 1] (46:43 - 47:35)
That's Alderman Sawyer moves to pass as revised. Any objections to the motion? Hearing no objections, this item is passed as revised.

Congrats, Alderwoman. All right, now we are, let's see, fourth item on page two. As I said, we're gonna just go a little bit out of order with document number A8639, 42nd Ward.

Ordinance was referred on February 24th of 21. The common address, everyone should know this by now, 100 West Randolph Street. Change request, business plan development number 270 to DC16.

That's a downtown core district. Alderman Riley.

[Speaker 16] (47:35 - 51:12)
Thank you, Chairman Tunney. This zoning amendment is rather simple. It just returns the property to its previous zoning designation of DC-16, its original classification, which as we know is typical of the zoning designation of neighboring properties.

I introduced this ordinance at Governor Pritzker's request as the state of Illinois is now seeking to market the property for future sale. The state is actually in the process now of vacating its offices there. This zoning amendment is the important first step that we need to take in order to restore the original zoning rights to the property so that the state of Illinois can market the property for sale to a private interest.

A little history here, why we have to go through this exercise. In 1981, for some unknown reason, my predecessor, Alderman Notaris, down zoned the property while the Thompson Center was still being built and cut the total development rights on the property in half. In fact, the existing building there today is currently noncompliant with its current zoning designation.

To be clear, this amendment simply restores the property's original zoning rights to a DC-16. This amendment does not approve a new project, nor does it allow for the demolition of the current property. Any new development or redevelopment of this site will be subject to planned commission approval and a regular zoning review and approval processes.

Clearly, the Thompson Center was designed by famous Chicago architect Helmut Jahn, and the building has enjoyed a rich history in downtown Chicago. And in fact, it's worth mentioning, I had spent time with Helmut Jahn discussing potential adaptive reuses for this building, and I would encourage developers to strongly consider those. That said, the Thompson Center is currently costing Illinois taxpayers nearly $17 million a year in maintenance and operating costs.

Taxpayers can no longer afford this building. So, the Thompson Center is a state property that is property tax exempt currently. That also is costing Chicago taxpayers more than $20 million in lost property tax revenue every year.

Redeveloping this site, whether by preservation, adaptive reuse, or new construction, would end its tax-exempt status and bring this entire city block back onto the city tax rolls. It's important to remember that any potential adaptive reuse of this site, so for those folks in the preservation community who would like to see that happen, this site would require more floor area ratio, or FAR, above and beyond its current DC-8 classification that's allowed under the PD. Adding FAR to this site by restoring it to the DC-16 is one of the only hopes preservationists would have to save the existing building, as adaptive reuse would require more FAR and density on the site for it to be economically viable.

If we don't restore the original zoning rights, demolition of the property is likely a foregone conclusion. This amendment provides potential buyers with more options, including adaptive reuse. Chairman and fellow committee members, I want to thank you in advance for your favorable consideration, and if there are no questions, I would make a motion do pass.

Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (51:12 - 51:35)
Thank you, Alderman Riley. We have any questions? Hearing no questions, Alderman Riley makes a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections to his motion? No objections. No objections.

The item is passed. Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 16] (51:35 - 51:36)
Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (51:37 - 51:48)
All right, now we're going to get back on the order of business. We are on top of page two, number eight.

[Speaker 26] (51:50 - 51:56)
Yeah, this is Roberto Maldonado. We are starting on yours, sir.

[Speaker 1] (51:57 - 52:17)
We're on page two. We'll read it. A8631, 26th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on February 24th of 21. Common address is 3239 West Division Street, and the change request to B12 Neighborhood Shopping District to a B11 Neighborhood Shopping District. Alderman Maldonado.

[Speaker 26] (52:18 - 52:43)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. On the following two items, it would be the same request of changing the zoning from a B1-2 to a B1-1. I don't know if you would like to take them all as the group, or do you want me to repeat the same argument three times?

[Speaker 1] (52:43 - 52:51)
We're going to have to. Legal says we got to do it individually. They're different addresses.

So we'll do the 3239 West Division first.

[Speaker 26] (52:51 - 53:57)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for hearing my request. This request is to change the zoning from a B1-2 to a B1-1 to give and provide consistency with the rest of the majority of the zoning on that strip. And as always is the case, this does not preclude any future owner of that land or future developer to request another zoning change.

But at that point, it's always good for developers to come before the community and share with them what they are aspiring to do and reach an agreement with the community, whoever future developers may want to do there. I ask that your committee with your leadership support this zoning change.

[Speaker 1] (54:01 - 54:09)
All right. Alderman, are you finished with that application, sir?

[Speaker 26] (54:10 - 54:12)
I finished with the A61.

[Speaker 1] (54:12 - 54:25)
We have questions for committee members on the 3239 West Division. No questions. Do I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 4] (54:26 - 54:27)
So moved. Alderman Hatton.

[Speaker 1] (54:27 - 54:56)
That is Alderman Hatton makes that motion. Any objections to our motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Now we'll move on to document number A8632, 26th Ward. Ordinance was referred on February 24th of 21. This common address 3259 West Division Street.

Again, the change request B12 Neighborhood Shopping District to B11 Neighborhood Shopping District. Roberto, it sounds like it's the same reasoning.

[Speaker 26] (54:57 - 55:00)
Yes, absolutely. You want me to repeat it or you want to?

[Speaker 1] (55:00 - 55:03)
No, I'll ask if there's questions from committee members.

[Speaker 26] (55:03 - 55:03)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (55:04 - 55:09)
Basically land use and planning, giving the community an opportunity to weigh in on future development.

[Speaker 40] (55:09 - 55:12)
No questions. Move for us to pass.

[Speaker 1] (55:12 - 55:43)
Okay. No questions. That's Alderman Roboius moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections to the motion? Hearing none, the item is passed. And next we'll do Alderman 8633, 26th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on February 24th of 21. Common address 3922 West North Avenue. And the change request B12 Neighborhood Shopping District to B11 Neighborhood Shopping District.

Alderman Maldonado.

[Speaker 26] (55:45 - 55:55)
Yes, it is absolutely the same argument. So if you want to hear my argument again that I made for 8631, I'm more than willing to do so.

[Speaker 1] (55:56 - 56:30)
All right. Let me see if any of the committee members have questions on this one. Hearing none, Alderman Roboius makes a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the item is passed. Now, Alderman Maldonado, as a courtesy, you have only one other item, I believe on the bottom of page three, on West Rice Street.

Is that correct? Which one?

[Speaker 26] (56:31 - 56:31)
What's the address?

[Speaker 1] (56:32 - 56:34)
2449 West Rice Street.

[Speaker 26] (56:34 - 56:37)
Yes, I did submit a letter of support.

[Speaker 1] (56:37 - 56:43)
What we'll do is we'll just quickly hear that since that's the only other item in your ward. Okay.

[Speaker 26] (56:43 - 56:43)
Yeah.

[Speaker 1] (56:44 - 57:11)
Okay. So let me read it into the record. Committee members were on the bottom of page three, document number 20668, 26th Ward ordinance was referred on April 21st of 21.

Common address 2449 West Rice Avenue. And the change request, RT4 residential two flat townhouse to an RM4.5 residential multi-unit district. And in this case we have attorney Tom Moore.

[Speaker 6] (57:14 - 58:39)
I am trying to get here. You're on. Oh, I am on.

Okay. Thank you. All right, Mr. Moore. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name for the record is Tom Moore. On this case, we have a family that has literally lived on this block for 50 years and owned this particular house, this three flat since 1984.

The children went to the Chopin school across the street and now they're adults and have their own families. So one of them lives on the first floor. The mom and dad live on the second floor and the other brother lives on the third floor.

And it's a 1907 three flat that has, you know, eight by 10 bedrooms. So the only request here is to be able to add a larger bedroom and a bathroom on each floor. And because of the shortness of the lot, in order to do that, they need to go from an RT4 to an RM4.5. And we had a meeting with the alderman and we've sent notice to the neighbors and talked to many of the neighbors and we'd request your support.

[Speaker 1] (58:44 - 58:47)
Roberto, do you want to just make a quick comment on this one or not?

[Speaker 26] (58:47 - 59:25)
Yes, I did. I did meet with the family. I know the family for several years.

It is true, you know, that the original, I mean, owner has lived there for over 30 years and he raised his kids there. They happen also to live, it's a multi-generational home. And so therefore they need, it's great when you see families, longtime residents wanted to expand their existing homes so that they can stay in their neighborhoods in which they have called home for over a generation.

So I fully support this zoning change.

[Speaker 1] (59:28 - 59:40)
Thank you, Alderman. Any questions for the applicant or the alderman? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 39] (59:41 - 59:43)
Do pass, Alderman Cardona.

[Speaker 1] (59:43 - 59:51)
Alderman Cardona makes that motion. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Thank you, Roberto. Have a good day.

[Speaker 26] (59:51 - 59:58)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Have a good day. All right.

[Speaker 1] (1:00:01 - 1:00:05)
I like when you guys speak when I don't know what you're talking about. I'm not too excited about that.

[Speaker 29] (1:00:06 - 1:00:08)
They said how handsome you were chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:00:10 - 1:00:53)
I'll change my mind. Olvidate, yo te quiero mucho. Oh, but I know what that is.

That's pretty scary. All right. Now we have a little hiccup here.

We're on the bottom of page two and I'll read it into the record is Aldermanic 8617 43rd Ward. Ordinance was referred on November 16th of 2020. Common address is 1810 through 1820 North well street and the change request.

We want three neighborhood shopping district to be to two neighborhood mixed use district. And when we're going to hear from Patrick Murphy, why we're going to have to defer this item. Patrick Murphy.

[Speaker 35] (1:00:54 - 1:01:22)
Sure. Chairman, I talked to Nicole a little while ago in the alderman. It appears as if a significant portion of the properties within the notice boundary were properly captured by the title search, but notice was not mailed to those property owners.

We'll be going through the pin list this morning. There seems to be a significant amount of parcels. And some of them are almost immediately adjacent to the subject site.

So it appears as though notice is going to have to be redone for this item.

[Speaker 1] (1:01:25 - 1:01:46)
All right. That's not good news. I know that Alderman Michelle Smith has been made aware of this.

So I'm going to ask for a motion to defer this item until the next zoning committee meeting. Can I get a motion to move Mr. Chairman? All right.

Before we take the vote, Alderman Michelle Smith.

[Speaker 20] (1:01:46 - 1:01:50)
First of all, thank you for the quick work by the zoning people today.

[Speaker 12] (1:01:50 - 1:02:01)
We did get a few calls and emails from residents today. And when we looked at the list, somehow there was an error in the notice. So of course we would like to defer it.

And I appreciate the motion from my colleagues.

[Speaker 1] (1:02:01 - 1:02:02)
All right.

[Speaker 12] (1:02:02 - 1:02:02)
So thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:02:03 - 1:02:49)
All right. Let's repeat the motion to defer. This item was made by Vice Chair Roboyas.

Any objections to the motion? Hearing no objections, this item will be deferred until the next meeting. Correct Alderman Smith?

Right. We'll do it one meeting. Yes.

One meeting. Okay. Great.

All right. Now we're on the top of page three in the 50th Ward. Document number A8635.

50th Ward. Common address is 2509 through 2527 West Devon Avenue. Change request B25 neighborhood mixed-use district to a B12 neighborhood shopping district.

Alderman Silverstein.

[Speaker 20] (1:02:49 - 1:03:13)
Good morning, Chairman and committee. This property, as you know, is currently a B25. It was upzoned in 2007.

At that time, the contractor had two years to build on there. They never did. The property is still vacant.

And we want to put it back down to a B12 upon zoning's recommendation.

[Speaker 1] (1:03:16 - 1:03:34)
All right. Questions for the Alderwoman? I'm sure we'll be back with a new development at some point.

I hope so. And with that, can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that we choose to determine quorum?

[Speaker 15] (1:03:34 - 1:03:36)
So moved, Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 1] (1:03:36 - 1:03:43)
Alderman Ray Lopez makes the motion. Any objections to the motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

[Speaker 20] (1:03:44 - 1:03:44)
Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:03:45 - 1:04:19)
All right. Now we're going to be middle of page three, document number 20667, 1st Ward. Ordinance was referred on April 21st of 21.

Common address is 1317 to 1335 Northwestern Avenue. And the change request is a C12 neighborhood commercial district to a B33 community shopping district. And I believe, committee members, this was the one Mr. Ramos, I believe, on the public comment period opined on this one.

[Speaker 38] (1:04:20 - 1:04:25)
And committee members have received a petition with 38 signatures.

[Speaker 20] (1:04:25 - 1:04:27)
Okay. And a few letters of opposition.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:27 - 1:04:47)
Okay. And so they've had a petition for how many individuals? 38.

Also in the negative. And a few handwritten letters also, right? Okay.

So with that being said, the change request, C12 commercial district to B33 community shopping district.

[Speaker 6] (1:04:47 - 1:06:35)
Tom Moore is the attorney. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. This is a case that's been through a long history.

The previous aldermen supported a similar zoning change. This is a former used car lot. And four or five years ago, a similar development was proposed.

It went through a community meeting and it was passed, but it was never built. So when Alderman La Spada came in, he found it unbuilt and he down-zoned it back to the C12 like it had been before that proposal. Our team came then and tried to revive the same building, but went through two different community groups and made many changes as we went.

Probably had 15 different meetings and came up with this revised plan, which is smaller than the one that had passed a few years ago. It's 38 units. There'll be six affordable units in it.

And it, after the many community meetings, and then the ward had a community meeting and eventually with, again, some changes, the alderman has supported it and we request your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (1:06:38 - 1:06:41)
Did we have an amendment to a type one? Is that correct?

[Speaker 6] (1:06:42 - 1:07:18)
Yes. So I'm very sorry to not have mentioned that. We had filed within a substitution, but that's technically not correct because this was just filed as a regular zoning change.

So we don't need a substitution. We need an amendment because of course the alderman after all these changes and the revised plan wants this to be a type one so that the developer builds what has been approved. And so our request is to amend it to a type one.

In other words.

[Speaker 1] (1:07:18 - 1:08:08)
All right. So with that, I'm going to ask vice chair Roboius moves to amend the application to a type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to the type one application amendment?

Okay. So hearing none, it is now pass as amended to type one. All right.

So with that, do we have questions from committee members on the application itself? And we do based on the substitute, the amended T one is the support of alderman LaSpada. So we have is, is, is he on?

Oh, okay.

[Speaker 37] (1:08:08 - 1:08:08)
Daniel.

[Speaker 8] (1:08:09 - 1:08:09)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (1:08:10 - 1:08:13)
Alderman LaSpada. You want to speak on this item on Northwestern please?

[Speaker 8] (1:08:14 - 1:10:57)
Sure. I can speak briefly on this. So I, I really appreciate the comprehensiveness and thoroughness of the community process that we had around this for the developer and Mr. Moore being really responsive participants in this. The development that we're talking about is kind of on the border of two different neighborhoods. So we have them meet with the Wicker Park committee. We have them meet with the East Humboldt Park Neighborhood Association, both of whom did community review of this development.

They gave feedback that feedback was incorporated into the development and both of those organizations wrote letters of support. It's adjacent to a school at Day Diego who confirmed to me that they do want to see development that helps more families move into and stay in the community. And I know from talking to our neighbors who live across the alley from this development.

So this is on Western. We've heard from a lot of neighbors on Claremont, their concerns that were mainly related to congestion issues that they thought would be tangential to this development. And to that end, we have submitted a traffic study CDOT that we are working with to understand how can we mitigate this congestion?

The developer has agreed to do loading zones in the front of the property to take care of deliveries or concerns related to commercial vehicles coming in and out. The development is going to have its recycling and garbage receptacles actually inside the property. So they're not making space on the dumpster.

We also committed to them. They were concerned about parents from Day Diego who either walk through or park in the alley when they're dropping kids off at school. We agreed to talk about that.

We've tried to address as many of these tangential concerns as we can, but at the end of the day, I do believe we did a really comprehensive review. I think the properties are valuable. I particularly think the six affordable home ownership opportunities, which based on previous prices in our community are going to be priced around 208 to 225,000.

And as we learned from an ordinance we passed earlier this year, are going to be kept affordable most likely for more than 30 years. This is a real benefit to the community. And so I'm glad to speak to my support for this proposal, but also to answer any questions my colleagues may have.

Right.

[Speaker 1] (1:10:57 - 1:11:04)
So with that, I think Alderman Mike Rodriguez has a question or comment, Michael. Sure thing. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 35] (1:11:04 - 1:11:35)
And thanks Alderman Espada for the explanations there. I do have just a couple of questions for you, Alderman, or whoever makes sense to answer them. I did hear some concerns about alley congestion.

I know you just mentioned a traffic study. I know in a conversation we had, we had discussed like you didn't think it would be a good idea to do increased curb cuts on the streets. And what's the traffic, what's the survey state about that alley congestion?

That seems to be a big concern of folks.

[Speaker 8] (1:11:36 - 1:13:13)
It was a big concern, but I think it may have been based on unrealistic senses of how many cars are going to be generated by this property. So with it's 38 units, there's going to be 32 parking spaces. There were those who were suggesting that this would lead to between 70 to 80 new cars in the community.

I don't think that's actually likely to be the case if only based off of the census data that we're seeing on actual vehicle ownership in our community. But there were those who believed that we should create new curb cuts or curb cuts kind of like what they had when this was a car dealership to have traffic coming in off of Western. This seemed unwise from the perspective of this is a bike route.

It's a high use bus corridor. We're anticipating more pedestrian traffic. We did not want to create more opportunities for crashes.

And also, there's no other development, no other mixed use development that has the kind of curb cuts that some residents were asking for. So based off of what development looks like on Western, based off of my experiences talking to folks like with CDOT and Active Transportation Alliance, that did not feel like the wise or safe choice in terms of how we would route traffic for folks who are coming into park at this development.

[Speaker 35] (1:13:14 - 1:13:37)
And then could you say a bit more around the affordability aspect? My understanding is that six of the units will be kept affordable from what I read. And could you say a little bit about the affordable pricing?

There was some issues from the folks who spoke out against this around that piece.

[Speaker 8] (1:13:39 - 1:15:18)
Certainly. So this development is within the existing Milwaukee Avenue pilot program, which means 50% affordable units have to be developed on site. They have to be priced as affordable to folks making 100% AMI and below.

These are going to be two and three bedroom units. And of course, it can be hard to find the right comparable. Sometimes it can be hard to get an accurate sense of it.

But just down the street from me at Fullerton and Campbell, there are affordable home ownership, two bedroom units coming on right now that are going to be priced at $208,000 without parking or $225,000 with parking. If we're looking at prices that are going to be similar to that, and I expect that we will be, those are decently affordable opportunities for home ownership in a ward like ours. Particularly as I would note, those units then go into the Chicago Community Land Trust.

They are kept affordable through limited increasing equity for at least 30 years. And based on the ordinance that we passed earlier this year, if the original buyer of the property sells his or her unit within the first 30 years, that term of affordability restarts. So you and I will be older and grayer before these units ever stop.

[Speaker 1] (1:15:18 - 1:15:30)
Well, you and Mike can take this conversation at nauseam forever on affordability, but I appreciate your answers to the comment. Mike, do you have any wrap up on this?

[Speaker 35] (1:15:31 - 1:15:36)
I know I'm getting the hook there, Chairman. Thank you. No, that's nothing further.

Take care. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:15:37 - 1:16:43)
All right. Any other questions? All right.

With that, can I get a motion to move to pass on the amended application by the same roll call it was used to determine quorum? So moved, Mr. Chairman. All right.

That is Alderman, Vice Chair Roboyas makes that motion to pass as amended. All those in favor? Any opposed to the motion, I should say.

All right. Hearing no objections, this item is passed as an amended to the type one. Thank you both.

And all right, now we will go to the top of page four and we are document number 20666, 37th ward ordinance was referred on April 21st of 21. Common address is 1118 North Pulaski Road. Change request RS3, residential single unit detached house district to an RT3.5, residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district. Again, Tom Moore is the attorney on this one. Mr. Moore.

[Speaker 6] (1:16:44 - 1:18:00)
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name for the record is Tom Moore.

And in this case, I'm representing Blanca Esposa and her husband, Carlos. They are a Spanish speaking couple who bought what they thought was a two flat, what looks like a two flat. It quacks like a duck.

It was a duck, except the city says it was a single family only building. We went and explained their plight to the, when they went to get a permit to improve it, they found out that the city believed it was a single family only. We went and explained their plight to Alderman Mitts and she supported their change to allow them to have the two flat to be an RT3.5. They hired an architect, they submitted plans and with your support, they'll be able to have the two flat they paid for.

[Speaker 1] (1:18:02 - 1:18:44)
Thank you, Mr. Moore. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Mitts. Any questions for the attorney?

Hearing none, Alderman Cardona moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Bottom of page four, document number 2063719 Ford ordinance was referred on February 24th of 21. This common address, 1841 through 1855 West 95th street. Change request B11 neighborhood shopping district to C11 neighborhood commercial district.

Mr. Moore.

[Speaker 6] (1:18:45 - 1:20:24)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is a little strip of commercial buildings and there's an empty storefront here or actually double storefront where a lady named Dawn Foster, who has a very interesting profession she's developed. She does a massage therapy for particularly women, but anybody who has had surgery like breast implantation or tummy tucks as they call them.

Anyway, to get rid of all the flabby skin and to tighten it all back up and return people the surgery site to looking normal again. She's been practicing this. She has a state license and she's been practicing this for some years and would now like to move to this location.

We went through a process in the 19th ward. We met with our committee and then there were some questions and some explanation needed. The alderman then had a community-wide Zoom meeting that went one evening for some time and then a follow-up where we answered more questions.

After all of that, we do now have the support of Alderman Matt O'Shea and we appreciate your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (1:20:25 - 1:20:48)
We do have a letter of support from Matt O'Shea. I don't know if I'm going to ask for questions on this. I'm a little nervous about asking for questions, but I will.

It sounds like there was a robust process in the 19th ward on this item, but yes. Oh my gosh. I'm afraid to ask.

Raymond Lopez. Okay. You're up, buddy.

[Speaker 5] (1:20:48 - 1:20:58)
You can all take a deep breath. Relax. I actually just wanted to commend Tom for the delicate nature in which he described the goings on of this business.

[Speaker 1] (1:20:59 - 1:21:00)
That would be Mr. Moore.

[Speaker 5] (1:21:01 - 1:21:02)
What did I say?

[Speaker 1] (1:21:03 - 1:21:05)
You said Tom and just make sure it's not the chairman. Okay.

[Speaker 16] (1:21:05 - 1:21:09)
Not you, Tom. Great job.

[Speaker 1] (1:21:09 - 1:21:11)
I would be clumsy on this one.

[Speaker 16] (1:21:11 - 1:21:14)
And I'll leave it at that before I get us all in trouble.

[Speaker 1] (1:21:14 - 1:21:34)
Any other questions? Can we quickly get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? And I know Vice Chair Roboius makes that motion to move to pass.

Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the item is passed. All right.

[Speaker 6] (1:21:34 - 1:21:36)
Thank you very much. Thanks, members of the committee.

[Speaker 1] (1:21:36 - 1:22:02)
All right. Top of page five. Document number 20687.

12th ward. Ordinance was referred on April 21st of 21. Common address 3595 through 3599 South Archer Avenue.

And the change request. C12 Neighborhood Commercial District to B23 Neighborhood Mixed Use District. Let's see.

What do we have? Do we have Mark or Agnes on this?

[Speaker 11] (1:22:02 - 1:22:04)
We've got Mark Koopiak here, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:22:05 - 1:22:07)
Okay, you want to proceed on this item in the 12th ward?

[Speaker 11] (1:22:07 - 1:22:33)
Yes, I do. Thank you very much. Again, Attorney Mark Koopiak.

I'm the attorney for the applicant. Subject property 3595-99 South Archer. Before we begin one procedural question, I'd like to amend the application, amend the application to a type one application and proceed on a type one application with the narrative and plans that we had delivered to the zoning department.

[Speaker 1] (1:22:34 - 1:22:48)
All right. So Alderman Cardona moves to amend the application to a type one by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to the motion?

Hearing none, we are now passed as amended to the type one.

[Speaker 11] (1:22:48 - 1:23:50)
Thank you. And the zoning change would allow the applicant to build a mixed use building, commercial underground floor, 27 dwelling units on the upper floor. I'd like to mention that this is a transit serve location directly across the street from the orange line station at Archer and Leavitt.

For this application, the applicant met a couple of times with the Alderman, then at the Alderman's request, a large community meeting. After that community meeting, again, at the Alderman's request, met with the McKinley Park Development Council and throughout that process did in fact make some changes to the design of the plan in response to comments that were made. And in the end, got the support of the Development Council and we have the amended plan that was submitted with the type one application.

And I believe you have a letter from the Alderman indicating his support.

[Speaker 1] (1:23:52 - 1:23:55)
We do have Alderman Cardenas on the call.

[Speaker 11] (1:23:55 - 1:23:56)
Oh, even better.

[Speaker 1] (1:23:56 - 1:24:15)
I believe. Alderman Cardenas on this application in South Archer. Might've stepped away.

Mark, do you have a letter of support in your file?

[Speaker 11] (1:24:17 - 1:24:19)
Um, we, I believe we do have a letter of support.

[Speaker 1] (1:24:20 - 1:24:29)
All right. All right. We do have one on the next one on Christiana.

What about Archer?

[Speaker 11] (1:24:30 - 1:24:38)
Uh, I, I believe we, I believe we do. And I thought that, um, it might've been sent to the committee, but I think we could, we could resend that if, uh.

[Speaker 1] (1:24:38 - 1:25:21)
Yeah. Why don't you, why don't you resend it? Um, and what we'll do is I'll take a motion to pass this item with the acknowledgement that we will have received, uh, the positive affirmation of, of Alderman Cardenas.

Cause I believe, I believe you when you say it, but, and it might be just lost in, lost in, in the, in the delivery, but we'll get it. Is that him? All right.

So, can I get a motion to move to pass, uh, on this item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Let's go. So move.

Let's go.

[Speaker 26] (1:25:21 - 1:25:21)
So move.

[Speaker 1] (1:25:21 - 1:25:36)
That is Alderman Roboyes moves to pass. Any, any objections to his motion? Okay.

The item is passed, Mark. Uh, you know, that, uh, that will be delivered to our office today or we'll hear directly from Alderman Cardenas on this motion.

[Speaker 5] (1:25:37 - 1:25:39)
Chairman, I mean, sorry, I joined a little bit late.

[Speaker 1] (1:25:40 - 1:25:55)
Oh, all right, George. Uh, we just, uh, took a motion on, on 3595 South Archer, but that was only incumbent upon getting, uh, the positive recommendation that we think you are ready to deliver to us.

[Speaker 5] (1:25:55 - 1:26:04)
That is correct. That is correct. I am sorry.

I just, I could not get in there. Uh, I wholeheartedly support it.

[Speaker 37] (1:26:04 - 1:26:05)
Okay.

[Speaker 5] (1:26:05 - 1:26:15)
Alrighty. The TOD development that, uh, we've been working on for a little, a little, a year and a half, almost two years. Great.

We got it to a point where the community accepts it and, uh, is ready to go.

[Speaker 1] (1:26:16 - 1:26:56)
Okay. Just like, as you say, well, let, let's get it done. Right, George?

That's exactly. All right. So Alderman Roboyes moves, uh, do pass by the same roll call that you used to determine quorum.

Any objections? So move, Mr. Chairman. All right.

No objections. Uh, this item is passed and, uh, we're going to move to the bottom of page five. Also in the 12th ward, this document number is 20690.

The ordinance was referred on April 21st of 21. Common address is 2502 South Christiana Avenue. And the change request RT4 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district to B3, one community shopping district.

Mark.

[Speaker 11] (1:26:57 - 1:27:49)
Yes, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. My name is Mark Kupiak.

I'm the attorney for the applicant, uh, for this property 2502 South Christiana. Subject property is a vacant lot, but it's adjacent to an existing restaurant, popular restaurant by the name of La Catedral cafe and restaurant, which is actually named for a cathedral in Guadalajara operated by chef Ambrosio. Um, the restaurant's existing given the pandemic, the weather, the summer they'd like to have an outdoor patio.

So we'd like to rezone this empty lot from our residential to a business zoning district. So they could develop the outdoor and the applicant himself had contacted the Alderman work with the Alderman explaining the situation and had asked the Alderman for his support.

[Speaker 1] (1:27:58 - 1:28:01)
We have, uh, Rodriguez with the question.

[Speaker 35] (1:28:02 - 1:28:09)
Oh, I just wanted to say great project. Uh, they're a great entity in the neighborhood. They're right down the street from my ward.

So good job, George moved to pass.

[Speaker 1] (1:28:10 - 1:28:12)
All right. Any other questions? I just, I will.

[Speaker 5] (1:28:13 - 1:29:04)
I'm exactly at my things on this item. I would say I'm not in zoning, but I want you guys to know that, uh, you're welcome to let me eat. They're a little village.

This place is it is like Cathedral. It's a, if you enter everything to do with the cathedral, it's almost like you're, you're in a church except you're going to eat. Um, and it's phenomenal.

It's mostly breakfast, phenomenal place that has been growing, uh, for the last few years and adding a patio to it. So on top of just being in the inside, now you can have a meat on patio. Yeah.

His expansion plans are, are, are huge. Uh, another parcel we'll come back to that later, but, uh, I encourage anyone that loves, um, Chilaquiles, uh, to come to 2,500 South Christiana in the heart of the little village, uh, and, uh, get a full sum of, of great Chilaquiles.

[Speaker 35] (1:29:04 - 1:29:05)
It's just a great place.

[Speaker 1] (1:29:07 - 1:29:51)
Thank you, Alderman. Um, so, uh, Alderman Rodriguez makes the motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to his motion hearing on the item is passed.

Congratulations. All right. Now we're on the middle of page six, document number 206, 8, 8 40th ward ordinance was referred in April 21st of 21 common address, 56, 42 North Ashland Avenue.

And the change request from an RS three residential single unit detached house district to an RM 4.5 residential multi-unit district. Uh, Mark, your Mark is still on board.

[Speaker 11] (1:29:51 - 1:30:45)
Yes, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mark. I'm the attorney for the applicant 56, 42 North Ashland.

And this particular project, the property is currently improved with an existing old building, not in good condition. The plan is to demolish that demolish that existing building and build a new four story for dwelling unit building, very similar in size and shape to the building next door adjacent to the North. Uh, 40th ward, we went through the Alderman's community process, submitted our plans, which I believe he put online and communicated to the neighborhood.

Then we did have a community meeting at which we described the project and answered the questions. And after the community meeting followed up with the automatic staff to ask for his support. And we ask now for yours.

[Speaker 1] (1:30:47 - 1:30:56)
Um, we do have a letter of support from Alderman Vasquez. Um, he's not on the call, correct?

[Speaker 37] (1:30:56 - 1:30:56)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:30:57 - 1:31:21)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Vasquez. Any questions for the applicants? Hearing no questions, can I get a motion move, uh, do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

So moved Mr. Chairman. Vice-chair Roboyes makes that motion. Any objections to his motion hearing none of the items?

Yes.

[Speaker 12] (1:31:21 - 1:31:23)
All right, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:31:24 - 1:31:25)
Yes.

[Speaker 11] (1:31:25 - 1:31:38)
Procedural question. These are case right before that. The first item on page six, it was deferred.

That one was deferred. Okay. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:31:38 - 1:32:00)
All right. Bottom of page six, document number two Oh four, two, one 14th ward ordinance was deferred on June 7th of 2020. Common address is 3330 to 3356 West 51st street change request.

M one, two limited manufacturing business park district to M two, two light industry district, Mark.

[Speaker 11] (1:32:01 - 1:33:15)
Thank you. My name is Mark Kupiec. I'm the attorney for the applicant for this property, 3330 dash 56 West 51st street.

The applicant actually has an existing auto body in the corner on Christiana. And he's operated that auto body shop business for about 13 years at that location in a garage type building. It's probably 40 years old.

During the 13 years, he's kind of outgrown his current site and the subject property. That's a subject matter of the zoning change would allow him and provide for additional outdoor vehicle storage and outdoor vehicle parking, parking, especially as a little pipe there, because you've got houses on Christiana and there is a residential zone parking outside the residential zone. Some of the other street spaces are taken up by commuters who walk to the 49th and Kedzie orange line stop.

So this zoning change for this particular property would allow the owner to continue his existing business and actually get along better with the neighbors. So he had spoken with Alderman Burke and staff to ask for Alderman support.

[Speaker 1] (1:33:19 - 1:33:29)
All right. Well, we do have Alderman Burke on the, on the line. Alderman Burke, did you want to comment on 51st street, please?

[Speaker 6] (1:33:32 - 1:34:00)
Yes, Mr. Chairman, this business has been here in the neighborhood for many, many years. They're ably represented by a council who is familiar with the neighborhood and his representations can always be relied upon. I'm, I'm pleased to endorse this change and hope that this neighborhood business will continue to prosper and thrive.

[Speaker 1] (1:34:01 - 1:34:48)
Thank you, Alderman. Questions for the Alderman or the applicant? Can I get a motion to move to pass on this item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

Alderman Cardona makes that motion. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

All right. Thank you. All right.

Top of page seven, document number 20679 T1 second ward ordinance was referred on April 21st of 21, common address, 1645 North well street change request be one three neighborhood shopping district to be two three neighborhood mixed use district. Bernard Citron.

[Speaker 22] (1:34:49 - 1:37:28)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, Bernard Citron of the law firm of Thompson Coburn. We are today representing the applicant to this property 2020 well street LLC 2020 well street LLC purchased this property some time ago and actually have begun a rehab on this existing building. We filed for a zoning change as a type one rezoning because we do not intend to number one, make any significant changes to the exterior of the building.

In fact, the only true exterior change was removal of a one story cooler building at the rear of the property. Their intention is to rehab the building, which is what they've been doing. The building was originally constructed with retail along the ground floor and 12 residential units above.

As people are well aware in these commercial districts, leasing up the retail has become far more difficult even before COVID and since COVID it is becoming worse and worse. So what they're seeking to do through this zoning change is to solely add two residential units on the ground floor. Now keeping in mind that this is well street, they will still maintain a commercial use on the ground floor facing well street, but there's no way to lease out the entire first floor for retail.

They've tried and they just had no luck and they just don't see that happening in the future. So again, we will still maintain the commercial street wall on well street, but would ask for this zoning change solely to add the two residential units. So we'll go from 12 units to 14 units.

Now being a type one, we are seeking to do so without adding additional parking. This is a TOD development, so we meet the standards for TOD. So we are allowed to ask for that change.

And to be honest with you, there's no place to add any parking because there is no public alley at the rear of this property for them to access any type of parking on the property. There is a neighboring building that does have what was a parking lot or is a parking lot next door that does have parking spaces that are available to lease. So if any of our tenants want to lease those spaces, they will be able to do so if they so choose.

With that, we're stand ready to answer any questions that the chairman or the committee members may have.

[Speaker 1] (1:37:31 - 1:37:50)
Questions for the applicant. Bernie, I just have one quick question. 1645, what's the size of the lot?

It looks like a lot of units for, I don't know what, maybe very deep. I don't know. No alleys.

[Speaker 22] (1:37:50 - 1:37:58)
There's no alley. It is a very deep lot. I believe it's a hundred.

I'm trying to look at the survey that's there.

[Speaker 1] (1:37:58 - 1:38:05)
But it's a 25 feet frontage. Is that correct? I can't read it myself actually.

[Speaker 22] (1:38:05 - 1:38:09)
Let me pull up the survey of this property. I apologize.

[Speaker 20] (1:38:14 - 1:38:17)
It's 32 by 153, Alderman.

[Speaker 22] (1:38:17 - 1:38:30)
So that's an oversized lot and we're actually not seeking to maximize the density under the dash three. We're only adding the two units.

[Speaker 1] (1:38:30 - 1:38:34)
All right. Alderman Hopkins on this application. Brian?

[Speaker 22] (1:38:34 - 1:38:39)
Do we have?

[Speaker 9] (1:38:40 - 1:40:23)
Yeah. Am I unmuted? All right.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm in full support of this application. The 1600 block of North Wells is arguably the most important block in Old Town's historic commercial district.

This is a good addition. I've been spending an inordinate amount of time there actually in the past couple of months. This is directly adjacent to the site of the second ward pop-up vaccination clinic we've been running since April in the former Treasure Island space at 1639 North Wells.

So I had an opportunity to familiarize myself with both the footprint, the intended use and the ongoing renovations. If you think back just a couple of years ago, this section of North Wells directly across the street from Second City was vibrant, bustling. You know, it was fully occupied.

Unfortunately, with the departure of Treasure Island and that vacant space and then the vacant space here in the building that was in a somewhat degraded condition with numerous code violations, right in the center of the 1600 block North Wells was just unacceptable. The community review process will be starting soon for what to do with the Treasure Island space, but it would be good to have this space immediately adjacent to it resolved prior to that. And as Mr. Citron mentioned, the code violations have been remedied and the renovation is well underway. This is necessary for this section of North Wells. I'm in full support of it and I'm not aware of any objection from the immediate neighbors or any of the community associations on record and I would urge and I vote on a do pass motion and I would so make that motion, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:40:24 - 1:40:44)
All righty. Questions for the Alderman? Applicant?

All right. Then Alderman Hopkins makes the motion to do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to his motion?

Okay. Hearing no objections, the item is passed.

[Speaker 22] (1:40:44 - 1:40:46)
All right. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:40:46 - 1:41:12)
Thank you, Bernie. Now we're at the bottom of page seven. Again, in the second ward, document number 20685 T1, common address, 2229 North Clybourne Avenue.

Change request, M12, Limited Manufacturing Business Park District, B22, Neighborhood Mixed Use District. We have Nick Batikas or Daniel Box.

[Speaker 14] (1:41:14 - 1:41:19)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman. Daniel Box instead of Nick, unfortunately for you guys.

[Speaker 1] (1:41:19 - 1:41:22)
All right. Let's talk about Clybourne.

[Speaker 14] (1:41:23 - 1:42:27)
Great. So once again, I'm Daniel Box, attorney with the Wallace & Sam Banks. I'm here today on behalf of the applicant, Convention Center Drive, LLC.

The applicant is the owner of the subject property located at 2229 North Clybourne Avenue. The property is improved with a three-story mixed use building. The applicant is seeking to bring the existing building into compliance under the current zoning code and thereby to permit the conversion of the existing grade level retail unit on-site into one additional dwelling unit for a total of three dwelling units at the subject property.

No changes are proposed to the existing building's height, footprint, or setbacks. On-site garage parking for two vehicles will continue to be provided at the rear of the lot. In order to permit the project, the applicant is seeking a zoning change from an M12, limited manufacturing business park district to a B22 neighborhood mixed use district.

We have worked with the local community and Alderman Hopkins on this project. I believe a letter of support should already be on file for this application. And with that, I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have.

[Speaker 1] (1:42:28 - 1:42:36)
All right. Alderman Hopkins, we do have a letter, but I still think you're on. You want to speak on this one?

[Speaker 9] (1:42:36 - 1:44:14)
Yeah, sure. Just briefly, I won't elaborate on what council already stated. This is a clear case of existing use coming into conformity.

However, it is worth noting that in this case, when the applicant presented to the community association of record with the request to convert ground floor commercial retail space along a sidewalk on a commercial street to residential, there was not only there was no objection, they understood and they supported it. That's a departure in recent years. That would be a non-starter for most neighborhood associations who aggressively protect their storefronts on their commercial strips that abut residential areas, just because obviously it serves a need, whether it's a dry cleaner or whatever it is.

But in this case, there was clear recognition that a commercial tenant was unlikely to be located. There was no clear need. We probably have a little bit more on that strip of Clybourne than we can realistically hope to find tenants for.

So to reactivate the space and someone would like to reside there, in this case, I support it and the neighborhood association of record did as well. They understand the need for it. So that's a change from what we've seen over the years and similar proposals.

And I just think it should be noted that there's a certain pragmatism that my neighbors bring to the table when they look at changes like this. And I respect them for their willingness to step up and express their opinions. And I'm in full support of this change.

[Speaker 10] (1:44:15 - 1:44:15)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:44:16 - 1:45:21)
Thank you, Alderman. Any questions for the Alderman or the applicant? Hearing no questions, Vice Chair Roboius moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the item is passed. Thanks, Brian.

Here today on behalf of the applicants, Mr. Cornell and Maria Curata, the applicants are the owner of the subject property located at 2636 West Adams Street. The property is currently vacant and unimproved. The applicant is here today seeking a zoning change to permit a new three-story, three-dwelling unit residential building at the subject property.

The proposed building will measure 36 feet, five inches in height, and onsite garage parking for three cars will be provided at the rear of the lot. Mr. Chair, I just want to make sure that it's clear. We had initially brought this application proposing a three-story, four-unit building.

We have since amended those plans with the substitute narrative and plans, and it's those plans that are at issue today. So, I want to make sure that that's made known, that this is a three-unit building that we're requesting.

[Speaker 1] (1:50:02 - 1:50:18)
Okay, instead of the four, you're down to three. That's right. Alderman Ravois moves to accept the substantive narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? All right, no objections, so the narrative and plans are accepted.

[Speaker 14] (1:50:19 - 1:50:45)
Thank you. In order to permit the project, the applicant is seeking a zoning change from an M-1-2 limited manufacturing business park district to a B-2-3 neighborhood mixed-use district. We have worked with the local community and Alderman Burnett on this project.

I believe that the Alderman is here at this meeting today to speak on the matter. I don't want to put any words in his mouth, but I believe he's in support of the proposal, so I'll turn it over to him, and of course, I'll be happy to answer any questions you might have.

[Speaker 1] (1:50:45 - 1:50:48)
Alderman Burnett on this West Adams application.

[Speaker 3] (1:50:49 - 1:51:11)
Yes, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. We've had a meeting with the local community group, which is the homeowners of Westown, in reference to this, and we had a community meeting on Zoom. No one has a challenge with this.

We support this. We ask for the committee's support. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:51:12 - 1:51:35)
Any questions for the applicant or the Alderman? Hearing none, that's Alderman Roboyes moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that?

Hearing none, this item is passed with the substantive narrative and plans.

[Speaker 14] (1:51:36 - 1:51:37)
All right. Thank you, Mr. Chair.

[Speaker 1] (1:51:38 - 1:51:46)
Thank you. I'm going to give you one second.

[Speaker 37] (1:51:56 - 1:53:11)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (1:53:11 - 1:53:36)
Top of page nine, document number 20665-T1, 3rd Ward. Ordinance was referred on April 21st of 21. Common address is 318 through 328 East 43rd Street.

And the change request, RM5, residential multi-unit district, to be 32 community shopping district. Alvin Charity. Alvin.

[Speaker 18] (1:53:42 - 1:53:43)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (1:53:45 - 1:53:48)
Yes, we can, Alvin. Nice to see you. It's been a long time.

[Speaker 18] (1:53:48 - 1:53:49)
It has been a long time.

[Speaker 1] (1:53:49 - 1:53:54)
All right. Can we proceed on the 43rd Street application, please?

[Speaker 18] (1:53:54 - 1:57:42)
Certainly. Again, for the record, my name is Alvin Charity at Charity and Associates PC. We represent the applicant on this matter.

The amendment is necessary to allow the rehabilitation of the existing buildings on the site for retail, restaurant, entertainment, and banquet hall uses. We have submitted three exhibits to assist in our presentation, an aerial photo of the subject property and the surrounding area, a street view of the subject property in its current state, and a rendering of the subject property. If we could go to the aerial, please?

All right. Why don't we just, I'm sorry, we must, we don't have the aerial, but let's just go, let's just leave it right here. The Forum property, which is before you, is located on the northwest corner of East 43rd Street and South Calumet Avenue, directly across from the CTA Green Line Station and is a transit-served development.

The Forum was built in 1897. During the Great Migration, the Forum served as a hub for cultural entertainment and community meeting space. In its heyday, the Forum hosted acts such as Nat King Cole, Muddy Waters, and many other jazz and blues greats.

The historic significance of the Forum was recognized in 2019 when it was listed on the National Register as a historic landmark. The Forum is made up of three buildings, the main building being the Forum Hall. There is the West Annex to the west of the Forum Hall building, which is primarily commercial space and retail space, and in the rear of the Forum Hall building is the North Annex.

The West Annex contains ground floor retail spaces, which we redeveloped to house creative enterprises complementing the Forum Hall, including a creative incubator, a boutique theater, and an art gallery. The Forum Hall will be rehabilitated to house restaurant, meeting, and entertainment uses. The North Annex will be redeveloped for smaller entertainment venues and banquet uses.

Can you show the, please move to the rendering of the building as completed, please. Next slide, please. It's a color rendering.

Right there, thank you. The Forum will be rehabilitated in three phases. Phase one is the rehabilitation of the West Annex retail spaces, which are expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2022.

Phase two is the rehabilitation of the Forum Hall retail restaurant space, which is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2023. Phase three is the rehabilitation of the Forum Hall assembly space in the North Annex, which is expected to be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of 2023. The total projected development costs are about $20 million.

The applicant has hosted several events to engage the community in the plans for the redevelopment of the Forum, including an evening at the Forum, 43rd Street cleanup, Forum Fridays, and a Forum Town Hall. Alderman Dow, who I believe is in attendance, has expressed her support for the proposed zoning amendment. We have also submitted to the committee copies of letters of support from community members and Landmark Chicago.

At this time, Mr. Chairman, I'll entertain any questions that the committee may have.

[Speaker 1] (1:57:46 - 1:57:53)
Thanks, Alvin. Amazing project. And how long has this been vacant?

[Speaker 18] (1:57:55 - 1:57:59)
This building has been vacant, Alderman, since the 70s.

[Speaker 1] (1:58:01 - 1:58:05)
And right by the train station. And parking, no parking?

[Speaker 18] (1:58:05 - 1:58:28)
There is no parking at this time. The applicant, to the east, west, and south of the building are vacant lots, some of which I believe are owned by the city. And so the applicant has expressed an interest in discussing with the city the possibility of acquiring one of those vacant lots for parking.

But there is currently no parking, Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (1:58:29 - 1:58:48)
All right. I know Alderman Dow would like to speak on this item. And I know she's been in and out of meetings.

Do we, Alderman Dow? Any questions from committee members, actually, or comments?

[Speaker 12] (1:58:49 - 1:58:53)
No questions. It's a great project. Move to pass by Alderman Davenport.

[Speaker 1] (1:58:54 - 1:59:34)
Okay. What I'm going to do is going to accept that motion. But I'm also going to, when Alderman Dow gets back in, I want her to comment on this since it's such an exciting revitalization of an important corner in her ward.

So Alderman Moore makes the motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to the motion? Okay.

Hearing no objections, the item is passed. And Alderman, I might have to ask you to come back for a second when we have Alderman Dow.

[Speaker 18] (1:59:34 - 1:59:37)
Certainly, Mr. Chairman, I will remain available.

[Speaker 1] (1:59:38 - 2:00:18)
Okay. Thank you so much. Middle of page nine, document number 20682T1 in the 11th ward.

The ordinance was referred on April 21st of 21. Common address is 3212 through 3228 South Shields Avenue and 3213 through 3229 South Stewart Avenue. And the change request M12 limited manufacturing business park district and RM4.5 residential multi-unit district all to an RM5 residential multi-unit district. Richard Toth. Richard.

[Speaker 33] (2:00:19 - 2:01:38)
Thank you. Good morning, Chairman Tony and members of the zoning committee. My name is Rich Toth.

I'm an attorney on behalf of the applicant, which is seeking a zoning change to RM5 to allow a new residential development. The subject property is currently the business location of the applicant's principal. He's been there for several years and has relocated within the city.

The proposal is for a 14 unit townhouse development. Each unit will be approximately 2000 square feet above grade. Each unit will have two parking spaces.

The site will fit in with the neighborhood and that there's a new townhouse development to both the North and to the South of the subject property. Our proposed development is similar to both of those because the change will be primarily from an M district to an R district. It is a type one application.

We did submit a substitute narrative and site plan to the department of planning and development. There were no changes to the building design. The only change, the need for which was pointed out by DPD was to clearly label an entry driveway, which had been marked as landscaping.

I'd ask if we could include that substitute narrative and site plan. So moved chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:01:39 - 2:01:48)
Okay. Is that Ray Lopez? Yes.

Alderman Lopez moves to accept the substitute narrative plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

[Speaker 33] (2:01:49 - 2:01:50)
Any objections?

[Speaker 1] (2:01:52 - 2:01:56)
Hearing none, the substitute narrative plans are in front of us. Thank you.

[Speaker 33] (2:01:56 - 2:02:31)
Thank you, chairman. Alderman Thompson had hosted a meeting to allow the applicant to present the project to the community. Neighbors were supportive of the project.

As a result, Alderman Thompson was kind enough to provide a letter of support for the project. I believe you have a copy of that. We do.

Thank you. Subject to the approval of the zoning change with the substitute, the project will comply with the ordinance. On behalf of the applicant, we request your favorable recommendation and can answer any questions you may have.

[Speaker 1] (2:02:32 - 2:03:04)
All right. It said we have a letter from Alderman Thompson in support. Any questions by committee members?

Hearing no objection, Alderman Dowell moves to pass on the item. Any opposed to her motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Speaking of Alderman Dowell, we're going to move back for her comments on the forum, I believe on 43rd Street. Alderman Pat Dowell.

[Speaker 5] (2:03:08 - 2:03:21)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for your consideration. Asking the committee members to support this zoning change of the forum, which is under rehabilitation.

[Speaker 1] (2:03:37 - 2:04:46)
Thank you, Alderwoman. Mr. Chair, he made a very compelling presentation. And Alderman David Moore made the motion to move to pass, which he reiterated.

And there were no objection from committee members. So congratulations. I know it's a catalyst for that whole area, though.

So we're very proud of that and hope to be patrons someday soon. Thanks, Alderwoman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. All righty. With that, we're going to be on the bottom of page nine. And we are at document number 20671T1, 25th Ward.

The ordinance was referred on April 21st on 21. The common address is 1721 West 21st Street. The change request RM5 residential multi-unit district to B23 neighborhood mixed-use district.

And before I ask Tyler Manick to get on, I just want confirmation from Anna on this. Our staff seems to think there's a disconnect with the document number. Is that correct?

[Speaker 38] (2:04:47 - 2:04:49)
Yeah, I just want to double check with you.

[Speaker 1] (2:04:50 - 2:05:00)
All right. Anna, on this application, we have a substantive narrative and plans. Is that the way you see it in the 25th Ward?

[Speaker 7] (2:05:05 - 2:05:06)
That should be correct, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:05:09 - 2:05:14)
All right. All right. Well, if it's not with Anna, you know she's going to speak up.

[Speaker 35] (2:05:16 - 2:05:21)
Chairman, this is Patrick. I'll go talk to Anna and we'll circle back. Okay.

I'll double check right now.

[Speaker 20] (2:05:24 - 2:05:29)
I'm sorry. I'm back. What was the question, Chairman?

This is Anna Robles. All right.

[Speaker 1] (2:05:29 - 2:05:47)
Let's rephrase the question. There was a question about the document number and that this one was with a change in the substantive narrative and plans on the T1. And that's 20671T1, 1721 West 21st Street.

[Speaker 5] (2:05:48 - 2:05:54)
I have 20667. Let's check. 20671.

[Speaker 1] (2:06:00 - 2:06:01)
Just a typo, you think?

[Speaker 30] (2:06:02 - 2:06:04)
I believe so, but let me confirm.

[Speaker 5] (2:06:08 - 2:06:13)
Yes, it is 20671T1. That's a typo.

[Speaker 1] (2:06:14 - 2:06:41)
I have that correct? It's an internal list. Okay.

All right. So let me read it again. Document number 20671T1, 25th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on April 21st of 21, 1721 West 21st Street. Change request RM5, residential multi-unit district to B23, neighborhood mixed-use district. Tyler Manick, please.

[Speaker 7] (2:06:41 - 2:07:17)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Shane Banks, Kenny and Schwartz. I'm here on behalf of Midway Assets, LLC, which owns the subject property at 1721 West 21st Street.

This application was filed as a type one zoning map amendment. As you mentioned, Mr. Chairman, there was a substitute project narrative and plans submitted. This was just a correct typos of some of the setbacks that were listed in the narrative and plans.

So I'd ask that we amend the application to include the substitute project narrative and plans.

[Speaker 1] (2:07:17 - 2:07:33)
All right. So Alderman Ravois moves to accept the substantive narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to his motion?

Hearing none, the substantive narrative and plans are in front of us. All right. Continue, Tyler.

[Speaker 7] (2:07:34 - 2:09:13)
Thank you. The owner intends to renovate the neglected property at 1721 West 21st Street. The property is currently zoned as RM5.

The applicant seeking a zoning map amendment to a B23 zoning district in order to develop the parcel with a seven unit residential building. The property is a transit serve location in close proximity to the Ashland bus corridor and 18th Street CTA pink line station. The applicant seeks to rezone this property in order to renovate the existing building with the amount of units allowed on its existing zoning, but to have the parking ratio allowed as a transit serve location, having three parking spaces, a parking ratio of 43% that is an allowable parking reduction for a B zone property within a transit serve location.

The applicant is also of the seven units. Two of the units will be provided at affordable rents. Prior to filing this application, the applicant engaged in the alderman's community process meeting with his zoning advisory board and adjacent neighbors who were supportive of the applicant's project to rehabilitate a neglected parcel and provide these affordable rents.

With the community's feedback, the alderman has provided this committee with a letter of support that I forwarded on to the committee. With the support of the alderman, I respectfully request this committee's favorable recommendation to rezone 1721 West 21st Street to a B23 zoning district as amended, and I'd be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (2:09:16 - 2:09:24)
Questions for the applicant? I know we have Citra Lopez on the call. Byron, do you want to comment on this item on 21st Street, please?

[Speaker 10] (2:09:25 - 2:09:52)
Yeah, thank you, chairman. No, I want to thank the applicant. I know that we went through a robust community-driven process where neighbors and the community advisory board are both in support, and we are glad to see also some affordable housing units as well as we having a property in the ward, so we are supportive of this item and ask my colleagues for a favorable vote on this item.

Thank you, chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:09:53 - 2:10:41)
Thank you, any questions for the alderman or the applicant? Hearing none, can I get a motion moved to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? So moved.

Alderman Haddon makes that motion. Any objections to her motion? Hearing no objections, the item is passed as revised, I believe, with the substantive narrative in place.

Thank you. All right, top of page 10, document number 20675, T1, 25th Ward. Ordinance was referred on April 21st of 21.

This address, 1827 South May Street, and the change request, RT4 residential two-flat townhouse to an RM6 residential multi-unit district. Tyler Manick.

[Speaker 7] (2:10:42 - 2:13:08)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Tyler Manick of Shane Banks Kenyon Schwartz. I'm here on behalf of the owner of the property at 1827 South May.

The property is currently improved with a three and a half story residential building containing eight apartments. The property is located in the newly created Pilsen multi-unit preservation district, which has stated purpose of preserving existing densities in order to prevent displacement. The applicant acquired this property in 2020.

In the course of refinancing the parcel, the applicant was required to obtain confirmation from the zoning administrator about the number of dwelling units established at the parcel. It was then determined that the property had eight dwelling units in 1960. However, two of the units were in a coach house that was later demolished at some uncertain date without the two units in the front building being re-established in the existing building.

Consequently, the applicant seeks to rezone this parcel from an RT4 to an RM6 zoning district in order to establish with building permits, these two non-conforming units as this property falls outside the newly created ADU pilot zone, which would otherwise allow this project to proceed as right. This will also allow the applicant to keep the existing tenants and maintain the affordable rents for the units, which are all under a thousand dollars for two bedroom units. Prior to filing this application, the applicant did engage with the aldermen's community process, which included meeting with the zoning advisory board.

The zoning advisory board, in addition to appreciating the affordable rents that are at this property, requested that the applicant convert one of the ground floor units to an accessible unit, which the applicant has also agreed to do. So one of the units that will be provided, this property will now be an ADA accessible unit. And because of that, the zoning advisory board support this project.

And the alderman was also kind enough to provide the applicant with a letter confirming support, which was submitted to this committee. With the support of the alderman, the applicant requests this committee's favorable recommendation for the rezoning and would be happy to answer, and I'd be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (2:13:11 - 2:13:15)
But I'll wait to hear from the alderman. Alderman Citro Lopez.

[Speaker 10] (2:13:16 - 2:13:58)
Thank you, chairman. And yes, we are in support of this project as well as Tyler mentioned, this has been a property that's been in the world or in the works since 2020. We have done our due diligence, making sure that we protect the density, but as well as ensuring affordability and accessibility.

So we're happy to have come to a good agreement that I think is a benefit to the residents and the community at large. So I like to ask my colleagues for a favorable vote again on this item. And I want to thank the applicant also for the patience and working with our community advisory board and the community at large.

[Speaker 1] (2:13:58 - 2:14:23)
Thank you, alderman. I have a question. I don't see any other hands up right now, but okay.

What's the parking? How many parking spaces over here? There's three parking spaces that were paved after that coach house was demolished.

Okay. So it seems to me a fairly large jump in zoning. Could you explain why we're going to a six?

[Speaker 7] (2:14:23 - 2:14:28)
Well, that's to get to the density that exists there now.

[Speaker 1] (2:14:28 - 2:14:29)
Is it size of the lot?

[Speaker 7] (2:14:30 - 2:14:30)
Correct.

[Speaker 1] (2:14:31 - 2:14:33)
So it's 25 by 125 or what?

[Speaker 7] (2:14:33 - 2:14:34)
24 by a hundred.

[Speaker 1] (2:14:35 - 2:14:36)
Okay. So it's a short lot.

[Speaker 7] (2:14:37 - 2:14:37)
Correct.

[Speaker 1] (2:14:39 - 2:14:51)
Now, alderman, my question to you is once they get this building established, are you going to ask them to maybe bring the zoning back down?

[Speaker 7] (2:14:51 - 2:14:56)
Mr. Chairman, we'd be happy to do that. I talked to my client in advance.

[Speaker 1] (2:14:58 - 2:15:11)
I think, yeah, I mean, it would, it looks, it sticks out like a sore thumb. I would think in the context of the blocks over there. Anyways, I'm not sure, but I just think that might be a recommendation, but you guys can talk offline about that.

[Speaker 10] (2:15:11 - 2:15:30)
Yeah. Thank you, chairman. I think that's a good recommendation.

We did talk about that possibility is also to be conforming with the density that currently has, we don't want to lose the density, but to your point, also chairman, we also need to make sure that we bring it back. So we'll definitely address that. And that is a good recommendation.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:15:31 - 2:16:26)
All right. Any questions? Other questions for the alderman?

Hearing none, then vice chair Roboius makes the motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

All right. Now we're in the middle of page 10. Okay.

Alderman, I'll call you on a second here. This is document number 20684-T1, 30th ward. Ordinance was referred on April 21st of 21.

Common address 4415 through 4425 West school street. And the change request, RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RM5 residential multi-unit district. Tyler, you're on this one again.

[Speaker 7] (2:16:27 - 2:17:26)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. Again, for the record, my name is Tyler Mannick of Shane Banks, Kenyon Schwartz. I'm here on behalf of the applicant, Dominic Pelk, who owns the subject property of 4415 to 25 West school.

The, this parcel is improved with an existing legal nonconforming six dwelling unit building. The applicant seeks a zoning map amendment from an RS3 to an RM5 zoning district in order to add two dwelling units in the vacant unused garden level. No changes are being proposed to the existing building other than the interior build out of the two units in this garden level, which is otherwise raw vacant basement space.

The applicant submitted a substitute type one narrative to correct an error in the FAR calculation, which I respectfully request to be able to amend the application to include the corrected FAR in the type one narrative.

[Speaker 1] (2:17:27 - 2:17:41)
So Alderman Cardona moves to accept the substantive narrative plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the substantive narrative plans are accepted.

[Speaker 7] (2:17:43 - 2:18:20)
Thank you. Prior to filing the zoning map amendment application, the applicant met with Alderman Ravoiris to discuss this project. And after reviewing the proposed plans and meeting with the applicant, Alderman Ravoiris was kind enough to give the applicant a letter of support, which was forwarded on to the committee.

I know that vice chair Ravoiris is also on the line as well to confirm that. As a result, I respectfully request this committee favorably recommend approval of this zoning map amendment application as amended to rezone this property to an RM5 zoning district. I'd be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (2:18:21 - 2:18:23)
Alderman Ravoiris.

[Speaker 40] (2:18:23 - 2:18:51)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I don't know if I would use that word kind enough, but I'm in full support of the addition of two dwelling units under an existing six unit building for a total of eight. There are no changes to the size and structure of the existing building as the attorney just stated, and there are no objections to the zoning change, Mr. Chairman. I move to support this matter.

[Speaker 1] (2:18:51 - 2:19:12)
All right, then Alderman Ravoiris will actually move this item by the last, the same roll call that was used to determine form and any objections to his motion. Hearing none, this item is going to be passed with the substantive narrative of the plans.

[Speaker 37] (2:19:13 - 2:19:13)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (2:19:14 - 2:19:39)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Bottom of page 10, document number 20678 T1 in the 27th ward. The ordinance was referred on April 21st of 21.

Common address is 952 West Lake Street and 209 North Morgan Street. And the change request C12 neighborhood commercial district, the DX3 downtown mixed use district. Michael Esker.

[Speaker 29] (2:19:44 - 2:20:06)
Are we on the, excuse me, Mr. Chairman, are we on the top of page 11, Mr. Chairman?

[Speaker 1] (2:20:09 - 2:20:13)
Yeah. Yeah, we're on Lake and Morgan. Oh, thank you.

Sorry.

[Speaker 29] (2:20:14 - 2:21:15)
I thought you said page 10. Okay. And I was looking at my agenda that was showing it on the top of 11.

Thank you, Michael Esker on behalf of the applicant, big table LLC. And this is a zoning change that brings an existing legal nonconforming building into conformance and also allows for the addition, the conversion of the office space on the second floor to nine residential units. It is a transit serve location right on the Morgan Lake CTA stop.

And it is an existing bar restaurant that is popular in the West loop, which will continue to an operation. And again, this is for an interior remodeling of the second and third floors. We've been through the community process that Alderman Burnett has directed us on.

We have letters of support from the West loop community organization, as well as the West central association. And I believe Alderman Burnett is here to speak on your behalf.

[Speaker 1] (2:21:17 - 2:21:21)
All right. Alderman Burnett, Lake and Morgan. Walter.

[Speaker 3] (2:21:24 - 2:21:56)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. As the counselor said, he went through all of the community organizations. We had a community meeting, everyone in support of it.

We look forward to the developer, allowing the contractors to a joint venture with a minority contractor and hire people from the community. I'm in full support of this, this proposal and I ask for the committee support.

[Speaker 1] (2:21:57 - 2:22:51)
Alderman, any questions for the applicant or the Alderman? Let's see. No more questions.

Alderman Cardona makes a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Top of page 11, 28th ward number 20636 T1. The ordinance was referred on February 24th of 21. Common address is 1319 through 1325 South Ashland Avenue and 1542 through 1554 West Hastings Avenue.

And the change request is a B11 neighborhood shopping district to B35 community shopping district. Michael Esger.

[Speaker 29] (2:22:51 - 2:23:33)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Again, Michael Esger on behalf of the applicant. And with me today is Jim Castleberry, who's chief investment officer for Forest Bay, who is the developer behind the applicant.

And we are seeking this zoning change to allow for the redevelopment of this lot to commercial uses. This is space that is affordable in nature and will serve the community. And I think Jim is here to explain a little bit about the use.

I'm not sure if he's been elevated to speaker status.

[Speaker 1] (2:23:34 - 2:23:35)
You can speak.

[Speaker 34] (2:23:36 - 2:25:23)
Yes. Thank you, Chairman. I appreciate the opportunity to be able to speak to you today.

I'm the CEO of Forest Bay Partners. We are based here in- Jim, would you state your name for the record, please? Oh, my name is James Castleberry.

I go by Jim and I am the chief investment officer for Forest Bay Partners, which is the applicant, I believe. We have a mission within the city of Chicago and the surrounding areas to really be able to narrow the gaps between racial, social and economic inequalities. We have projects that are in the area that we did.

We did Chicago Center for Arts and Technology that's just around the corner on Palina and 13th. On 79th and Champlain, we did building for Chicago Cook Workforce Partnership. And for this project that we have on South Ashland, our intended use is to be a community resource for the nonprofits there in the area.

We're working with the Resurrection Project, which is right down the street. But the whole purpose of the work that we do is really to provide opportunity for the community, and we do have the support of Alderman Irvin. And we look forward to continue to do this work within the city of Chicago.

[Speaker 29] (2:25:24 - 2:25:34)
Thank you, Jim. Mr. Chairman, we have worked with Alderman Irvin's process and he is here to speak as needed. And we're here and available to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (2:25:36 - 2:25:42)
Was just to reiterate, Michael, did we have a substantive narrative?

[Speaker 29] (2:25:42 - 2:25:50)
Oh, thank you. Yes, Mr. Chairman. I would like to respectfully request that the substitute narrative and plans that were updated be introduced.

[Speaker 1] (2:25:52 - 2:26:10)
All right, so Alderman Hopkins moved to accept the substantive narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that? Okay, so no objections.

So the substantive narrative plans are accepted. All right. All right, Michael, anything else?

[Speaker 29] (2:26:11 - 2:26:13)
No, we're available for any questions.

[Speaker 1] (2:26:13 - 2:26:19)
All right. Well, we do have Alderman Irvin on the line. Jason, would you like to speak on this issue on South Ashland?

[Speaker 23] (2:26:20 - 2:27:44)
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. The work that 4S Bay is doing there for the community, this is actually a fairly isolated area of the ward, not a lot of residential or any other areas as part right on the edge of the Obla CHA Roosevelt Square redevelopment area.

There were some concerns about the height of the building that were raised by the Department of Planning. I know some slight adjustments have been made. However, with the Ashland frontage that exists and as well as the master plan for Roosevelt Square, it's going to call for some additional height along Ashland.

Did not feel in the long term over the course of the plan development being implemented that this would have such a huge impact as planning has stated so far. If you look at the Roosevelt Square plan, they are calling for higher height buildings along Ashland. It also sits there along with the 17th SOI CHA senior structure.

It's about a block and a half away from the subject property. So, all things considered and the use that's being proposed by 4S Bay, I think it's in the best interest of the Westside to move forward with the designated development that's being put forth in the type one application.

[Speaker 1] (2:27:45 - 2:27:59)
Thank you, Alderman. Any questions for the Alderman or the applicant? Hearing no questions, can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 4] (2:27:59 - 2:28:01)
So moved, Alderwoman Hadden.

[Speaker 1] (2:28:01 - 2:28:17)
Alderwoman Hadden makes that motion. Any objections to the motion? Hearing no objections, this item is passed with the substantive narrative and plans.

Thank you and good luck to everybody on this exciting project.

[Speaker 23] (2:28:18 - 2:28:20)
Do I have anything else up, Mr. Chairman?

[Speaker 1] (2:28:24 - 2:28:57)
I think you're good, Jason, but let me just do... Okay. Yeah, we do.

Let's see. We have one on South Washtenaw for you, sir. Let me just see on the deferred and you have something on the deferred item.

Is it deferred again on Troy? Okay. All right.

So that looks like one. Are you asking to try to get this done now?

[Speaker 23] (2:28:57 - 2:29:01)
If I could, I'd like to go back and have some challenges.

[Speaker 1] (2:29:01 - 2:29:04)
We'll give you a medical excuse today.

[Speaker 23] (2:29:04 - 2:29:04)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:29:05 - 2:29:38)
Your voice isn't there completely. So we'll move to the top of page 16, staying in the 28th Ward, document number 20196. Ordinance was deferred on September 18th of 19 and the change request, M11, Limited Manufacturing Business Park District and C31, Commercial Manufacturing Employment District, all to C31, Commercial Manufacturing Employment District, and then to an Institutional Plan Development.

And we have Graham Grady on the call on this one.

[Speaker 19] (2:29:39 - 2:30:42)
Hello, Chairman Tunney, can you hear me? I can. Good afternoon, Chairman Tunney and members of the committee.

My name is Graham Grady and along with my colleague Sylvia Mikus, we're pleased to represent the applicants, Chicago Hope Academy and the Chicago Lions Charitable Association for this application. First of all, Mr. Chairman, the application has been amended even prior to it appearing on the agenda of the Chicago Plan Commission. The ultimate zoning district for this is actually a C3-3, not a C3-1.

Just to explain the change, when we first filed this application long ago, the ultimate zoning prior to it being a plan development was going to be a C3-1. However, in the process of the application and working with the Department of Planning and Development, the actual change is to change the current M11 and C31 to a C3-3. Also, Mr. Chairman, we would request that the record of the Chicago Plan Commission be incorporated into the record of the Committee on Zoning today.

[Speaker 1] (2:30:44 - 2:31:08)
Hold on, Graham. All right, staff just told me that that substitute was made a plan commission, correct?

[Speaker 19] (2:31:09 - 2:31:10)
Yes. Yes, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:31:11 - 2:31:14)
And then when we incorporate the records, we'll have rectified that situation?

[Speaker 19] (2:31:15 - 2:31:15)
Correct.

[Speaker 1] (2:31:16 - 2:31:16)
Okay.

[Speaker 19] (2:31:17 - 2:32:28)
Thank you. Again, also, first of all, I'd very much like to thank Alderman Urban for his direction and guidance through the community review process. We held not one but two community meetings on this project.

We are unaware of any opposition to the project. In addition, two members of the community had planned to speak this morning during the public commentary section, but they were unable to do so. We also have several members of our team available for questions in the event such as needed, including Bob Mazuchowski, who is the founder and CEO of Chicago Opal Academy, Jeff Simon, who is the head of the Chicago Lions Charitable Association.

We have our project architect, Joe Buehler, and Louay Abuna, who is our traffic consultant. As you can see from these renderings, this is going to be a fantastic new facility in the East Garfield Park of Chicago. Chicago Opal Academy and Chicago Lions have come together to establish this educational and recreational campus along Harrison Street in Washtenaw.

[Speaker 1] (2:32:29 - 2:32:38)
Graham? Yes. Staff also tells me you have multiple, multiple slides, so in the interest of time, we want to make sure that you use the CliffsNote version, okay?

[Speaker 19] (2:32:39 - 2:32:43)
Yes. I was actually almost done to be respectful of time. Oh, good.

[Speaker 1] (2:32:44 - 2:32:44)
All right.

[Speaker 19] (2:32:44 - 2:33:49)
That's good. It's going to be a fantastic project. It includes a three-story high school.

It includes a phenomenal number of NCAA-rated and qualified athletic facilities. The program also includes activities for youth in the neighborhood and some volunteer programs that are sponsored by both the Chicago Lions as well as Chicago Opal Academy. With that, I will defer to any questions that you may have, but as you can see from these slides, this is a first-class, high-quality project.

Also, 90% of the students at the high school receive some sort of financial aid, but this is a school that is open for application for anyone. Almost 100% of the students go on to college, and the rugby program and the other athletic programs here are in great service to the community. Mr. Chair, with that, I'll stop. Our team is available to answer questions. We greatly appreciate your consideration of this application.

[Speaker 1] (2:33:51 - 2:34:06)
Well, Graham, it's just an exciting project here, but I know Walter Burnett has his hand up and I'm going to ask. Walter, would you want to speak before Alderman Irvin, or are you going to wait until he speaks?

[Speaker 3] (2:34:09 - 2:36:03)
I'll acquiesce to Alderman Irvin, whatever he wants to do. Go ahead, Walter. Go ahead, Alderman.

I may learn something. Okay. Walter, why don't you speak on it?

Was that Alderman Irvin or Danny Davis? First of all, I want to congratulate Alderman Irvin. He's so blessed to have this facility in his ward, and I also want to thank him for allowing it to be in my ward in the remap.

Thank you very much, Alderman Irvin. This is a great organization. Bob Muszkowski has done a lot.

He started his program over in Cabrini Green years ago with Jesse White, actually, and it has just grown. They say a good tree bears good fruit, and this tree has bared many, many good fruits. He's developed a school, the grammar school, now the high school.

This athletic facility is just such a blessing to our community. He actually helps a lot of young people with disadvantaged communities and their families, and I'm just so happy to be able to vote on this. This is such a blessing for that neighborhood, and I have no doubt that many people from the community are going to benefit from this facility with the jobs, with contracts, with everything, because that's just how Bob is.

I just want to say, congratulations. God bless you. Congratulations to both the Alderman and to the organization.

[Speaker 19] (2:36:04 - 2:36:05)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:36:05 - 2:36:12)
All right. Before we hear from Alderman Irvin, Graham, do we incorporate the records from the Planning Commission?

[Speaker 19] (2:36:13 - 2:36:18)
Yes, please. That is our request. I believe you already did that, but if we take a vote on that, that would make it official.

[Speaker 1] (2:36:18 - 2:36:41)
Okay. My staff says we haven't done that, so I'm going to move to incorporate the records of the Planning Commission by the same roll call that was used to determine form. Alderman Roboius makes that motion, and any objections?

So moved. Hearing none, the records are incorporated, so are we ready for Alderman Irvin now? Jason?

[Speaker 23] (2:36:42 - 2:38:13)
Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, members of the committee.

Alderman Burnett, you can have the old facility right off Ogden, come across the street, pick that up from the home. We'll let you have that. We're going to hold on to the new facility, and I want to say- Don't be playing that, Jason.

I know. It'd be good. But what I will say is that this process started some almost four years ago when we were talking about the redevelopment of King Elementary School.

While the community saw a different need at that particular site, I think that in the end, what we have today is much greater and better than what we could have ever imagined at the King site. So the work that Bob and the Chicago Hopers, Chicago Lions, and everyone has done to bring this to this point has been a yeoman's task. They have gotten this thing done, gotten great support and conversations in the community, and again, moving from near west over to East Garfield Park.

I thought it was very important for the residents in East Garfield to truly understand the work that Bob, Chicago Hopes, Chicago Lions were doing at that old dilapidated Superfund site. So glad to see what he's done thus far with the NCAA track, the attack athletic facility becoming more community open and friendly, and the work they're going to do with Chicago Hope Academy bringing that over as well. So look forward for a favorable recommendation from the committee.

We appreciate it.

[Speaker 1] (2:38:13 - 2:38:22)
Thank you, Alderman. Any more questions, comments? Mr. Chairman, I'd like to make a comment. All right, that's Vice Chair Roboyes.

[Speaker 40] (2:38:23 - 2:38:34)
Alderman Irvin, great project. Congratulations on that. But I also want to congratulate Alderman Burnett, who's going to be the recipient, I guess, when the lines are drawn.

[Speaker 23] (2:38:34 - 2:38:41)
So he'll get the old school, which is over on Ogden somewhere. We're going to keep this on our agenda.

[Speaker 40] (2:38:41 - 2:38:43)
All right. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 19] (2:38:43 - 2:38:51)
All right. Mr. Chairman, Alderman Irvin has also provided a letter of support, which we provided to your staff. We appreciate that being in the record as well.

[Speaker 1] (2:38:51 - 2:39:11)
We'll have it done. All right. Thanks, everybody.

So I'm going to, Vice Chair Roboyes, moves do pass on this motion by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, this item is passed.

[Speaker 19] (2:39:11 - 2:39:12)
Thank you, Chairman Tunney.

[Speaker 1] (2:39:12 - 2:39:49)
Okay. All right. Now we're going to go back.

All right. Middle of page 11, document number 20683 T1 in the 30th ward. Ordinance was referred on April 21st of 21.

Common address is 4730 West Street. Change request. RS3, residential single unit detached house district to an RT3.5 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district. Dan Lauer.

[Speaker 39] (2:39:51 - 2:40:27)
Afternoon, Mr. Chairman and Mr. Vice Chairman. This is 20683 T1 4730 West Grace. It's a larger lot and I represent a pretty busy builder over there.

G7 investment series M. So in 2019, before COVID, with all the men of Roboyes' assistance, we started this as RM4.5, but the neighborhood didn't want to increase height. We tried again with the Vice Chairman's assistance and we respect the fact that he listened to all his constituents.

[Speaker 40] (2:40:28 - 2:40:29)
It's not over yet.

[Speaker 39] (2:40:29 - 2:40:48)
Cannot support the added height. So we're proceeding only as RS3 to RF3.5, just to legalize the third unit, which is not regarded as a legal unit with the building department. And we'd like to thank the Vice Chairman and his staff for their support.

[Speaker 40] (2:40:48 - 2:40:52)
No, Mr. Chairman, I got to speak on this.

[Speaker 1] (2:40:52 - 2:40:59)
All right. All right. So Alderman Roboyes on the West Grace Street application.

[Speaker 40] (2:41:00 - 2:41:09)
I have to respectfully apologize to Mr. Lauer, because the community is asking for a community meeting on this matter. So I got to defer this matter.

[Speaker 1] (2:41:11 - 2:41:19)
All right. So do I hear a motion to defer this item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 39] (2:41:21 - 2:41:22)
So moved by Alderman Cardona.

[Speaker 1] (2:41:23 - 2:41:37)
Alderman Cardona makes that motion. Any objections other than Mr. Lauer? Not too funny.

I'm sorry. Hearing none, the item is deferred. So we'll get to see you hopefully quickly.

All right, Daniel.

[Speaker 37] (2:41:38 - 2:41:39)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (2:41:40 - 2:42:07)
So now we're on the bottom of page 11, document number 20670, 43rd Ward. Ordinance was referred on April 21st of 21. The common address is 1952 North Bissell Street.

And the change request, RT4, residential two-flat townhouse to an RM5, residential multi-unit district. Let's see. Tom Pekarski is on the call.

[Speaker 31] (2:42:07 - 2:42:49)
All right. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. I am Tom Pekarski of the Law Firm of Gordon and Pekarski representing the applicant, Carolina Lapikas on this matter.

But before you seeking an amendment of the city of Chicago zoning map from the current RT4 to that of an RM5 for the property commonly known as 1952 North Bissell Street. Subject property is a substandard lot measuring 24 by 60 feet. In its history, it was originally a full-size city lot and improved with a two-unit building almost 130 years ago.

Subsequent to the...

[Speaker 40] (2:42:49 - 2:42:50)
We had it on the agenda.

[Speaker 31] (2:42:51 - 2:44:13)
Subsequent to improvement of the property, the city took more than half of the length of the property through eminent domain for CTA purposes decades ago. The applicants seek not... Resulting in a lot that is that substandard and causing us to seek a zoning amendment to improve the property.

The applicants seeks to renovate and expand the floor area of the existing building by constructing a front and third floor addition to the property. The zoning amendment is sought in order to allow for additional proposed floor area. We have reviewed our plans with Alderman Smith, who has previously forwarded a letter of support to the chair.

We have also met with the Ranch Triangle Association on several occasions and they similarly have expressed their support for the proposal. Therefore, we ask the committee to vote its recommendation of passage of the application to the full city council.

[Speaker 1] (2:44:14 - 2:44:47)
All right. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Smith and we have any questions from committee members? Comments?

All right. Hearing none, Alderman Cardona makes a motion due pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to his motion?

Hearing none, the item is passed. Thank you. All right.

I know the block pretty well. I'm interested. I didn't realize there were 60 foot lots in the depth.

[Speaker 31] (2:44:48 - 2:44:57)
The entire block is dense and now non-conforming because of the CTA years ago.

[Speaker 1] (2:44:58 - 2:44:59)
All right. Thank you, Tom.

[Speaker 31] (2:44:59 - 2:45:00)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (2:45:00 - 2:45:34)
All right. Now on the top page 12, document number 20673 in the 42nd ward. The ordinance was referred on April 21st of 21.

Common address 210 South Canal Street, 307 through 309 South Clinton Street and 310 South Canal Street. And change request plan development number 376 to a new plan development change number 376. Lenny Asaro.

[Speaker 42] (2:45:37 - 2:45:56)
Good afternoon, Chairman Tunney. Lenny Asaro. I'm a partner at Fagery, Drinker, Biddle, and Reed, one of the attorneys for the applicant.

Chairman Tunney, if you wouldn't mind, my associate Kevin Major, who's worked with me closely on this project, is it okay if he presents in my stead?

[Speaker 24] (2:45:57 - 2:49:01)
No problem. Kevin. Thank you, Lenny, and thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Kevin Major and I'm an attorney with Fagery, Drinker, Biddle, and Reed. I'm here on behalf of Amtrak regarding its proposed amendment to plan development 376, specifically PD statement 16 of that amendment. For context, plan development 376 consists of three sub areas.

Sub area A is the union station head house. Sub area B is the CTA transit center. And sub area C is an office building currently under construction.

And there have been two recent amendments to plan development 376, one in October of 2018 and one in May of 2020. So the proposed amendment we're here for today was filed April 21st. And as part of the amendment process, we not only engaged with DPD, but also Alderman Riley and his staff regarding the scope of the proposed amendment and any potential community meetings.

No meetings were called for and we received no objections from the Alderman's office. So as I mentioned, the proposed amendment merely seeks to amend PD statement 16. And the purpose of amending that statement is to allow for the transfer of FAR via future minor change.

And this amendment, if adopted, will align PD statement 16 with the second amended right of first offer that was entered into between Amtrak and the city earlier this year. So specifically the statement would be to call for 417,344 square feet of floor area ratio being transferred from sub area B, which is that CTA transit center to sub area A, which is the union station head house. And then also 7,868 square feet of floor area ratio being transferred from sub area C, which that office building under construction sub area A, which again is the union station head house.

So the total square footage at issue exists in the air above the existing CTA transit center site, which is that sub area B and the office building under construction, again, sub area C. The amendment does not seek to change the maximum building height of the head house site, which the city approved in 2018 as part of the previous amendment to PD 376. So if the amendment were adopted, Amtrak would request a minor change to transfer the FAR.

And then at that point, they would provide the city with documentation showing that Amtrak has expended at least 14.1 million on improvements to the Amtrak property. The city would then provide Amtrak with documentation showing infrastructure expenses the city has incurred at which point in time Amtrak would then reimburse the city for an amount not to exceed $500,000 for those expenses. So again, a technical amendment that nearly seeks to revise some of the language in PD statement 16.

But if there are any specific questions, I'd be happy to answer them.

[Speaker 1] (2:49:04 - 2:49:14)
All right. Thank you, Kevin. Questions by committee members?

We have Alderman Riley on the call.

[Speaker 8] (2:49:21 - 2:49:22)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (2:49:22 - 2:49:29)
A couple of things. Lenny, do you have a letter of support from Alderman Riley?

[Speaker 42] (2:49:32 - 2:49:55)
Chairman Toney, we have not received an actual letter from him. As Kevin indicated, we had multiple engagements with his office and his staff, and he did not express any objection. And he had previously approved the prior two amendments.

That's a direct answer to your question. Okay. I don't know if you've heard one.

[Speaker 1] (2:49:56 - 2:50:02)
Okay, let me do a two-step here. First of all, we need to incorporate the records of the Planning Commission.

[Speaker 42] (2:50:04 - 2:50:14)
I'd request that the chairman recommend a motion to incorporate the testimony as well as the records from the Planning Commission meeting that occurred last week. All right.

[Speaker 1] (2:50:14 - 2:50:34)
So Alderman Cardona moves to incorporate the records from the Planning Commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that? Hearing none, the records are incorporated, which did include Alderman Riley's positive recommendation of Planning Commission.

Is that correct?

[Speaker 42] (2:50:36 - 2:50:38)
That's my understanding, Chairman Toney. Okay.

[Speaker 36] (2:50:38 - 2:50:43)
Chairman Toney, it's Noah. We had a verbal from Joanna of his staff. We did not have a letter submitted.

[Speaker 1] (2:50:44 - 2:52:21)
Okay. Let me hold on one second. All right.

I just spoke to Alderman Riley and he is definitely supportive of this application. All right. So we got the records incorporated and we got the Alderman's support.

Do we have questions from committee members? Hearing no questions, Alderwoman Maria Haddon makes a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to her motion?

Hearing none, the item is passed as revised. All right.

[Speaker 37] (2:52:22 - 2:52:22)
Thank you, Chairman Toney.

[Speaker 1] (2:52:23 - 2:52:52)
All right. Thank you. All right.

Now we're in the middle of page 12, document number 20676T1, 49th Ward, referred on April 21st of 21. The common address is 1415 West Morse Avenue. And the change request, B32 Community Shopping District to B23 Neighborhood Mixed Use District.

Rolando Acosta.

[Speaker 21] (2:52:53 - 2:54:26)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. Pleasure to be here on behalf of the applicant on this matter. This property is approximately 150 feet from the Morse Avenue train station.

It's currently improved with a four-story building containing 14 dwelling units and ground floor commercial space. It's an unusually deep lot with 170 feet of depth and the building sits on approximately the front 70 feet of the lot. The proposal is to build an addition to the building to the rear of the existing building.

It would be a five-story addition. It would contain 16 dwelling units, including two affordable units, and would have nine parking spaces in an enclosed garage. We have had multiple meetings in the community, two community meetings, broad based, sponsored by the Alderwoman, and a couple of more private meetings or smaller meetings with neighbors have made some changes to address all of the concerns that have been raised.

The building, really the addition won't be seen from the street given the presence of the existing four-story building and the commercial will be retained along Morse Avenue. So the frontage for a passerby on the sidewalk will look exactly the same with some slight refurbishment upgrading to the existing facade of the building. With that, Mr. Chairman, I am happy to answer any questions and I know that the Alderwoman is here to speak on behalf of the community.

[Speaker 1] (2:54:28 - 2:54:31)
Alderwoman Hatton on this Morse Avenue application.

[Speaker 4] (2:54:32 - 2:55:55)
Thank you, Chairman, and thanks, Rolanda. So I can say this has been a pleasure working with the advocate, Mark, on this project. This is the type of smart development that I'm hoping we can see more of in the 49th ward and around the city.

As many of you know, we're a very dense community. We don't have a lot of space for large development. So looking and working with existing structures, this is beautiful, right?

We're using some sustainable practices. All the residents who currently live in the existing structure will get to stay. And while only two of those units are going to be deemed affordable via the ARO, the actual rental prices on the new structures are going to be well within our affordable housing guidelines for our area.

Adding accessibility with the new structure, bringing an elevator is also something we're very excited about. And the applicant has been a fantastic new neighbor in the community, as Rolanda mentioned, in addition to our two large community meetings, directly meeting with the neighbors and working through some of those tricky issues you have when you've got buildings that have been around for more than a hundred years and don't necessarily all conform to our current zoning. So I've got wholehearted community support for this as well as my own.

And I thank you guys for your time and appreciate your favorable support.

[Speaker 21] (2:55:56 - 2:56:04)
Mr. Tunney, Chairman Tunney, I have one item, which is we have a substitute narrative and plans that needs to be moved. Right.

[Speaker 1] (2:56:04 - 2:57:21)
All right. So Alderman Hadden moves to accept the substantive narrative plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to our motion?

All right. So hearing none, the substantive narrative plans are accepted. Obviously the testimony has been given.

Anything else, Rolanda, before we ask for... Nothing else unless there are questions, Mr. Chairman. All right.

Questions for this application on Morse? So moved by Alderman Cardona. Okay.

So no questions, no further questions. Alderman Cardona moves to pass the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objection?

No objections. So this item is passed with the substantive narrative and plans. Thank you very much.

We're at the bottom of page 12, document number 20242 T1 in the second ward. The ordinance was referred on November 13th of 19. Common address is 2227 North Clyburn.

The change request M12 limited manufacturing business park district to B23 neighborhood mixed use district.

[Speaker 21] (2:57:24 - 2:58:06)
Rolando Acosta. Good afternoon again, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant.

This involves an existing residential property on Clyburn that is zone manufacturing. I'd like to start by just clarifying for Alderman Hopkins, because when initially this was filed, it was to allow for a vacation rental and shared housing. There were some concerns about that raised by the neighborhood and as well as the alderman.

As a result, we have amended our application to actually prohibit shared housing and vacation rentals. There is a substitute narrative that so states, and we want to make sure that that is incorporated in the records along with the substitute plans.

[Speaker 1] (2:58:09 - 2:58:18)
All right. So Alderman Ravoyas moves to accept the substantive narrative plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

[Speaker 40] (2:58:18 - 2:58:19)
I'll move.

[Speaker 1] (2:58:19 - 2:58:44)
Any objections? All right. The substantive narrative plans are accepted.

And as far as the vacation rental shared housing aspect in the narrative purpose, we are going to make that codified that it will not include vacation rental or shared housing in this application.

[Speaker 21] (2:58:44 - 2:59:10)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. That leads the purpose of this amendment really to bring into conformity the existing, there's four residential units on the property, a three unit residential building along the Clyburn frontage and a single unit in the rear and the coach house. They've existed historically.

They have no parking and literally zone manufacturing. So we're trying to bring the use and the zoning into conformance with one another.

[Speaker 1] (2:59:10 - 2:59:13)
Okay. Alderman Hopkins.

[Speaker 9] (2:59:15 - 2:59:51)
Yeah. Thank you, Chairman Toney. Based on the substitute narrative, I will withdraw the letter of objection that I have on file and I will support this zoning change.

I would also just request that for the committee report when staff prepares that, just be cognizant of that one line description on the agenda that explicitly states this is to permit a short-term rental. If that line could just be deleted and the subsequent committee report just for the record, in which case I would have no further objection and I'll support the zoning change. Thank you.

[Speaker 30] (2:59:51 - 2:59:56)
All right. Staff. I can confirm that will be changed to Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:59:57 - 3:00:05)
So we'll have it ready for tomorrow's meeting with the narrative excluding vacation rental and shared housing.

[Speaker 9] (3:00:05 - 3:00:07)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Move do pass.

[Speaker 1] (3:00:08 - 3:00:33)
All right. So Alderman Hopkins moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, the item is passed with the substantive narrative and plans and the asterisk we just talked about. Thank you. All right.

Thank you. All right. Now we're on the top page, middle of, let me see where we are.

[Speaker 4] (3:00:36 - 3:00:41)
Okay. So, okay.

[Speaker 1] (3:00:41 - 3:01:22)
So I'm going to read into the record, but I'm going to ask for a motion to defer item number 2 0 6 6 0 T 1 32nd ward. The street and 28 15 through 28 25 North Paulina. These are adjacent properties.

It seems. And we just in the beginning, just deferred the one at 16 28 through 58 West Wolfram and Alderman Wagus back Scott.

[Speaker 39] (3:01:22 - 3:01:34)
Yes, chairman. I should have caught that at the beginning that we would do the two of them together, but it would be tied to that 2 0 6 5 9 T 1. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (3:01:34 - 3:01:37)
So I'm going to, are you going to make that motion to defer?

[Speaker 19] (3:01:39 - 3:01:43)
If you would like me to, I'll make a motion to defer if that's okay, even though it's mine.

[Speaker 1] (3:01:43 - 3:02:41)
Okay. Well then I'll have Alderman Cardona. We'll make that motion to be defer this item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections to that motion to defer? All right. No objections.

So that item is deferred also. Okay. So now we're on the bottom of page 13, document number 2 0 0 1 4 in the 12th ward ordinance was referred on April 10th of 19 common addresses, 21 39 and 21 59 West Pershing road.

The change request M two, three light industry district to B two, three neighborhood mixed use district and all to a B two, three neighborhood mixed use district to a plan development. And we have Steve Friedland here on this item in the 12th ward.

[Speaker 2] (3:02:42 - 3:04:39)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman. Can you hear me? Okay.

Thank you. My name is Steve Friedland, an attorney with the law firm of Applegate and Thompson here on behalf of the applicant for a plan development at 21 39 to 21 59 West Pershing road. We also have on the call a number of members of our team.

This is a project that is with code, our E partners and Hispanic housing development corporation together developing this from Hispanic housing. Paul Roldan is on the call today. We also have a project consultant, Tom Brantley and our project architect, Rick Whitney from Fitzgerald associates, and they're all available to answer any questions.

You can go to the next slide, please. And the next slide after that. Thanks.

So the, as you stated, this is a request to rezone two existing buildings along Pershing road from manufacturing to be two dash three to allow for a plan development. We're going to be doing a residential building in one of the buildings, the Western building, 120 units of affordable housing will go into that as an adaptive reuse. And we're also going to adaptively reuse the building on the East side, which is a 21 39 West Pershing as a mostly commercial office building with potentially some residential units up at the top.

Before I move on, maybe I'll take care of this procedural matter. We did appear before the plant commission on May 20th, and I would request that the committee would incorporate the findings and the recommendations of the plant commission to the record. All right.

[Speaker 1] (3:04:39 - 3:04:55)
So Alderman, Vice Chair Roboius moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to the plan commission recommendation? Hearing none, the records are incorporated.

Continue, Steve.

[Speaker 2] (3:04:55 - 3:16:39)
Thank you. So the slide you're looking at shows a community snapshot area. This project is located in the McKinley park community area.

It's technically a new city, but it's really more associated with McKinley park. You can see here some of the demographics of McKinley park. Let's go to the next slide.

Here's the zoning slide. You can see where our subject property is. It's located on the South side of Pershing road, and it's currently in an M2-3 district.

Let's go to the next slide. I think it's a good slide to explain the project and sort of why my client decided to develop it here, and I think it'll become also somewhat relevant in my later discussion that we had a long discussion at the plant commission about with respect to the project location. So the project, as you can see, is located directly across from McKinley park, and this was really one of the principal reasons that my client thought this would be a good location for an adaptive reuse of these old buildings.

McKinley park is a beautiful park, very large, and frankly, there are very few residents of the city of Chicago that would benefit from being directly across from a public park. So the idea of having 120 units of affordable housing directly across from McKinley park was a real driver in bringing this development forward. Another reason is that the site is very close to transportation.

It actually qualifies as a transit serve location under the zoning ordinance, and there is a bus stop directly outside of the building, so it's really going to be quite easy for people to use public transportation. Also, I mentioned the adaptive reuse of these buildings, and that was clearly another important component of the project. Vacant unused buildings really add nothing positive to a neighborhood.

These buildings have been sitting dormant for decades. There's really no possibility to reuse them as industrial buildings, so using them as mixed use and as a residential building seemed like a wonderful idea. And finally, the reason was that McKinley park is in need of affordable housing.

The client team met quite extensively with Alderman Cardenas over the last several years. We know the alderman has really been pushing for affordable housing development in this location, so that was another reason. And finally, as you're looking at this slide, I do think we certainly want to stress and point out that Pershing Road has evolved over the past several years, and you can see that near us there are a number of different uses that have recently come into the area.

There's residential to the west of us. There are educational institutions on either side of our project, and there are still some traditional sort of commercial and storage uses on the strip, and we are located just to the north of the existing planned manufacturing district. And as those of you that those members of this committee that were on plan commission, you know there was a lot of discussion about that, and I'll speak to that in a moment.

Let's go to the next slide. This just gives you a sense of the scope of the buildings, the size of the buildings. You know, there are basically two almost mirror images of each other.

They're both six-story buildings. This redevelopment will be fixing the buildings and bringing them up to a really beautiful new standard, so that all of those broken windows that you see and all of the some of the tuck pointing issues will all be corrected. Let's go to the next slide.

So this is the site plan, and as I noted, there's two buildings. The building on the west, 21-59 West Pershing, is going to be totally reoccupied as a 120-unit affordable housing development. The building to the east will have commercial and office uses on the lower floors with some potential for residential above.

If you go to the next slide, we can see some of that. So this gives you a sense again to the top of your screen is the west building. That's the affordable residential.

It will have all of its parking inside the building at the first floor, and to the bottom of the screen, you can see sort of the open office, potential office layout and lobby area of the second building. Let's go to the next slide. This, we just kept this in to give you some sense of sort of what happens as the buildings go up.

The Parkview Commerce building, which is again to the east, the one lower on your screen, you can see that it has office and some loft space within it. The residential building Parkview lofts to the top of the screen. On the second floor through the sixth floor, we get all of the residential units, and the layout is really quite nice in the sense that all of the units have exterior views and all of the floors have storage space.

One thing that's really great is that we are able to incorporate on every floor bike storage. So there will be spaces for people to put their bikes on their floor in a storage area, and that was again a nice ability for us to really make this a transit-oriented development. Let's go to the next slide.

So on the previous slide, I didn't really point it out, but if you see between the two buildings, there is a space, and what's going to be done is the development of a new landscaped area, an outdoor area that will be basically enclosed. I mean it will be open to the sky, but it will be enclosed by the walls of the building, and it will really allow for and provide some open space. Notwithstanding that the property is across from McKinley Park, it's nice to have some sort of private open space, and the design you can see really will allow for some safe interior open space for the project.

Let's go to the next slide. So there was a great deal of discussion at the plan commission about the fact that our project sits very close to a planned manufacturing district, and in particular, it sits several hundred feet from the Matt Asphalt plant, which has a lot of issues, or I should say conversation going on in the community about Matt Asphalt. I would make it clear we are not part of, have nothing to do with Matt Asphalt, but we certainly were aware that Matt Asphalt was located in a nearby location, and as a result, early on, we began working with our team and with the city to make sure that we would do everything possible in the building to mitigate any issues with the fact the property was near or sort of in a transitional location.

This slide really highlights some of the sort of high level and critical things that we've done. We put in, we will be putting in a two-stage outside air filtration system, which again, we can speak to that in much greater detail if you'd like to, but it really will help clean and improve air quality coming into the building. There will be new insulated windows that will replace the original windows that are certainly not in any way performance windows.

We will have much better thermal performance and enhanced sound attenuation with the new windows. We will have significant landscaping that's going to be at the perimeter of the property. It's going to be a fast-growing landscape that we install so that there should be screening and sound abatement from those exterior issues to the south of us.

Obviously, I noted our interior landscape courtyard and the direct access to the public park is certainly something that will be helpful for people coming to our development. Let's go to the next slide. This just highlights some of the economic and community benefits that we see for the project.

First of all, as I noted, it's really going to remove a long-term blight to the neighborhood. This is 180,000 square feet of vacant space. It's going to be redeveloped and reused with 120 income-restricted apartments.

Let me just give you this for the record. We are going to be doing income averaging with the affordable housing. What that means is that there will be a range of affordable incomes that can live in the building.

12 of the 120 units will be affordable to people that don't earn in excess of 30% AMI. 40% of the units will be at the 50% AMI level. 48 units will be at the 60% AMI level, and 20 units will be at the 80% or below AMI level.

This is obviously a significant financial investment into the area of over $41 million just for the Parkview Lofts building. On Parkview Commerce, we do want to highlight that we will be providing commercial and office space options for small business users and obviously new employment opportunities for those users. We can go to the next slide.

There are two slides, this one and the one after it. As you know, the department provides recommendations to the plan commission. We got a positive recommendation from the department and they noted, I believe, a total of eight reasons for that.

You can see all of that is incorporated into the record now because you incorporated the records of the plan commission. With that, Mr. Chairman, I don't have anything further, but as I say, our team is here and we'd be happy to answer any questions you or any of the other committee members might have.

[Speaker 1] (3:16:39 - 3:16:53)
I see. Thank you, Steve. I see a couple of hands up.

Before we get to questions though, well, let me ask Alderman Cardenas, this is your ward, would you like to speak on it before we do some Q&A or do you want to wait until after?

[Speaker 5] (3:16:54 - 3:17:05)
I think I want to speak on it now. I think it's important for my colleagues to hear my efforts and my work. Can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (3:17:06 - 3:17:07)
Yeah. Proceed, please.

[Speaker 5] (3:17:08 - 3:21:18)
Thank you. I guess what I'm trying to say is I'd love my colleagues to hear some of the work that I've done in the community. I'm coming into my 19th year.

I've been serving with you, Chairman, for that long. I think you've been there longer than me. Throughout my tenure, there's many battles that obviously have come before me and we've withstood that and we're better for it.

I just want to address the environmental piece of it so people get an understanding of how sensitive I am to this issue. When I first was elected, there was a site, a brownfield site that was highly contaminated. It's in a little village.

I set to repurpose that site for a park because we knew that we could mitigate it, cap it, and turn it into a beautiful asset for the community. During those years, the battle was intense. It was drawn through several years.

In the end, we came away with a beautiful park right now that we're also set to create a fuel house to enhance even more this park. This park now houses a community garden on two acres in that site today. We've done the mitigating factors that were needed to accommodate it in something that was very much needed in the community.

In this case, although not the same, and I'm going to compare those two, but any environmental concerns that were addressed through mitigating factors, I made sure the developer went above and beyond what was needed to ensure that my residents, my constituents, people that are coming in are going to take advantage of this beautiful housing, would be housed in a high quality environment as they should.

Everything you see here, these buildings are solid. They're beautiful on the inside, but they need to be repurposed. I live but two blocks away.

In fact, out of my balcony, I can see the building from my balcony on Pershing Road. It's a lot of truck traffic. There's a lot of traffic.

Sometimes I come out and I enjoy a little bit of air. That's what people are going to see, the park, the environment. There's a school right next to my building where students from first grade all the way through high school get to attend.

A school that also created much consternation when I first brought it to the community and now has a thousand kids waiting for that high school or school to enter there. Such a high quality environment. Everything we do, we put our best foot forward to make sure that our constituents and people that are living within the community are getting the best of everything.

That's the same thing here. Many of you know me and I take great pains, I mistakenly step by step to make sure that what I'm doing is the right thing. I met through everyone with housing and development and planning and development and folks that are experts in this.

I assure you that the plan is we're going to set to develop McKinley Park. I hope that more mixed uses come along this way. There's no doubt other communities are benefiting from changes in the city and this community is no different.

We're going to debate to the end of time in terms of what's balanced, what's the right approach. The community is supporting it. I have letters of recommendations from most major organizations in the area.

I think it's just a great step. Buildings need to be repurposed and I think we ought to look for is how do we balance development with environment.

[Speaker 1] (3:21:21 - 3:21:25)
Alderman, I'm going to ask.

[Speaker 5] (3:21:26 - 3:21:52)
Every piece of it, this air quality ordinance that we passed, if you look at it, if you look everything is good. I appreciate you letting me speak. I think it's important for you to hear.

I'm taking a little bit of time with my colleagues, but I want them to know how passionate I am and I fully accept their support and appreciate their support. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:21:53 - 3:22:02)
All right. Okay. I have two hands up and we'll start with the first hand is Alderman Maria Haddon.

[Speaker 4] (3:22:02 - 3:27:53)
Thank you so much, Chair. Thanks Chairman Cardenas as well and Steve for the presentation. One, I want to say this development in the project and what you showed, it's beautiful.

I think this is a beautiful development. I think the adaptive reuse and the opportunity for that is fantastic. Every aspect of this project from taking advantage of that new ARO averaging and making sure that there are units affordable to people making 30% of the area median income.

All of these things are fantastic. I really appreciate and want to make sure, Steve, you guys hear that and Alderman Cardenas as well. I appreciate your statements and want to just put that on the record because my concerns aren't about the project in a bubble.

My concerns aren't around the work Alderman Cardenas has done to bring this project or the needs that he's expressed for his community. My concerns are the fact that there is an asphalt plant within 600 feet. My concerns are that our own department of housing, our public health department and others in our city administration have said that we wouldn't fund this.

We wouldn't fund this project with city dollars because of those concerns. I want to note a few of the concerns and this is from a written statement that our housing commissioner made to the plan commission. There's an active asphalt plant within 600 feet of the building.

There's the potential impacts of both odors and the truck traffic related to the asphalt plant have been observed by multiple commissioners during site visits. The US EPA's EJ screen index identifies areas with environmental justice concerns finds that this site exceeds 11 of their 11 indicators. The asphalt plant has had more than 50 complaint inspections completed due to emission odors.

Three violations have been issued related to air issues including odor and truck traffic has a direct consequence of the asphalt plant operations cause diesel emissions and odors. That's direct from our housing commissioner. We have denied city funding for this project not because it's not a good project in an LX space but because of these concerns.

We're also in the middle of an federal investigation with the department of housing and urban development about Chicago's prior practices of environmental racism when it comes to housing. I am only two years in city council and I know that sometimes we have difficult decisions to make around how things are impacting our wards and our direct communities and sometimes looking at the whole scale of the city. And I feel like I'm in a difficult place and I urge my colleagues to sit with me in that tension of I don't want to get in the way of new affordable housing being built in a colleague's community and also I don't want to be complicit in continuing to okay practices, bad practices, not just questionable but practices that we are already being investigated with, practices that have been proven to harm poor people, to harm black and brown people as we either decide to place major industry in our communities or look at placing and housing people actively right now next to a large environmental threat.

This is not only going hurt Chicagoans now but this will add to a history that we have of making these poor decisions which for those who aren't swayed by the environmental health risks to individuals, I think you might be swayed by the financial liabilities that this puts on us as a city. Chairman, I hope that we could actually hold this item and I would ask to hold this item. I would like to hear from our housing commissioner.

I would like to hear from our public health commissioner. I would like to hear from our sustainability officer Angela Tovar as well and I don't know if any of those folks are available to speak to us today to address these concerns but as a city council and as a committee, despite the work that's gone into this, we can't afford to place individual residents' health at risk, especially low-income residents, because of a good project or because of so much work.

So much work has been put into it but I believe with a little more time maybe we could have further discussions. Maybe there's a better site for this or maybe there's some other work to be done on the asphalt plant but right now I feel like it is reprehensible if we as a body decide to ignore everything that we know about environmental racism, about environmental impacts on people's health, about the carcinogens used and the manufacturing of asphalt and that we would think it's okay to just put low-income residents within 600 feet of an asphalt plant. I just want to note, Steve, in your presentation it was slide 25, the site context plan. Everything is labeled there except the asphalt plant and it's right there.

So Chairman, I'd ask that we hold this item and I'll leave it at that for now.

[Speaker 1] (3:27:54 - 3:28:04)
All right, so holding and you're basically asking to defer this item at this point from our committee?

[Speaker 4] (3:28:05 - 3:28:13)
I would ask to defer this until the next month but I know there are others to speak and I don't want to cut off debate at this point.

[Speaker 1] (3:28:14 - 3:28:41)
I'll ask you to renew your motion because we have one more hand up. What I want to hear I think is important from the applicant. You heard the questions about the environmental impact and I believe, Steve, you mentioned in your testimony so would you please for the committee try to answer the questions to the best of your ability?

And you have to unmute yourself, okay, Steve?

[Speaker 2] (3:28:42 - 3:30:39)
That would help, thank you. I would like to respond and I think also rely on some of our team members but to Alderman Haddon and any other members of the committee that have this concern, please understand that the project team have these concerns and this project was filed in April of 2019 as a planned development. We've been working with the city for obviously many months, a great deal of time and I would hope that committee members understand that to get a positive recommendation from the Department of Planning and Development that your department took into consideration all of these things.

Let me mention a couple of them and again then offer to anybody on our team to speak as well but we did do a report that was from a private firm, Specialized Ecological Services. They provided that report to us, we provided it to the city, it indicated that the asphalt plant is operated under best practices to meet or exceed regulatory standards and again I'm not here to defend the asphalt plant, I don't represent the asphalt plant, I'm just telling you we undertook steps to try and address this issue and we addressed it with the facts that were out there and that we were able to determine and the our report indicated that there are physical characteristics that mitigate any impact on our site based on certain physical characteristics of the location. The first is that the plant isn't directly adjacent to us, it's several hundred feet away.

[Speaker 1] (3:30:40 - 3:30:47)
I believe 600 which is a city block for practical purposes.

[Speaker 2] (3:30:47 - 3:32:46)
Correct. There are other buildings in between, there's an earthen berm between the plant at the plant location and then there was something else that our report noted which was kind of interesting and that is that the prevailing wind direction in this area historically only blows south west so toward our building about 7.7 percent of a year so most of the time the prevailing winds are blowing in the opposite direction from the building.

In addition, not only our report that we did but the city's AIS group did its own report and their report and I quoted this at the plant commission, I'd like to quote it again, they say AIS agrees the on-site regulatory records are not indicative of a recognized environmental condition and that matt asphalt LLC is sufficiently distant and shielded from the site to minimize risk. Based on those reports that we did and that we worked with the city on, we did work with the city on providing the mitigation standards that I noted in earlier in the presentation with respect to windows and our HVAC system and landscaping. Again, I can't speak for the department of housing and why it made the decision that it made but we've really tried to rely on facts.

The one thing I would request because I would like the opportunity and maybe Paul or Dan would be best to speak to this if Paul is on, is I understand that the Chicago has had bad practices before. This is not a team that is you know in that vein at all. Paul, are you on?

[Speaker 1] (3:32:49 - 3:33:07)
All right, well again, I know this was hashed quite extensively at plant commission. However, we'll have Paul speak. I have Alderman Jo Lopez and then if you want to entertain your motion to defer, we'll do a roll call on the deferral.

[Speaker 4] (3:33:08 - 3:33:12)
Chairman, just as a note, I do have a follow-up question if I may as well.

[Speaker 1] (3:33:13 - 3:33:24)
All right, well let's get Paul and then we'll get back to you and Byron and then if you want to re-entertain your motion to defer, then we can do it at that point. All right, Paul.

[Speaker 28] (3:33:25 - 3:35:53)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the opportunity to speak. So, I'm Paul Roldan, President of Hispanic Housing Development Corporation.

We are a 44-year-old non-profit organization that has developed housing here in Chicago, downstate Illinois, surrounding suburbs, Michigan, Indiana, Wisconsin and more recently in Puerto Rico. We have about 9,500 residents and our concern for residents, their safety, being provided an opportunity to become part of the economic mainstream is important. Their safety is first and foremost, obviously.

I am not an expert, you know, an environmental expert and so therefore I've relied on a number of reports that Steve had mentioned earlier. I can say one thing he didn't mention was that in 2002, the Environmental Protection Agency removed asphalt plants as a major source of air pollution. On top of that, we have the report from April 2020, Specialized Biological Services that found that there was no evidence of recognized environmental conditions that were hazardous at the subject property.

That's a private company. We have a clean air inspection from the EPA as well as a clean air report and then, of course, we have the city's own AIS report that Steve mentioned earlier. All those things, I think, speak to the fact that this development is certainly within, you know, three football fields of an asphalt plant, but the question is whether these urban pyramids that have been built before anybody on this meeting was born and will be around after we're long gone, whether we take on the responsibility to repurpose them into, you know, useful needs for the community and given that we are directly across the street from a park that has been there 110 years, provides softball fields, baseball fields, swimming pools, fishing, you know, this is the equivalent, Mr. Chairman, to a resort area in Palm Springs.

[Speaker 1] (3:35:53 - 3:35:59)
All right, that was, that was, yeah, that was enough for that one. Let me just say this. Chair, this is Cardenas.

[Speaker 5] (3:36:01 - 3:36:29)
Point of information. Chairman, this was debated at NAWAC's Human Plant Commission. We've been going through a year and almost two years on this development.

We've met with everyone but the moon and I think that, you know, there comes a time where action has to be taken and I ask for a vote in your consideration for a vote on this item today.

[Speaker 1] (3:36:29 - 3:36:43)
Thank you. Okay, well, we're going to get to that, but I want to get through a couple of questions from committee members and we've heard from Marie. We'll hear from her again, but let's talk to Byron Sitio Lopez.

Byron.

[Speaker 10] (3:36:43 - 3:40:09)
Thank you, Chairman, and I do want to second Alderwoman Cadden on the not only financial liability, but also health risk of being so close to the Mad Asshole Plant. I do think that being a neighbor, very familiar with this site, and again, when we talk about affordable housing, again, Alderwoman Cadden and I agree we do not want to oppose affordable housing anywhere, however, we also do not want to be complicit on potential real health risks that are involved given the proximity. So, I want to mention some important facts and I think I would like to, and I understand the applicant has said that they do not want to respond in terms of Mad Asphalt, but I do think that it's important to know some of the facts.

Mad Asphalt, this plant has the highest number of air pollution complaints that any other address in the city, 29 complaints. Since opening in 2018, there's approximately 138 complaints to 311 and, you know, definitely the proximity to any kind of residential proposal represents a real health risk. I understand that there has been a report by a private firm, however, I do think that it's critical that we hear from our public health experts, you know, the Chicago Department of Public Health, I know Alderwoman Cadden has talked about the Department of Housing and other agencies, I think that an impact study on the health impact of residents within the perimeter is critical.

I do think that just given the number of complaints, and again, there's also a report, I know my colleague Alderman Cadden has also mentioned that there are schools in a park nearby. Recently, there was another report by the University of Illinois in Chicago on the proximity of schools to polluters. Their danger that our children face and the permanent damage is extremely concerning.

As someone who represents an area, and again today, just today, I had the real painful experience, you know, when a funeral of a dear friend of ours that, again, died at 59 years old. I think that all of you who have family members, friends, residents, neighbors, will do anything that is within our power to make sure that our lifespan is not shortened because of these kind of factors that we can prevent. This has real implications and real damage in the health of residents.

We cannot have it both ways, unfortunately. We're either going to have residential, or we're going to continue to have an industrial side there. But you cannot have both.

And unfortunately, that's what we find ourselves, that's why we've been critical of some of these issues, because we cannot put people in danger. I'm extremely concerned about the danger and using private firms reports instead of public health reports by the EPA and the public health department. It is not the way to operate.

I would like to second all the women had to take more time on the design.

[Speaker 1] (3:40:09 - 3:40:39)
Oh, we're going to take we're going to take a roll call on that motion. But I do want to hear quickly from Walter Burnett, and then James Kaplan. And then I will ask Marie to just make the final comment before we'll probably take, we're going to do it.

We're going to do a roll call on the motion to defer. And then depending on the success or failure of that, we'll figure what the next steps are. All right.

Walter.

[Speaker 3] (3:40:39 - 3:44:00)
Yeah, thank you, Alderman. So I understand and I appreciate the concerns of my colleagues. You know, and I said this at the plan commission, I have a asphalt plant in my ward.

It's called Begaine. It's one of the largest asphalt plants in the city. It used to be called Palumbo.

I have million dollar homes, educated people who live less than a block away from these homes. Matter of fact, they built their houses right by the asphalt plant. Matter of fact, I had to compromise a meeting 24 years ago to allow for them to move next door to the asphalt plant because the asphalt plant was worried about them complaining about them.

Right. I have several other million dollar homes. It's over on Fry and Ogden.

I have several other million dollar homes within a block away from this facility. Never a complaint. I know people who have lived there.

I actually went to Wells High School with people who live over there all their lives, three and four generations. Their kids are my age. Right.

They lived there all their lives, never had a problem. They've been by the asphalt plant all their lives. We are actually getting ready to vote on a development, a very large development that is closer to this asphalt plant than this development is.

I know folks have these concerns, but I haven't found that having an asphalt plant, or should I say having housing next to an asphalt plant, to be detrimental to folks' health in my 26 years. I still have people developing and building million, almost $2 million homes next to this asphalt plant. The only complaint that I get periodically is the noise of the trucks when they idle it.

Outside of that, we have to resolve those issues that we have. We made it where they can't idle. Outside of that, I understand all of this new emotion going on with this environmental thing, which is very new.

I know environmental discrimination is not just for poor people, it should be for rich people too, or it should be for other folks too, but I never heard any complaints about it in these areas. That's why I supported this in the Department of Planning, because it would be disingenuous of me not to when I have allowed for million-dollar homes to be built next to an asphalt plant. They've been built, and people have been living there for over 20 years.

All right. Thanks, Walter. Alderman Kappelman.

[Speaker 41] (3:44:01 - 3:45:05)
Thank you, Chairman. I'm not from Chicago. I grew up along the Gulf Coast in Baytown, outside Houston.

In my neighborhood, the major industry in my community was Exxon oil refinery. Exxon oil refinery pumped a lot of the water from underneath the land to refine the oil. With a series of hurricanes, my neighborhood doesn't exist anymore.

It's completely destroyed. It's now become a bird sanctuary. I understand the environmental aspects of what it does, because it seriously affected my own family.

I looked at the Google Maps, and I am seeing a lot of homes, and I'm seeing that park there. I guess my question is, rather than a lot of hearsay, and people have their opinions, and they're going to have them, I need to have a clear understanding. What does EPA say about this asphalt plant being 600 feet away from this proposal?

Have they weighed in on this at all?

[Speaker 1] (3:45:06 - 3:45:11)
Okay. Steve, that's a question, a yes or no answer for the applicant.

[Speaker 2] (3:45:17 - 3:45:33)
Our studies show that EPA has not cited the project, the asphalt plant, for any violations. I actually don't know that EPA has weighed in on the question of whether our project should be there, but the city's AIS report did. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (3:45:34 - 3:45:38)
Good enough. Enough said. All right.

James, anything else?

[Speaker 41] (3:45:38 - 3:45:39)
That's it. Thank you, Chair.

[Speaker 1] (3:45:40 - 3:45:59)
All right. All right. I'm going to ask Marie to be the closure, because I know Byron has his hand up, but I'm going to ask Byron to defer to Maria, and then if it's her wish to move to defer, as I said, we'll take a roll call on that motion.

Maria.

[Speaker 4] (3:45:59 - 3:48:39)
Thanks, Chairman, and thank you for everybody. I appreciate everyone's comments. One point of clarification, I just wanted to mention some of those city and Department of Housing concerns were from Commissioner Navarro, and you can see that from some reporting from August in the Sun-Times, so I just want to say this has been out there, and clarification on that.

Also, just want to clarify, I respect my colleagues' experiences, and also, when we learn new things, we are responsible for incorporating it, and Mr. Rodin, I appreciate your comments, and really love your organization. You guys have a development in the 49th Ward, the James Snyder Homes, and I think you're fantastic, so I very much appreciate and believe in the sincerity of the people who put together this project, and their support, and their care for the residents that will live here. I'd say the commercial space looks great, and also, we don't have facts, to Kappelman's point.

It's my understanding that the Illinois EPA completely neglected their duty to do any kind of real process before they allowed the asphalt plant to move there in the first place. You know, I don't know if this is a question that DPD can answer for me, but given the air quality ordinance that we passed, if the situation were reversed, if the housing existed there already, I'm wondering, would we approve the location of the asphalt plant there? And so, my main argument here is, just because there are million-dollar homes next to asphalt plants doesn't mean that we, as a city council, because this is our decision, this isn't the decision of a developer, this isn't the decision of the plan commission, they've made their call, and it was pretty close.

This is the decision of city council members on the Committee on Zoning and Real Estate. Do you feel like you have enough information about the environmental impact? Do you, knowing that our public health department and our department of housing have outright rejected this project over those concerns, do you, knowing that the Illinois EPA did not go through their normal channels to approve the placement of this asphalt plant, do you feel comfortable approving this project now?

And that's my main question. I don't. I want to hear more.

I want to hear from the public health experts, because I want to feel satisfied, and if I'm able to give my support to this project, I want to be able to do it wholeheartedly. So that's all I ask. I'll renew my motion, Chairman, to defer this item.

[Speaker 1] (3:48:40 - 3:49:01)
Okay. Alderman Hadden makes a motion to defer this item. We're going to do a roll call on that motion.

Voting yes would mean that you want it deferred, and voting no would mean that you want it not to be deferred and to continue to have an up-down vote subsequent to that if we get to that point. So we're going to start the roll call.

[Speaker 5] (3:49:02 - 3:49:03)
Chairman Tunney?

[Speaker 1] (3:49:04 - 3:49:06)
Yes, Alderman Dowell. Chairman Dowell.

[Speaker 5] (3:49:07 - 3:49:18)
Is there an opportunity to get an EPA, I mean, is that even possible to get an EPA assessment or evaluation?

[Speaker 1] (3:49:19 - 3:49:25)
I, at this point, Chairwoman, we asked that question.

[Speaker 12] (3:49:25 - 3:49:26)
Is there like a letter?

[Speaker 1] (3:49:28 - 3:49:36)
According to the applicant. He didn't answer. The applicant didn't answer the question, so that's why I'm asking again.

[Speaker 5] (3:49:37 - 3:49:38)
Is it possible?

[Speaker 1] (3:49:40 - 3:50:47)
Is that a normal request? Could that be? It's not a normal request for the Zoning Committee, I'll tell you that.

I know, I know. The point being that, and I can't speak for Stephen, but what he said was that AIS had done the report and have found no environmental issues. I think the Department of Planning obviously made the recommendation to the Planning Commission.

Whoever voted on that, I think it was a seven to four in the affirmative at Planning Commission. I don't think Alderman, I'm sorry, our Housing Commissioner, I don't think she voted on the application and our person from the Department of Health is not a member of the Planning Commission. So with that being said, I'm going to move the question to defer and by a roll call.

And I'm going to start with Alderman Hopkins.

[Speaker 11] (3:50:48 - 3:50:48)
Mr. Chairman?

[Speaker 24] (3:50:51 - 3:50:54)
Yes, quickly, Alderman Beal.

[Speaker 12] (3:50:54 - 3:51:02)
I just wanted to, I mean, I don't think it's necessary that we take a vote to defer. It can be the ruling of the chair to just hold this in committee.

[Speaker 1] (3:51:03 - 3:51:07)
Well, I think with all due respect, I think I'm going to take a roll call. Okay.

[Speaker 9] (3:51:08 - 3:51:10)
Okay. All right.

[Speaker 1] (3:51:10 - 3:51:10)
Hopkins?

[Speaker 9] (3:51:11 - 3:51:13)
I vote no on the motion to defer.

[Speaker 1] (3:51:14 - 3:51:59)
Dow? Yes. Sawyer?

Alderman Sawyer, I'm sorry. Alderman Beal? No.

Alderman Ray Lopez? Aye. Alderman David Moore?

Alderman Mike Rodriguez? Aye. Alderman Sitio Lopez?

Aye. Alderman Raboyas? No.

Alderman Burnett? No. Alderman Cardona?

[Speaker 21] (3:52:02 - 3:52:03)
No.

[Speaker 1] (3:52:04 - 3:52:15)
I'm sorry, was that a no, Felix? Yes, no. Yes, so that's a no for Cardona.

Alderman Wagesbeck?

[Speaker 37] (3:52:15 - 3:52:15)
No.

[Speaker 1] (3:52:17 - 3:52:23)
Alderman Austin? Alderman Riley?

[Speaker 16] (3:52:25 - 3:52:26)
No.

[Speaker 1] (3:52:28 - 3:52:39)
Alderman Kappelman? No. Alderman Osterman?

And Alderman Hadden?

[Speaker 4] (3:52:40 - 3:52:40)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (3:52:42 - 3:52:55)
And I'm sorry, Alderman Villegas? Yes. And Chairman Toney votes no.

So what's our, what's our...

[Speaker 16] (3:53:11 - 3:53:12)
Somebody throwing a party?

[Speaker 1] (3:53:13 - 3:53:21)
Well, you know, we failed math 101, I think. What do we have, nine to four or 10 to four? Say again?

[Speaker 3] (3:53:21 - 3:53:22)
Nine to four.

[Speaker 1] (3:53:22 - 3:53:33)
Nine to four, so the motion is defeated. Now I'm gonna ask for a motion moved to pass by the same roll call that was used in the form.

[Speaker 4] (3:53:34 - 3:53:35)
Roll call vote, please.

[Speaker 1] (3:53:36 - 3:54:06)
All right, so we have another... Well, we have a motion to roll call this one, so we're gonna have to take the vote. This is to support the plan commission recommendation on the Pershing Avenue application.

Mr. Chairman? All right. Can I speak on the motion?

This is Alderman Hopkins. We have asked for a roll call, so would you please, quick, sir?

[Speaker 9] (3:54:07 - 3:54:38)
Yeah, just briefly, just... The asphalt plan is not before us. I'm sorry it's there, and I wish we were voting to cite it.

We are not. The picture you're seeing in my Zoom background, I took that picture with my Kodak Instamatic camera when I was 10 years old. And I have, obviously, a great sentimental attachment to McKinley Park.

I don't believe an asphalt plant belongs there. I do think people should live across from McKinley Park. I think the conversion...

[Speaker 1] (3:54:38 - 3:54:42)
All right, Brian, I get the life story, but I wanna get this voted on.

[Speaker 9] (3:54:43 - 3:54:57)
I'm expressing the reason why I'm supporting this, simply because I think people should live across from McKinley Park. And that's what we're voting to determine today, not whether or not it's appropriate to put an asphalt plant. And I'll start the roll call by voting aye.

[Speaker 1] (3:54:57 - 3:55:30)
Okay, Hopkins votes aye. Alderman Dowell? Aye.

Alderman Dowell's an aye. Alderman Sawyer? Alderman Beall?

Yep. Alderman Ray Lopez? Alderman David Moore?

David Moore? We'll get to you, Ariel. All right, Alderman Mike Rodriguez?

[Speaker 12] (3:55:31 - 3:55:31)
No.

[Speaker 1] (3:55:32 - 3:55:34)
Alderman Sicho Lopez?

[Speaker 37] (3:55:34 - 3:55:35)
No.

[Speaker 1] (3:55:36 - 3:55:57)
Alderman Burnett? Yes. Alderman Raboyas?

Yes. Alderman Cardona? Yes.

Alderman Wagespach? Yes. Alderman Riley?

Yes. Alderman Capelman?

[Speaker 41] (3:55:58 - 3:55:58)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (3:55:59 - 3:56:08)
Alderman Osterman? Alderman Villegas?

[Speaker 4] (3:56:09 - 3:56:10)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (3:56:12 - 3:56:41)
And Alderman Haddon? No. All right, so we have a little bit of a change there.

Oh, Chairman Tunney is a yes. So with that, 11 to 3, the motion carries, and will be reported out to the City Council tomorrow. All righty, thanks everybody.

[Speaker 2] (3:56:42 - 3:56:43)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (3:56:43 - 3:57:44)
All right, next is page 14. Let me see, we did the top. Yeah, bottom of page 14.

A document number 20593, 27th Ward, ordinance was referred on January 27th of 21. The common address 159 through 185 North Green Street, 801 through 825 West Lake Street, and 16, I'm sorry, 162 through 184 North Halsted Street. The change request, DS3 Downtown Service District and business plan development number 1359 as amended.

The DX7 Downtown Mixed Use District, and then the business plan development number 1359 as amended. Let me see, we have Mr. George or Chris Leach? Chris Leach.

Hi, Chris. All right.

[Speaker 13] (3:57:45 - 3:58:56)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee on Zoning Landmarks, Building Standards. My name is Chris Leach. I'm an attorney with offices located at 71 South Wacker Drive.

I'm sitting in for Jack George, who had to attend another meeting, he apologizes. I'm hearing this afternoon on behalf of the applicant, SC Lake LLC, in connection with the amendment to sub area B of business plan development number 1359. The subject property is located in 27th Ward and bears a common address of 817 through 825 West Lake Street and 177 through 185 North Green Street.

Before presenting the details of the proposed amendment, I would like to inform the Committee that this application received the unanimous recommendation of the Chicago Planning Commission at its meeting held on May 20th, 2021. And I respectfully request that the reported proceedings before the Planning Commission, together with all reports and documents that were previously transmitted to the Department of Planning Development, be incorporated into this hearing and made a part of the recording record of this proceeding. If we can make that motion, Jeremy.

[Speaker 1] (3:59:00 - 3:59:10)
Boyas, Moose, incorporate the records for the Planning Commission by the same roll call that was used in the determined form. Any objections? Hearing none, the records are incorporated.

[Speaker 13] (3:59:11 - 4:02:24)
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. On February 28th, 2018, the Chicago City Council approved PD 1359, consisting of sub areas A and B. Sub area A is improved with a 19 story mixed use development containing retail and commercial uses on the ground floor and office uses on the floors with an FAR of 12.52. The proposed amendment makes no changes to sub area A. The applicant seeks to amend sub area B of PD 1359 to add a parcel located at 817 West Lake Street to sub area B to enlarge sub area B from 5,041 square feet to 10,082 square feet. Sub area B is partially improved with an existing restaurant building located on one half of the sub area and a vacant parcel located at the Southeast corner of Lake and Green. The applicant seeks to redevelop sub area B with a seven story, 109 foot tall office building containing approximately 7,500 square feet of retail on the ground floor and office uses on the floors above with an outdoor amenity space on the seventh floor and an interim use of an approximately 5,000 square foot landscape outdoor patio for the existing Boulevard Steakhouse restaurant until the office building comes under construction.

The applicant will be taking a 4.5 FAR bonus on the property that is being added to the sub area for a total FAR of 6.2 for sub area B. The total FAR for the PD will remain unchanged at 11.5. The proposed development is in compliance with the West Loop design guidelines as well as being in compliance with the Chicago's sustainable development policy. The construction cost for the project is approximately $15 million and will create approximately 75 temporary construction jobs, five permanent jobs and will retain office jobs in the city as well.

The applicant is committed to achieving the NBEWBE participation goals of 26 and 6% and also in connection with the 4.5 FAR bonus, the applicant will be paying $529,269 into the neighborhood opportunity fund bonus. The applicant has met with the West Central Association, the West Loop Community Organization, the neighbors of West Loop and conducted a community meeting hosted by Alderman Burnett to obtain the support of the community and Alderman Burnett for this project. We believe the proposed amendment to the plan development meets all standards of the Chicago zoning code and we request your favorable recommendation.

On behalf of the applicant, I'd like to thank Alderman Burnett and the staff at PPD for all their hard work on this project and particularly Heidi Sperry. That's all I have. I'm happy to go through any of the slides if any of the committee members have questions and I thank you for your time and I'm standing ready to answer any questions that you may have.

[Speaker 1] (4:02:25 - 4:02:29)
Thank you, Chris. Alderman Burnett, would you like to speak on this?

[Speaker 3] (4:02:29 - 4:03:08)
Sure, thank you, Mr. Chairman. As the councilor said, they met with the three community organizations in my ward. We had a community meeting.

This project is pretty much a no-brainer. It's probably one of the smallest buildings that have been built in this area in some time and the developers, the owners of the property already own a fantastic restaurant and area and they pretty much are going to use the open space until they're able to build to have outdoor cafe. The whole community supported.

We ask for the committee's support also.

[Speaker 1] (4:03:11 - 4:03:22)
Thank you, Alderman. Questions for the applicant and the Alderman? Hearing none, can I get a motion?

Move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

[Speaker 39] (4:03:23 - 4:03:25)
Move to pass, Alderman Wagesback.

[Speaker 1] (4:03:25 - 4:03:56)
Alderman Wagesback moves to pass. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the item is passed as revised.

All right, we're almost done, folks. We are on page 15, top of page 15. Again, in the 27th ward ordinance was referred on March 24th of 2021.

Common addresses, 142 to 172 West Chicago Avenue. Oh, by the way, we're going to take these two together, correct?

[Speaker 37] (4:03:56 - 4:03:56)
Correct.

[Speaker 1] (4:03:56 - 4:05:46)
Okay, so this is the Moody Bible site. I'm going to read both addresses and applications and we'll take them as one since it is one development actually. So again, let's start over.

Item number 20650, 27th and 2nd ward. Ordinance was referred on March 24th of 2021. Common addresses, 142 through 172 West Chicago Avenue, 800 through 934 North LaSalle, 152 to 314 West Walton, 801 through 921 and 828 through 950, all on North Wells.

201 to 315 and 230 through 314, that's on Oak Street. And then 859 through 1037 and 930 through 1036 on North Franklin and 210 through 232 West Chestnut and 200 to 210 West Institute. That change request institutional plan development number 477 and C13 neighborhood commercial district to DX5, downtown mixed-use district, then to residential business institutional plan development.

And then the last application is document number 20656. Again, 27th ward. Ordinance was referred on March 24th of 2021.

This address, 876 North Franklin and its change request is institutional plan development number 477 to DX5, downtown mixed-use district. Katie Jankydale. And again, these are gonna be heard together.

[Speaker 17] (4:05:48 - 4:06:31)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon to you and the members of the committee. For the record, my name is Katie Jankydale from the locker room of DLA Piper.

And along with my colleague, Paul Shadle, we represent the applicants for this matter, North Union LLC and the Moody Bible Institute of Chicago. I am joined today. And I believe they need to be promoted to panelists by Jim Lechinger from JDL Development, Eric Holdquist from Moody Bible Institute and Sophie Bidek from HPA Architects.

As a preliminary matter, this application was considered and recommended for approval at the May 20th, 2021 plan commission meeting. And we would request that a transcript from that hearing be incorporated into the record today.

[Speaker 1] (4:06:35 - 4:07:03)
Oh, okay. We will take one motion for both applications on the referral from the plan commission. So Alderman Ravois makes the motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine form.

Any objections? Hearing none, these records are incorporated for both applications as revised. Thank you.

All right, Katie.

[Speaker 17] (4:07:03 - 4:08:20)
Next slide, please. So overall plan development is approximately 17 acres, generally bounded by the CTA Brown Line to the West, Oak Street to the North, LaSalle on the East and Chicago Avenue and Chestnut on the South. The properties are currently zoned PD 477 and C13 Neighborhood Commercial District.

We're requesting a rezoning pursuant to application 20656 of 876 North Franklin, which is the Southwest corner of Franklin and Locust. That property was previously conveyed by Moody to a third party, and it is just being removed from the plan development going forward. For the rest of the site, we're requesting a rezoning to a DX5 prior to establishing residential business institutional plan development.

Subarea A, which is shown in yellow on the screen in front of you, will be retained by Moody and approved for future development, which would be subject to site plan approval at that time. Subareas B through F, which are shown in purple on the slide on the screen, will be developed by JDL with a multi-phase project containing up to 2,656 dwelling units and approximately 15,000 square feet of retail space.

[Speaker 37] (4:08:20 - 4:08:21)
Next slide.

[Speaker 17] (4:08:24 - 4:10:08)
This shows an aerial of the overall proposed development B through F. And next slide. This shows the site plan, which includes over 2.5 acres of public open space and a sizable dog park at the north end of the site. This open space will be subject to a DEMA, which would guarantee public access. The applicant is also going to exceed the ARO by providing 236 units on site and an additional 118 units. We've worked with the Department of Housing to ensure that 20% of those affordable units will be accessible.

And the applicant has committed to preference the sale or lease of affordable units to individuals with disabilities and provided the optionality to provide larger units and units that are affordable at multiple income levels. Applicants committed to not only meeting the MNWV goals per the executive order, but is also going above and beyond by having 25% of construction hours performed by minority and female individuals and requiring contributions to workforce development organizations by their contractors, subcontractors, and developers. The team's been working on this since August of 2019 and engaged in DPD's master plan development process, which included significant outreach to the community and to community meetings that were co-hosted by DPD.

We'd like to thank the Department of Planning and Development, Department of Housing, Alderman Burnett, Alderman Hopkins, and the larger community for their help, leadership, and support throughout this process. As I mentioned, we do have our team on in case there are any questions. With that, we would respectfully request the committee's positive recommendation on these two applications.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (4:10:09 - 4:10:20)
All right, Katie. Alderman Burnett and or Alderman Hopkins, would you like to speak on this extra-large development?

[Speaker 3] (4:10:24 - 4:10:26)
I do have to come up with an ineligibility.

[Speaker 1] (4:10:26 - 4:10:27)
Sure.

[Speaker 3] (4:10:28 - 4:14:04)
I'm sorry, another meeting. So we're very excited about this development. We're very excited for Moody Bible, which has been in this community for many years.

I grew up right in the shadows of this area in Cabrini Green. Matter of fact, the funny thing is, I used to go to Moody Bible when I was a kid because the students used to come and get us and take us to play ping pong and games at the center and then trick us in order to read the Bible to us and teach us about Christ. So I have fun memories about this area.

So we used to frequent this area on our bikes and all kinds of things. I think for them to finally want to do something with all of this property is not only beneficial to them, but also beneficial to the city of Chicago. This developer has worked very holistically with myself and several community organizations in the community.

I'd like to commend the Department of Planning and the Planning Commission because we voted on a new process to deal with large developments like this. Matter of fact, this development not only took in the immediate community, but it met with all of the community surrounding this development for, I don't know, maybe a mile or two diameter. So many community organizations had input on this proposal and all of those things was taken into consideration.

This developer changed some things due to that input with his green space and affordability and jobs and all of the above, looking at the transportation and how to get through the streets. I mean, it was very, very holistic. I commend the developer on being so hands-on with the community and taking everything into consideration, even working with the immediate residents.

There's only one building right now that's very close to this. Meeting with them and taking them into consideration before he even met with everyone else. So I commend him on his due diligence in dealing with this.

At the Planning Commission, we had everyone that supported this, all of the community organizations supported. We had a community meeting over Zoom. What I think about with, I don't know how many hundreds of people was at the meeting, probably one of the largest meetings that I've ever been to in regards to a development and it was very positive.

So I support this. I ask for this body's support also and congratulations and thank everyone that's been involved, including my partner, Alderman Hopkins and his residents, which was the one building right next to it and Kitty Corner, the senior buildings and the not too far to senior buildings that's close to it also and the student building. So thank you very much for your cooperation and I'm glad to be your partner in this.

So I support this and ask for the committee support also. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (4:14:05 - 4:14:13)
Thank you, Alderman. Is Alderman Hopkins on the line and would like to say a few words? I think it encompasses some of his ward or adjacent.

[Speaker 9] (4:14:14 - 4:15:33)
Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman. It does. It's a majority 27th ward, but I do have a piece of it.

Nevertheless, Alderman Burnett and I worked as 50-50 partners throughout this process. It was a pleasure working with him. Also the community organizations that were involved in it, River North residents and NUP as well.

It was a robust process and as Alderman Burnett expressed, it resulted in substantive changes to the proposal as a direct result of community participation. The neighbors literally made this a better project. So we thank them for their involvement.

We thank them for their support. One thing that did come up repeatedly that many of the neighbors expressed a desire for a brown line station on Division Street. That is not a part of this project.

It can't be. We don't, this is not a TIF. So there's no additional funding that is being generated that could support those types of transit improvements.

But that is something we'll keep on the wishlist. And as this project goes forward, perhaps the new residents as they move in can join us in advocating for that needed transit improvement in the future. We'll keep advocating for that.

And I know Alderman Burnett feels as I do that that would be a good enhancement to brown line service in this area.

[Speaker 1] (4:15:33 - 4:16:26)
So with that, I'm in full support and I would urge an aye vote. All right. Any questions, comments from committee members?

I actually wanted to compliment the, I think JDL, right, is the group. As Walter said, though, I think what was this master plan where they actually took all the parcels and put the density on and not speculate. This is what they're upon approval.

This is what will actually happen on these parcels unless they actually come back to planning commission, I guess, with the change. Katie, I know you have a bunch of slides, but I selfishly wanted to see the row houses one. Is that easy for you to pick up?

Otherwise you can just send it to me.

[Speaker 17] (4:16:27 - 4:16:33)
Yeah, I think that we have, we included some renderings and we do have Sophie and Jim on.

[Speaker 1] (4:16:33 - 4:16:34)
There, it's right there.

[Speaker 37] (4:16:35 - 4:16:35)
Yeah.

[Speaker 1] (4:16:36 - 4:17:02)
Okay. I know it abuts the park space there, but I thought even though that they're basically all, well, there's two different types of townhouses, it just looks very, very attractive. I've got a couple of projects that I wouldn't mind showing them.

This is not only is the whole project architecturally significant, but I specifically like the way the townhouses are people.

[Speaker 41] (4:17:02 - 4:17:03)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (4:17:04 - 4:18:03)
Then I'll need to get a motion by the committee members to move do pass on these applications by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Move to pass. That is Alderman Hopkins makes that motion.

Any objections to the motion? Hearing none, both these items are passed as revised. All right.

I believe staff is at the end of our. Oh my mercy me. Why do we, how do we do that one?

All right, quickly. I'm sorry. Bottom page 16, application number 20594 in the 42nd ward.

Ordinance was referred on January 27th of 2021, 640 West Washington Boulevard is the address and the change request. DX seven downtown mixed use district business residential plan development.

[Speaker 20] (4:18:03 - 4:18:41)
Ted Novak or Mariah. Thank you. Yes, it's Mariah today.

Thank you. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Mariah Degrina with the law firm of DLA Piper.

I represent the applicants in this matter. 640 West Washington LLC, along with my colleague, Ted Novak. The property is located at the Northwest corner of Displains in Washington.

The application was considered and recommended for approval by the Chicago plan commission at a public hearing on May 20th. I would like to request that the transcript from that hearing be incorporated into the record of today's proceedings.

[Speaker 1] (4:18:43 - 4:18:56)
Alderman Raboia moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the records are incorporated.

Okay.

[Speaker 20] (4:18:56 - 4:21:08)
Thank you. The subject property is a 35,667 square foot site historically used as a public surface parking lot with 142 spaces. The lot was primarily used by weekday daytime commuters due to its location next to the expressway and just West of the city's downtown core.

The application seeks to establish a plan development at the site to permit development of a 47 story 413 unit residential building with ground floor retail space. The project would provide 137 enclosed parking spaces and approximately 8,000 square feet of ground floor retail and amenity space with additional tenant amenity spaces located throughout the building. The building does use the transit oriented development parking reduction to achieve the parking.

And if you could go to the third image which shows kind of the site, the next one, please. Perfect. The one of the features of the site is its internal drive aisle to bring cars off of the street so that traffic on Washington is unimpeded.

Another feature would be to remove an existing curb cut on displains which will promote the use of the bike lane on displains. And then as part of the community process, you can see on screen the yellow arrow dotted arrow on the left-hand side of the property is a new pedestrian walkway that was added at the request of community members. To continue on and you can continue through the renderings that appear after this.

The property is currently designated in the DX7 downtown mixed use district and would remain as the underlying zoning designation. The project would utilize an FAR bonus of 4.5 resulting in a total FAR of 11.5. The project will include 10 on-site affordable units and make a contribution to the city's affordable housing trust fund of approximately $5.8 million. The developer held meetings with nearby condo associations and community groups last summer and fall and presented at a community meeting this past February.

I'd like to thank Alderman Riley for his guidance throughout this process. I know he was planning to be present today to speak to his support for the project. I would respectfully request this committee's favorable recommendation that the application be approved.

[Speaker 1] (4:21:12 - 4:21:24)
I do have a letter of support for Alderman Riley but I believe he might be on the call. Brendan? I guess not.

[Speaker 16] (4:21:24 - 4:21:26)
No, I'm here. I'm here. Sorry.

[Speaker 1] (4:21:26 - 4:21:30)
Okay. All right, Brendan. We're up on the last item on West Washington.

[Speaker 16] (4:21:31 - 4:22:06)
Thank you, chairman. As council stated, this went through a very healthy public review process. This was not an up zone.

They're working within their existing zoning rights but are electing to purchase additional FAR for the project. It was well received by the community after a number of adjustments were made and certainly there were, I think, benefits that will be accrued to the immediate neighbors with some safer walkways, a better pedestrian experience. So all that said, I do support the project and I would encourage my colleagues to vote aye.

[Speaker 1] (4:22:09 - 4:22:22)
All right. Any questions for the applicant or Alderman Riley? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 22] (4:22:22 - 4:22:23)
So moved by Alderman Cardona.

[Speaker 1] (4:22:23 - 4:22:40)
Alderman Cardona makes that motion. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, this item is passed as revised.

All right. Now I need a motion to adjourn.

[Speaker 16] (4:22:40 - 4:22:41)
Alderman Riley so moves.

[Speaker 1] (4:22:41 - 4:22:52)
Alderman Riley makes the motion to adjourn. Any opposed to the motion? Hearing none, the meeting is adjourned.

Thank you for your patience and lively discussion. Thanks, Chairman.
