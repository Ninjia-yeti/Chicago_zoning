Good morning, colleagues.

[Speaker 1] (3:15 - 3:18)
We're going to wait just a few minutes to get our quorum.

[Speaker 1] (6:43 - 7:12)

[Speaker 14] (8:29 - 9:08)
All right. We have a quorum.

[Speaker 1] (9:08 - 9:29)
We'll now move on to the approval of the Rule 45 reports containing the minutes of the December 2021 hearing on the Committee on Zoning, Landmark, and Building Standards. All members of this committee should have received a copy of this report electronically. And if I hear no objections, do I have a motion by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum to approve the minutes?

[Speaker 14] (9:30 - 9:30)
So moved.

[Speaker 1] (9:31 - 11:48)
Alderman Austin. Alderman Carey Austin makes the motion. Any objections to our motion?

Hearing none, no objections, the report has been approved. Moving on, we will now hear the items to be deferred. I will read the ward, the file number, the address, and page number, and take a motion for all at the end.

On page two of the revised agenda, and page six of the regular agenda, in the 29th ward, file number 20897, for the address commonly known as 1100-1104 South Menard Avenue. Also on page two of the revised agenda, and page seven of the regular agenda, in the 20th ward, file number 20892, for the address commonly known as 6546 South Kimbark Avenue. Next on page six of the revised, of the revised agenda, and page five of the regular agenda, in the 35th ward, file number 20901-T1, for the address commonly known as 3110-331 Fault North Kedzie Avenue.

Next on page 11 of the revised agenda, and page 12 of the regular agenda, in the 25th ward, file number 19933-T1, for the address commonly known as 2824 West Cullerton Street. If I have no questions from committee members, can I get a motion to move to defer these previously listed items by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderman Kaplan makes the motion, any objections to his motion?

Hearing no objections, these items will be deferred. All right, we have two public speakers signed up for today's hearing, and we will hear from them now. The first speaker, James Nathean, so please, I'm sorry, I probably butchered that name.

James, are you on the call?

[Speaker 25] (11:52 - 11:53)
Chairman, he's not present.

[Speaker 1] (11:55 - 11:59)
All right, next speaker, Linda Konitz.

[Speaker 18] (12:02 - 12:03)
Chairman, she's not present either.

[Speaker 1] (12:10 - 12:21)
All right, we have, I think these speakers were going to talk on something in the second ward, but we do have a representative from Alderman Hopkins, want to be recognized?

[Speaker 14] (12:28 - 12:31)
Yes, hello, can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (12:32 - 12:33)
Yes. Identify yourself, please.

[Speaker 11] (12:34 - 12:39)
This is Brian Pellrine on Alderman Hopkins staff, we should have those two speakers.

[Speaker 3] (12:40 - 12:48)
I believe they didn't join the conventional way, they should be perhaps on the Zoom call here, as opposed to dialed in. Do we see anybody that might fit that description?

[Speaker 1] (12:51 - 12:54)
Not according to our committee staff.

[Speaker 31] (12:56 - 13:14)
Okay, I just spoke with one of them on the phone and he was joining, so I guess I will... This is tech support, if they are here under some different name, if they can raise their hand virtually, we can recognize. I see one that's raised right now.

[Speaker 3] (13:16 - 13:23)
Brian Ortiz, yes, he is with Americana Towers, which is one of the neighbors of the item.

[Speaker 13] (13:24 - 13:28)
Can you hear me? Is that Linda?

[Speaker 17] (13:28 - 13:32)
Yeah, I'm having trouble connecting to you all.

[Speaker 1] (13:33 - 13:35)
You're loud and clear, Linda. Would you like to proceed?

[Speaker 17] (13:36 - 16:26)
Yeah, I will proceed. Thank you very much. Good morning and thank you for allowing me to speak about the proposed zoning change for 1628 North Wells Street.

My name is Linda Konitz and I am president of the board of directors at Americana Towers condominium. Our building is located at 1636 North Wells Street. We are right next door to the north of the 1628 property.

Our section of Wells Street is made up of a mix of residential housing and commercial restaurant and bar or neighborhood tavern businesses that include the Second City Comedy Club. Throughout the year, before the pandemic, Wells Street would fill up with buses bringing visitors to see a show. It was not unusual to see three or four buses lined up on Wells Street dropping passengers off for the club.

All of the businesses have delivery trucks double parking on Wells Street, bringing in supplies and equipment all the time. Then if I include the rideshare cars that stop anywhere on the street for passengers and add in the neighborhood car traffic dodging what has become an obstacle course, I'm trying to illustrate to you how many different vehicles compete for access to our section of Wells Street. The proposal for a 30-unit residential development that does not provide off-street parking for their residents and does not have an alley or secondary entrance for garbage pickup or other maintenance vehicles means all of these activities will happen on Wells Street right next to the front of our building.

Moving vans will access the property from Wells Street next to the front of our building. Package delivery vehicles, UPS and Amazon, and all of the evening meal deliveries, they will all be jammed up at the Wells Street entrance with the potential of blocking our driveway or our neighbor, Concord Lane's driveway, because of a lack of drop-off space on the property. This will add more congestion and competition for space on this busy section of Wells Street.

I represent a community of residents that appreciate the vibrancy of our neighborhood. We are not against new development, but we can't be in favor of garbage trucks and other service vehicles accessing the 1628 property from Wells Street right next to the front of our building. We can't be in favor of this project, and respectfully, we request that it be denied.

Thank you.

[Speaker 14] (16:30 - 16:36)
Thank you. How about our first speaker, James Mahican-McKeon?

[Speaker 1] (16:37 - 16:47)
Or under that, what was it, what was it named? Is it under a different name?

[Speaker 30] (16:47 - 16:47)
No.

[Speaker 1] (16:47 - 17:50)
Okay. All right. That concludes the public speaking portion of the hearing.

We are going to start with the addendum to the agenda. We have one code amendment up before us, document number 020215872, the amendment of municipal code titles 2, 14a, 14b, 14r, and 14x, and repeal of chapter 13-9 regarding various technical corrections and modifications to the Chicago construction codes. This item has a substitute.

All members of the committee should have received a copy of the substitute as well as a summary electronically, and at this time, I would ask for a motion to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Move to accept the substitute. Alderman Hopkins moves to accept the substitute.

Any objections? Hearing none, the substitute is before us. We have Commissioner Beaudet here to present the matter.

Commissioner, you may proceed, please.

[Speaker 27] (17:52 - 19:54)
Thank you. Good morning, Chairman Toney and members of the Committee on Zoning Landmarks and Building Standards. My name is Matt Beaudet.

I'm the Commissioner for the Department of Buildings. With me online today is First Deputy Commissioner Marlene Hopkins and Managing Deputy Commissioner Grant Albrecht. I'm here today to ask for your favorable consideration for the technical corrections and modification amendments to various chapters of the Chicago Correctional Codes.

As you recall, the City Council approved the first major rewrite of the Chicago Building Code in 70 years, and that modernized code went into full effect on August 1, 2020. As promised, DOB has been working with all stakeholders as the new code was implemented in the permitting and construction phases to ensure that it meets the needs for safety, clarity, innovation, and flexibility, as well as any Chicago-centric needs. As we have since been implementing the new code, we have come before this Council when we have identified a need to clarify and enhance the new code.

This amendment package before you for consideration does just that. To provide a few examples, it clarifies that natural light and ventilation remains required in basement and courtyard dwelling units. It clarifies and continues our practice of not requiring natural light and ventilation in basement and courtyard non-dwelling units smaller than 70 square feet.

Neither clarification impacts the zoning code. It clarifies that 36-inch wide stairs are only allowed to serve stories with fewer than 50 people. It also clarifies that non-combustible exterior stairs, concrete or metal, may abut lot lines when allowed by the zoning code.

Further, in working with the Department of Streets and Sanitation to expedite the demolition of dangerous and unsafe garages, DOB will assume all duties related to demolition of dangerous and unsafe garages, utilizing our existing demolition process and contractor pool. I believe the above and other items in the technical package were provided by the committee members in a one-page summary. I thank you for your time and ask for your favorite consideration and I'm happy to answer any questions.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (19:55 - 20:08)
Thank you, Matt. We have questions for the Commissioner. I see Raymond Lopez's hand is up.

Is that to be recognized for quorum or do you have a question for the Commissioner?

[Speaker 19] (20:10 - 20:15)
That is for the purposes of being added to the quorum to say hello to the Commissioner.

[Speaker 14] (20:16 - 20:19)
Hello, Alderman. Thank you. Thank you, Raymond.

[Speaker 1] (20:21 - 20:25)
I see Chairman Wagespac has Scott.

[Speaker 9] (20:25 - 20:29)
Chairman, I just wanted to be recorded as present for quorum.

[Speaker 14] (20:29 - 20:31)
Thank you. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (20:34 - 21:32)
As I can say, Commissioner, in our briefing, these were pretty innocuous changes and further clarifications. I feel comfortable with at least my briefing on it and I know the one-page summary is pretty accurate on that. I got David Morris' hand up.

David? I just want to be recognized for quorum, Chairman. Yes, sir.

You will be recognized. Any questions on the building code changes? No questions, so moved.

All right. No more questions, no hands up. Alderman David Moore moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the ordinance is passed as amended.

[Speaker 27] (21:34 - 21:35)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members.

[Speaker 1] (21:36 - 22:29)
All right, thank you. Next, we have two requests for fee waivers of historical landmark district property. I will read them out separately and take a motion for them together.

In the second ward, document number OR2021-377, located at 1106 North Point Avenue. And in the fourth ward, document number OR2021-385, located at 3402-3404, I believe. Oh, I'm sorry, 3402-3402.5 South Giles Avenue. We have Michelle Rhimes from the Department of Planning and Development here to answer the questions. If there are any questions by committee members. So, Michelle, do you want to briefly go through these two?

[Speaker 21] (22:30 - 23:39)
Certainly, Mr. Chairman. Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. The first project is in the second ward.

Mr. Gregory and Mrs. Rainey proposed to expend $600,000 for the deconversion of their 2,400-square-foot, two-story, two-unit masonry building into a single-family residence. They are seeking a permit fee waiver in the amount of $3,800. The second project is located in the fourth ward.

Dr. Mark Freeman proposes to expend $400 for interior renovations, including new electrical, plumbing, HVAC equipment and systems, as well as the restoration of historical features of his building. He also proposes to construct an iron three-story deck at the back of the residence and out of sight of the street front of the building. He is seeking a permit fee waiver in the amount of $3,000.

[Speaker 1] (23:42 - 23:44)
Michelle, no visuals on the two properties?

[Speaker 21] (23:45 - 23:47)
I can definitely share them.

[Speaker 1] (23:47 - 23:50)
Please. We'll start with the one on Giles.

[Speaker 21] (23:50 - 23:55)
Okay. One moment, please.

[Speaker 14] (24:20 - 24:31)
One second, please. Please let me know when you can see it.

[Speaker 21] (24:36 - 24:38)
Can you see it, Mr. Chairman?

[Speaker 1] (24:39 - 24:41)
Not the photo yet.

[Speaker 21] (24:46 - 24:47)
Can you see it now?

[Speaker 34] (24:48 - 24:49)
Can you see it?

[Speaker 21] (24:49 - 26:11)
You can see it? Wonderful. All right.

Sorry about that. This is the first project that's located at 1106 North Point. It is in the second ward.

This is the facade of the building and the frame garage. They wish to demolish the frame garage and create a brick garage. They intend to do facade improvements.

Here's a site plan. They want to restore the historic features to the front of the building, including the porch and windows. The second one is the one that's in the Calumet-Giles Prairie Landmark District.

This is the one at 3402 and 3402.5. The picture that you see on your left is a historic photo from our archives. The second one is a Google Earth photo that was taken in 2008. This is a site plan for the interior restoration work.

Whoops. Let me go back. That's fundamentally the picture.

They just want to restore the front windows. They want to do mostly interior work. And as you can tell, the exterior rear is not visible from the street.

That's where they want to construct a three-story deck.

[Speaker 1] (26:13 - 26:28)
All right. Thank you for the visuals. Do we have any questions for the department?

Michelle? Ryan? Nope.

No questions. Can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 20] (26:28 - 26:30)
Moved to pass, Alderman Wagesback.

[Speaker 1] (26:30 - 26:38)
Alderman Wagesback makes the motion. Any objections to the motion? Hearing none, the orders are passed.

[Speaker 21] (26:39 - 26:40)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (26:41 - 27:04)
And now we're moving on. We have one historical landmark designation in the 12th Ward. Document number 02021-5408 for the Little Village Arch located at 3100 West 26th Street.

We have Daniel Klaber here from the Department of Planning and Development to present on this matter. Daniel?

[Speaker 22] (27:06 - 27:09)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman. Can you hear me okay?

[Speaker 1] (27:10 - 27:10)
Yes, sir.

[Speaker 22] (27:11 - 27:21)
Great. Actually, the screen share is not enabled at the moment for me. If someone could.

[Speaker 10] (27:22 - 27:23)
It should be enabled now.

[Speaker 22] (27:26 - 27:40)
Great. Yes, thank you. It is.

Can you see my screen okay?

[Speaker 1] (27:41 - 27:43)
Yes, we do.

[Speaker 22] (27:43 - 30:08)
Great. Thank you. Okay.

Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. Dan Klaber, Department of Planning. I'm here this morning with a proposed ordinance for the designation of the Little Village Arch as a Chicago landmark.

To help orient you, the arch is located five miles southwest of the loop in the South Lawndale community area in the Little Village neighborhood between South Troy Street and South Albany Avenue. It is owned by the City of Chicago and CDOT, Chicago Department of Transportation, fully consents to and is supportive of the designation. At its meeting in November 2021, the Commission on Chicago Landmarks found that the arch met three criteria for designation, including for heritage, architecture, and architect.

Regarding heritage, the arch was constructed in 1990 as a gateway to what is referred to as the Mexican capital of the Midwest, and it identifies the living heritage and culture of the community. Regarding architecture, the arch resembles the arched entrances found in Mexican architecture, as shown here. In addition to open chapels, such arches are also found in Mexican towns that were walled.

And regarding architect, the Little Village Arch was designed by Adrian Lozano, a Chicago artist and architect of Mexican descent. Although Mr. Lozano's career has not been well documented, it is known that in addition to the arch, Lozano contributed to two other buildings in Chicago, the Benito Juarez Community Academy and the National Museum of Mexican Art. Lozano was also a significant artist.

At age 20, in 1941, he painted the mural depicted above, titled The Progress of Mexico, which was located inside the Benito Juarez Clubroom at Hull House. Though the work no longer survives, it is significant as the first manifestation of Mexican muralism in Chicago. The Little Village Arch is located in the 12th Ward, and Alderman Cardenas has expressed his strong support for the proposed designation, as well as the Little Village Chamber of Commerce.

In conclusion, staff recommends that the significant features be identified as all elevations, including the roofline of the arch. You have a proposed landmark designation ordinance to that effect. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (30:09 - 30:19)
Thank you, Dan. I know we have Alderman Cardenas from the 12th Ward. Alderman, would you like to speak on this?

[Speaker 31] (30:20 - 31:22)
I'll be brief, Chairman. This has gone through the Committee on Landmarks and obviously got a very favorable review and approval. I'm here just to give thanks to and finally acknowledging contributions from phenomenal artists and architects like Mr. Lozano and other civic and political leaders that started this many, many years ago in the 90s, including now Congressman Trudy Garcia and others. But more importantly, the city finally acknowledging such an asset and then putting the funding in place so that we can refurbish it and improve it for the next generation of Mexican and Mexican American in our community as a whole. So I'm part of that, and I hope to receive a favorable vote from the Committee on zoning this morning. So thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (31:25 - 31:26)
Alderman Mike Rodriguez.

[Speaker 8] (31:31 - 33:53)
Thank you, Mr. Chair. And, you know, I just want to congratulate Alderman Cardenas and the suffragette. I join him as, you know, the fact that I am the alderman of two-thirds of Little Village, but I don't quite get this part of it.

George has that honor. But we work well together on these types of matters. And I have to say that my community, you know, sees this arch as an important place for our neighborhood.

Mexican Americans from throughout the Midwest see 26th Street as their landing point, the place where they feel most comfortable to come and shop, to come and eat, to come and live and work. And this arch means so much to the residents, not just of Little Village, but to the Mexican American community throughout the Midwest United States. I'm glad Alderman Cardenas has spearheaded this effort.

The Little Village Chamber of Commerce, Congressman Chuy Garcia, and many of our elected officials and local organizations come together to state that this is an important designation. This arch is recognized not just here in the city of Chicago and not just in our region, but throughout the Midwest as an important, very important architectural figure for our community. And the landmark designation is very important.

I will also say that our community has been suffering greatly due to coronavirus, disproportionately to gang and drug violence, particularly, as we all know, with the shooting death of a young girl in my community, not several days ago. But to cast a positive light on our neighborhood and to look at the strengths and build off those strengths to address some of those issues, part of which is recognizing the architectural treasure and the economic impact that 26th Street has, but the architectural treasure that the arch is. So thank you again, Chairman, for allowing me to speak.

Thank you, Alderman Cardenas, for spearheading this effort. Very well taken in our community.

[Speaker 1] (33:55 - 33:57)
Thank you, Mike. Alderman Raymond Lopez, please.

[Speaker 19] (34:00 - 35:16)
Thank you, Chairman. I, too, wanted to congratulate both Aldermen that represent Little Village, but in particular Alderman Cardenas, in getting this landmark status approved. I don't want to belabor the point, but I just want to point out one note that most people may not know.

Is that that clock, the iconic clock in the center, actually has to be repaired and can only be repaired by one person from Mexico. That individual comes and helps to maintain it, helps bridge the connection between Mexico and Little Village. And I think that's very significant because this is more than just an arch.

This is a connection for a community and for someone like myself who's passed under that arch, both in official functions and just walking by to get to El Milagro. It's something immediately recognizable, and I think it's about time the city funds it as the treasure that it is. The other part, Chairman, if I could just ask when speakers are speaking if we could see their faces as well.

So I'd appreciate being able to see who's presenting before us. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (35:20 - 38:00)
All right. Any other questions, comments? All right.

Can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderman Mike Rodriguez makes the motion. Any objections to his motion?

Hearing none, this ordinance is passed. All right. Moving on, we have large signs over 100 square feet in area, 24 feet above grade.

We will hear them all together. I'll read the ward followed by the address and take a motion at the end. Please note that I will hear the item in the eighth ward separately as it was submitted with a typo and resulting in the need for a substitute.

So with that in mind, we will start in the first ward. We have three signs in the first ward located at 2606 North Elston Avenue. Also in the first ward, 2048 North Milwaukee.

Moving on to the fifth ward, 2101 East 71st Street. In the 27th ward, 1454 West Randolph. In the 29th ward, 6515 West Grand Avenue.

In the 42nd ward, 14 West Hubbard Street. And also in the 42nd ward, 108 North State Street. Do we have any questions by committee members on these signs?

No questions. Can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderman Roboyas makes the motion.

Do pass. Any objections? Hearing none, these orders are passed.

Now I'm going to go back in the eighth ward, 0R2021-372. This sign located at 7546 South Stoney Island Avenue. As I previously stated, the order was substitute with an error and will need to be substituted today.

At this time, I would ask for a motion to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Alderman Roboyas makes the motion to accept the substitute. Any objections?

Hearing none, the substitute is before us. If there are any further questions on this sign, I don't have any more questions. I need a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

[Speaker 19] (38:01 - 38:02)
So moved, Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 1] (38:03 - 39:09)
Alderman Lopez moves to pass as amended. Any objections? Hearing none, the order is passed as amended.

We will now move on to the regular agenda in an effort to minimize technical difficulties and to ensure the committee meeting runs as smoothly as possible. The typical order in which items will be heard has been updated. Throughout the duration of virtual committee on zoning meetings, items will be grouped together according to witness attorney and will be heard in that order rather than ward order.

We have a few aldermanics on page one. We will start with document number A8723. In the 34th ward, ordinance was referred on September 14, 2021 in the common address 400 West 107th Street to change request from an M-1-1 limiting manufacturing district to an RS-2 residential single unit detached house district.

We have Alderman Kari Austin.

[Speaker 14] (39:09 - 39:50)
Kari, do you want to speak on this one? Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning, members of the committee.

Mr. Chairman, we're asking to rezone this because in that stretch of our ward, it's primarily residential. We only have two locations there that are commercial, manufacturing, but business-wise. I would like to down-zone that so when a company come, at least the community will have input on what is designated in their area.

Right. Future land use. I got a few, I'm sorry.

[Speaker 19] (39:51 - 39:52)
Bless you, Chairman.

[Speaker 14] (39:53 - 39:53)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (39:54 - 40:06)
All right, questions for the alderman? Alderman? Nope, no hands raised.

Can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 32] (40:07 - 40:09)
So moved, Alderwoman Haddon.

[Speaker 1] (40:09 - 40:16)
Alderwoman Haddon makes the motion. Any objections to her motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

[Speaker 14] (40:16 - 40:20)
Thank you very much, Alderman Haddon and the committee members.

[Speaker 42] (40:20 - 40:21)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (40:22 - 40:54)
Thank you, Raymond. I don't know where this sneezing is coming from. All right.

Okay. Second item on page one, document number A8735. In the 25th ward, ordinance was referred on November 17th of 2021.

The common address is 2150 South Lapland. And the change request. Institutional plan development number 1054 to institutional plan development number 1054 as amended.

We have Alderman Sitio Lopez. Byron?

[Speaker 14] (40:54 - 40:59)
Yeah, thank you. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 28] (40:59 - 41:37)
Yes, this request was in coordination with the Chicago Public Schools. The goal is to make sure that the zoning on the parking lots adjacent to Benito Juarez High School are in line with municipal code. So the language basically changed on a maximum of, I believe, 100 plus parking spots to a minimum of 100 plus parking spots.

So it is just an amendment. And we have discussed this with the Chicago Public Schools as well. So I'll ask my colleagues for a favorable vote on this item.

Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (41:38 - 41:47)
Thank you, Alderman. I think we have Scott Bornstein on the call representing this change also. Scott?

Yes.

[Speaker 42] (41:47 - 41:48)
Can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (41:49 - 41:49)
Yes, we can.

[Speaker 26] (41:50 - 43:08)
Great. I don't see that my camera is on. So I apologize to Alderman Lopez.

But in any event, this was an amendment that the Alderman coordinated with the Board of Ed. And again, we appreciate the Alderman's support and assistance. It was a technical amendment.

And the reason is because when the plan development was originally passed, it provided in our bulk table that we would have a maximum of 105 parking spaces when in fact we have 150. And then we're doing some work on the site, which I don't know if we have our slide presentation, but we're doing some repair work on the site, which is going to reduce the parking slightly, but we still are going to have more than 105. So the bulk table needed to be changed to provide that we're going to have a minimum of 105 spots.

That's the whole purpose of this amendment, just to change the bulk table. And so, by the way, just for the record, so it's all clear, this was recorded to be heard by the plan commission. And there's a substitute as well.

And so I would ask that all the records and findings of the plan commission, including the substitute, be incorporated into today's record.

[Speaker 1] (43:09 - 43:24)
So Alderman Siccio-Lopez moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine form. Any objections to that? So hearing none, the records are incorporated.

Is there any more testimony?

[Speaker 26] (43:25 - 43:51)
We do. We're joined by Evan Smith, who's the director of planning and development for the board of ed, and also our engineer of record, Chris Neal, who's here. And again, I don't know that our slideshow is available, but we can talk about what we're doing.

If the committee feels it's necessary, but as I said, the trigger for the PD amendment.

[Speaker 1] (43:52 - 44:19)
No, I think, I think we're, we're pretty clear on the changes, tactical and some of the revisions to the, to the, to the campus. And I know we have Alderman Siccio-Lopez is obviously avid support since it's Aldermanic, but do we have any questions from committee members on this? So hearing none, can I get a motion to move, do pass the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 14] (44:21 - 44:41)
Sawyer moves. Alderman Sawyer moves. Sawyer moves.

okay. Any questions? Okay.

Sawyer moves. These, this item is passed as revised.

[Speaker 1] (44:41 - 44:42)
All right.

[Speaker 14] (44:42 - 44:44)
Thank you so much. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (44:45 - 45:33)
Bottom of page one, document number eight, eight, seven, three, one in the 24th board ordinance was referred on October 14th of 2021. Common addresses, 3201 through 3243 West Ogden Avenue, 1800 through 1812, South Headsy Avenue, 1800 through 1813, South Sawyer Avenue, 1800 through 1813, South Christiana Avenue, and 1839 through 1847, South Holman Avenue. The change request, institutional plan development number 833, institutional plan development number 833 as amended.

Alderman Michael Scott, are you on the call?

[Speaker 6] (45:34 - 46:32)
Michael? Yes, sir. Good morning, Mr. Chair and members of the committee. This zoning change is the 10th district police station that is on Ogden. We want to amend this PD so that we can build a 100% affordable housing development there with Grace Jerusalem Development Corporation as well as Eastlake Management. So what we're doing is taking the far west parking lot because they have approximately five blocks of five square blocks of city land that the police station as well as the parking lot sit on.

They have four really large parking lots. We're taking the furthest west parking lot, amending that PD so that, again, we can build the affordable housing. We would love the committee's support on that.

Thank you, Mr. Chair.

[Speaker 1] (46:35 - 46:48)
Michael, so what we'll do, we'll take a motion on this and then we'll actually get to the nuts and bolts of the project with your team if your team is ready to present on the second half of this.

[Speaker 6] (46:49 - 46:57)
Okay. If they're ready, I'm ready as well. I would love to be able to show the committee the rendering and what it looks like.

[Speaker 1] (46:57 - 47:06)
Yeah, it'll make sense. We'll put the two together. But do we have any questions on the Aldermanic?

Hands up. Harry Osterman.

[Speaker 38] (47:08 - 47:22)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Question to Alderman Scott. Is this another building that's going to add affordable units in your ward to help stabilize your neighborhood and have affordable housing for your residents?

[Speaker 6] (47:23 - 48:11)
That is correct. It is 100 percent affordable housing. It's going to be 64 units, as you will see in the rendering.

It is a very, I think, very dignified, very classy building once you see the renderings. It has been touted as one of the best affordable housing developments that one will see. I didn't want to get ahead of myself.

I just wanted to talk specifically about the PD. But once we get into the nuts and bolts of the plan, you will see it is 65 units of affordable housing that is going to stabilize a community that has lost, I would say, in the last 100,000 in the last 100 years. But in the last 10 to 15 years, we also lost another 50,000 in population.

And this is just a small step into bringing some of that population back to the 24th Ward that is desperately needed.

[Speaker 38] (48:12 - 48:32)
It's an exciting, another exciting proposal in your community and all for it. And I think also, if I'm not mistaken, Ogden's got some CTA stations there as well. So hopefully it has close proximity to public transportation.

But it sounds like another great proposal and congratulations. Thank you very much, sir.

[Speaker 1] (48:32 - 48:53)
Thank you, Alderman. And what I'm going to procedurally wise, I've got to move to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine form. So that's step number one.

Any objections to the move, Chairman? Who was that that made the motion?

[Speaker 19] (48:53 - 48:54)
Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 1] (48:55 - 49:18)
Alderman Lopez makes the motion to incorporate the records of the plan commission. Any objections to that motion? Okay.

No objections. The records are incorporated. We will now on the Aldermanic, not on the project, on the Aldermanic, can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine form?

[Speaker 31] (49:19 - 49:20)
So moved.

[Speaker 1] (49:21 - 50:14)
Alderman Hatton makes the motion. Any objections to her motion? Hearing none, this item is passed as revised.

All right. So now, committee members, we are moving on the actual project itself to page 12, and I'll read it into the record, document number 20852 in the 24th ward. Ordinances referred on October 14th of 2021.

Common address 3401 to 3423 West Ogden Avenue. Also 1842 to 1854 South Holman and 1901 through 1909 South Trumbull Avenue. The change request, plan development number 833 to B33, community shopping district, then to residential business plan development.

Amy Degnan is the attorney on the case.

[Speaker 14] (50:14 - 50:24)
Amy? Hello? Can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (50:24 - 50:25)
Yeah, we can hear you now.

[Speaker 18] (50:26 - 52:04)
Okay, great. Thank you so much. Good morning, Chairman Tunney and members of the Zoning Committee.

My name is Amy Degnan, and I am an attorney with Georges and Sinowicki in Chicago. I'm appearing on behalf of the applicant, Eastlake Management and Development Corp on application 20852. Present with me is the applicant, Ethan Lassiter of Eastlake Management and Development Corp and project architect, Aaron Spearing of JGMA.

The project site is approximately 26,792 square feet and is bound by the north by Ogden Avenue, on the east by Holman Avenue, on the south by an alley, and on the west by Trumbull Avenue. The property is currently zoned Institutional Plan Development 833, which is the site of the 10th District Police Station. We are removing the 26,792 square feet from the site, which currently serves, as the alderman said, as an unused parking lot for the 10th District Police Station.

We're changing that subject site to a B33 and then to a Residential Business Plan Development. The applicant is proposing a six-story, 65 residential unit building with 18 parking spaces and ground floor retail and community space. The project, as the alderman said, is 100% affordable and located in the city's Invest Southwest Corridor.

Please allow me to introduce Aaron Spearing of JGMA to walk you through the highlights of the project.

[Speaker 14] (52:06 - 52:12)
Thank you, Amy. Can everybody hear me? Next slide, please.

[Speaker 30] (52:14 - 53:12)
So here we can see the site plan of the project, Ogden Avenue to the north. Ogden Avenue also happens to be the original Route 66. So as you see on the next slide, we'll see some of the energy of Ogden Avenue into the design and the facade of the building.

Back to the site plan, please. So along Ogden Avenue, we have a nice, broad, welcoming landscape area to invite the residents into the site, but also other parts of Ogden Avenue, some of the more public programs on the ground floor. On the west half of the building, there's amenity spaces and a community center, and on the east half is retail spaces and potentially a cafe with outdoor seating.

The tenants will come into the building through the middle entry there, and then parking is around back, tucked in under the building. So we don't have any sort of surface lots or anything like that on the site. The whole site is integrated into the design.

[Speaker 14] (53:13 - 53:19)
Next slide, please. And here you can see, looking

[Speaker 30] (53:19 - 53:40)
south from Ogden Avenue, the broad sort of landscaped area at the front, and then all the retail and commercial space on the ground floor and the tenant spaces above, using the vibrant colors to not only reflect the energy of Ogden Avenue, but to sort of blend the building into the landscape, going from greens to blues, plantings and

[Speaker 14] (53:40 - 53:51)
landscape up to blending into the sky above. Next slide, please.

[Speaker 30] (53:54 - 54:18)
This is the summary of public benefits with the estimated construction jobs and then permanent jobs with the commercial spaces, and then a summary of the affordable units. I also want to point out the entire design team was minority and women-owned. And then, of course, complying with all that through the construction jobs and permanent jobs as well.

[Speaker 14] (54:22 - 54:28)
That's our entire presentation, so I'm open to taking questions now. Can I go back?

[Speaker 1] (54:29 - 54:30)
Yes, Amy.

[Speaker 18] (54:30 - 55:30)
Oh, thank you so much. We're very excited about this 100% affordable housing project in the Invest Southwest Corridor. As Alderman Scott said, this is a collaborative effort between Pastor Hunter of Grace Jerusalem CDC and Eastlake Management and Development Corp.

Subject to the plan development approval, all bulk use and density items will be in compliance with the zoning ordinance. The developer participated in a community meeting hosted by Alderman Michael Scott and received incredible community support. We'd like to thank Alderman Scott for all of his leadership and guidance through this development process.

The application was presented to and received the recommendation of the Chicago Plan Commission at its meeting on January 20th in 2022. I ask that the report of proceedings before the plan commission, together with the reports and drawings previously transmitted to the Department of Planning and Development, be incorporated and made as part of the proceedings.

[Speaker 1] (55:32 - 55:47)
Alderman Osterman moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the records are incorporated.

I know we have a couple of questions. Amy, are you finished with your presentation?

[Speaker 18] (55:47 - 56:04)
I was just going to quickly close, Chairman, if that's okay. Alderman Michael Scott provided a letter of support for this application. I have forwarded that letter to the committee staff.

Obviously, he's here to speak on behalf. And then on behalf of the applicant, we request your favorable recommendation and we're available to answer questions.

[Speaker 1] (56:04 - 56:17)
All right. So, Alderman Scott, you did opine on this earlier. Is there any more facts or information on this project for the committee?

[Speaker 6] (56:17 - 58:02)
Yes, Mr. Chair, if willing. Again, I want to thank you for allowing me to speak and I want to thank Pastor Hunter and the Grace Jerusalem Church as well as East Lake Management and their development team for, I think, a spectacular development that is going to be in the Southwest Corridor on Ogden. Right across the street from the RFP that we're doing, the London Redefined.

So, right there in that little corridor, we will have over a hundred units of affordable housing. For folks in our community, as well as amenities for the community and new economic development spaces down at the bottom. You know, this is something that we've been working on for the past six years.

When I got in office in my first term, Pastor Hunter brought this project to me and he's been very diligent and very forthright as it relates to doing things on behalf of our community. And this is the product that we've come up with. And so I'm just really proud of how this looks and how it is going to cater to my community, especially as it relates to affordability.

In this council, we're talking often about affordability. This is 100% affordable. This is for and by the folks that live and are indigenous to the Lyondale community.

And so, again, I would ask for your support, favorable support of this. There's so many things that are going on in and around North Lyondale, and this will be one of the culminating and central hub pieces here in our community. So, again, I'm here for any questions if anybody has questions.

Thank you, Mr. Chair.

[Speaker 1] (58:06 - 58:09)
Congrats, Michael. A couple of questions from committee members. We'll start with Alderman Kaplan.

[Speaker 26] (58:10 - 58:34)
Yes, this is just a comment. Alderman Scott, I am blown away by this design. It is beyond spectacular.

This is Chicago proud. And it's even better that it's 100% affordable. I want to see more of these types of projects throughout Chicago, and I would love to see it more in my ward as well.

So, thank you. Thank you so much, Alderman Scott.

[Speaker 14] (58:37 - 58:42)
Alderman David Moore. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 29] (58:42 - 59:58)
I just wanted to add, I don't want this to get lost in this whole project. Yes, it's a good project. Yes, the design is great.

But what makes me excited about this project is that it's from the community and by the community, but it also incorporates, you know, the diversity in the city, especially in terms of the players that's involved of developing this project. When you're talking about starting with the church and Marvin Hara, which a lot of stuff starts at the church and the communities because the people are touching it. So for him to have that vision and then get a partnership with Eastlake Management, a company from the community.

And then when I hear about the diversity and even, you know, the zoning attorneys that's on here who are some great zoning attorneys, all of that really encompasses what we're talking about doing in our great city when we develop on the south and west side of Chicago. It helps everybody. So to my colleague, Alderman Michael Scott, this is a great project, one that I, again, as Alderman Kappelman just stated, should be mimicked, if you will, throughout this city.

[Speaker 1] (59:58 - 1:00:16)
So I move do pass on this item if we don't have any more questions. David, I don't see any other hands up. So Alderman David Moore makes the motion to move do pass on this item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections?

[Speaker 19] (1:00:16 - 1:00:17)
As amended.

[Speaker 1] (1:00:20 - 1:00:21)
As revised.

[Speaker 14] (1:00:22 - 1:00:23)
I'll get there.

[Speaker 1] (1:00:25 - 1:00:31)
Any objections? None. Okay.

So this item is passed as revised. Congrats, Michael.

[Speaker 6] (1:00:32 - 1:00:34)
Thank you, committee. Thank you so much, Mr. Chair.

[Speaker 1] (1:00:34 - 1:00:35)
Thank you, everybody.

[Speaker 14] (1:00:35 - 1:00:36)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:00:36 - 1:01:04)
All right, now we're back on the top of page 2. We are on document number 20895 in the 49th Ward. Ordinance was referred on December 15th of 2021.

Common address 7201 North Clark Street. And the change request from an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district and B32 community shopping district all to a B32 community shopping district.

[Speaker 14] (1:01:05 - 1:01:17)
Mark Kupiak. Mark. Alderman, can you hear me?

Clark.

[Speaker 16] (1:01:19 - 1:01:23)
Alderman Mark Kupiak, attorney for the applicant. Proceed.

[Speaker 1] (1:01:24 - 1:01:25)
You can proceed, Mark.

[Speaker 16] (1:01:26 - 1:02:47)
Yeah, I was just being promoted, so I was in the process here. Okay. So with that, for the record, my name is Mark Kupiak.

I'm an attorney with offices of 77 West Washington, represent the applicant. This involves a subject property, 7201 North Clark Street. Subject property is actually already improved with a gas station, a licensed gas station operating.

It's been operating there for years. More recently, the applicant attempted to get a building permit for an addition to the gas station Food Mart building. And during that process, it was discovered that the gas station sits on a split zoning lot.

Most of it is in fact B3, but a slice of the property along the eastern lot line is R4. So the purpose of the zoning change would be to split, correct, correct that split zoning designation so that the applicant could proceed with that building permit. I will note unrelated to this application, if the zoning has changed, the applicant still will need a special use to complete that project.

The applicant participated in the ward community process, and I do believe that Alderwoman Haddon had sent in a letter of support, although as I'm listening here, she may in fact be on the call.

[Speaker 1] (1:02:49 - 1:02:52)
Thank you, Mark. Alderwoman Haddon on the project.

[Speaker 16] (1:02:53 - 1:02:54)
Thank you, Chair.

[Speaker 13] (1:02:55 - 1:03:34)
Yep, exactly as Mr. Kupiak was saying, this is just a split zoning issue that we're trying to resolve. The gas station, under previous ownership, it's been there for a long time, so the current owners in making improvements ran into this issue, so we're just trying to bring them into compliance. We did go through our community zoning process to give community members in the area a chance to kind of weigh in and ask questions, but would appreciate my colleague's approval so that this business owner, gas station that's already kind of making these improvements can get their permit and move forward.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:03:35 - 1:03:44)
Any questions? No questions. Can I get a motion to move to pass for the same roll call that was used to determine form?

[Speaker 31] (1:03:44 - 1:03:46)
So moved by Alderman Cardona.

[Speaker 1] (1:03:46 - 1:04:35)
Alderman Cardona makes the motion. Any objections to this motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Hold on a second. It was Cardona. Yes, he recommended it.

Oh, okay, great. So he is part of the form. All right.

Thank you. All right. Now we're on page three.

Top of page three. Document number 20896T1, first ward. Ordinance was referred on December 15th of 2021.

Common address 1513 West Erie Street and the change request from an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district. Mark Kupiec, continue.

[Speaker 16] (1:04:36 - 1:05:51)
Alderman, thank you. For the record, my name is Mark Kupiec. I'm an attorney with offices at 77 West Washington.

I represent the applicant. This is for the property of 1513 West Erie Street. This particular property is already improved with a residential building, an older residential building.

The purpose of the zoning change would allow the applicant to add one additional dwelling unit in the basement first floor area of the building. Actually, visually, it looks like there's been an apartment there years ago established, but no permit record. The zoning change allowed him to get a permit for that apartment and use the building as a three flat, three dwelling units.

As Alderman LaSpada noted in his letter of support, actually this project is consistent with the city's policy goals with the additional dwelling unit ordinance, allows him to rehab this building and add the one dwelling unit. Unfortunately, this is not in an ADU pilot area, so in order to do the project, we need the zoning change and we are before you with that. I believe Alderman LaSpada did send his letter of support to the committee and we ask for your recommendation.

[Speaker 1] (1:05:52 - 1:06:12)
Thank you, Mark. We do have a letter of support from Alderman LaSpada. Questions on the application?

Oh, I'm sorry. David, I'm sorry. Daniel, are you going to speak on this?

I would love to briefly. Okay. I didn't see you on the call.

Oh, I'm sorry. Alderman LaSpada.

[Speaker 28] (1:06:13 - 1:07:24)
Thank you so much, chair. My thanks to the development team. My thanks to Mark for bringing this forward.

I will say, committee, this is not the first time that we had a zoning proposal at 1513. I think about a year ago it was proposed by another team to demolish the building entirely. But in our ward, I think in our city, we have a real preservation mindset.

And so based off of that, we felt it was right to hold out. And I'm really glad that we did because I really respect the way this new owner has come forward with a plan not only to preserve the existing property, but able to add density in a really reasonable way, in a way that really is in line with the pilot that we put forward that doesn't, as Mark said, extend across the street yet to the other side of Ashland. But it's a great proposal, really in line with the kind of development we want to see in the ward, and I humbly ask the committee's favorable consideration today.

[Speaker 1] (1:07:24 - 1:07:27)
Thank you, Alderman. Questions for the Alderman or the applicant?

[Speaker 16] (1:07:28 - 1:07:32)
Alderman Toney, could I add one item? Mark Kubiak here?

[Speaker 1] (1:07:32 - 1:07:33)
Yes, sir, Mark.

[Speaker 16] (1:07:33 - 1:07:44)
Just no procedurally. This was filed as a type 1 application with plans attached and we're proceeding as that type 1 with the same plans that were filed with no change.

[Speaker 1] (1:07:45 - 1:07:48)
Okay. So no further action from our committee since there's no changes?

[Speaker 16] (1:07:49 - 1:07:49)
Right.

[Speaker 1] (1:07:49 - 1:07:55)
Okay. All right. Can I get a motion to move due pass for the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 19] (1:07:56 - 1:07:57)
Move due pass. Moved by Alderman Raymond Lopez.

[Speaker 1] (1:07:57 - 1:08:04)
Alderman Raymond Lopez makes the motion. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, this item is passed.

[Speaker 14] (1:08:04 - 1:08:05)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (1:08:05 - 1:08:27)
Middle of page 3, document number 20898, in the 48th ward ordinance was referred on December 15th of 2021. The common address is 1123 West Copalpa Avenue and the change request be 13, neighborhood shopping district to a C13 neighborhood commercial District. We have attorney Tom Moore.

Mr. Moore.

[Speaker 5] (1:08:28 - 1:09:58)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Thomas S. Moore and this is a auto repair shop that has literally been there since 1975.

It was non-conforming in a B13. Unfortunately, during COVID, the principal owner was unable to or did not renew his license and the time passed for him to do so. And he cannot do the business he does, which is a body shop work in the B13.

So he's unable to get a new license. We've worked with the alderman and his staff throughout this process. And basically, and I think Alderman Osterman can speak to this, but the business has been in the ward for so long and serve so many of the ward residents that they did not want to make it close because of the inadvertent renewal during COVID.

And so the purpose of this zoning change is to allow this business that's been there since 1975 to continue serving the residents of the 48th ward.

[Speaker 1] (1:10:00 - 1:10:05)
Thank you, Mr. Moore. Alderman Osterman, would you want to comment on this application?

[Speaker 38] (1:10:06 - 1:10:32)
Yeah, thank you, Chairman and members of the committee. This business has been here for many, many years, as Mr. Moore has said. They had an issue with renewing their license.

And because it lapsed during COVID, for them to be conforming and continue as they have been since 1975, we need to do the zoning change. So I would ask for the member's support.

[Speaker 1] (1:10:32 - 1:11:10)
Questions for the alderman or the applicant? I don't see any hands. Can I get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was determined before?

So Chairman Mondal makes the motion. Any objections to her motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Bottom of page three, document number 20890 in the 40th ward. Ordinance was referred on December 15th of 2021. Common address 5435 North Walcott Avenue.

The change request M22 Light Industry District to C33 Commercial Manufacturing Employment District. And again, we have Mr. Moore on the application.

[Speaker 5] (1:11:11 - 1:12:21)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. This is an existing brewery in a manufacturing area. But it's not near any single family homes.

And it has a lot of open space and would be an ideal beer garden in the summer. And we had, we worked with the alderman and the community groups, and we had a community meeting. And there literally was no opposition to allowing a summer beer garden here in order to, those would not be allowed in an M2, but they would be allowed in a C3.

And the C33 that the extra three is because the community did not want multiple unit housing there, which would not be allowed. So as I said, we have the support of the community and you have a letter from the alderman and we request your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (1:12:21 - 1:12:25)
Thank you, Mr. Moore. I think Alderman Vasquez is on the call.

[Speaker 14] (1:12:25 - 1:12:40)
Would you like to make some comments, Andre? Okay. Well, we do have a letter of support from Alderman Vasquez on this project.

[Speaker 1] (1:12:40 - 1:13:32)
Any questions from committee members? Hearing none. Can I get a motion moved to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

So moved by Alderman Cardona. Alderman Cardona makes the motion. Any objections to his motion?

Hearing none. The item is passed. All right.

Top of page four, document number 20850 in the 47th ward ordinance was referred on October 14th of 2021. Common address 3914 through 30 North Lincoln Avenue. Also 3909 through 3917 North Damon Avenue.

The change request from a B12 neighborhood shopping district to B33 community shopping district, then to a residential business plan development. Mr. Tom Moore is on this application. Mr. Moore.

[Speaker 5] (1:13:33 - 1:15:00)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. This is a development that Alderman Martin and the community groups have worked on for a year and a half or so. It's gone through many changes.

It ended up in a 68 unit mixed use development. There'll be apartments above and commercial on the ground floor. It's a pedestrian street there.

It's less than a thousand feet from the L, so it will be a transit served location. We went through the plan commission process and have the approval of the plan commission. It's in the triangle between Lincoln and Damon, just South of Irving.

It ended up being a very handsome development. As I say, there were many changes that the community suggested that were incorporated into it. We have their support and we'd request your support as well.

I would ask that the plan commission record be incorporated into this record.

[Speaker 1] (1:15:04 - 1:15:08)
Incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

[Speaker 14] (1:15:08 - 1:15:09)
No move.

[Speaker 1] (1:15:09 - 1:15:52)
That was Alderman Roboius. Any objections? Hearing none, the records are incorporated and I think your testimony is complete, Mr. Moore. Yes. Okay. Now I need a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Again, Alderman Roboius makes that motion. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed as revised.

All right. Now I'm going to yield the chair to my vice chair, Alderman Roboius, as the next two items on page four are in the 44th board. Vice chair Roboius.

[Speaker 23] (1:15:52 - 1:16:25)
Thank you, chairman. The next item on the agenda is item number 20902 in the 44th ward. The ordinance was referred on December 15th, 2021.

Common address is 3120 to 3122 North Broadway Avenue. Change request is a B2-3 neighborhood mixed use district to a B3-3 community shopping district. We have with us attorney Andrew Scott to present on this matter.

[Speaker 39] (1:16:25 - 1:17:20)
Thank you very much, Mr. Vice chair, members of the committee. For the record, my name is Andrew Scott with the law offices of Taikama Gossett. This is a very simple rezoning.

The applicant Quincy Ventures is applying for the rezoning to get it from B2-3 to B3-3 so that it in turn can apply for a special use for a massage establishment on the vacant ground floor space of this building. No changes to the exterior of the building are proposed. This is solely being done to raise it up one zoning classification so that the tenant in the building can apply for the special use and available to answer any questions.

I should also mention we did meet twice with the neighbors association and I believe they were appreciative of our presentation and supportive of the proposal.

[Speaker 23] (1:17:22 - 1:17:28)
Thank you, attorney Scott. This is in the 44th ward. Chairman Tunney, would you like to speak on this matter before you?

[Speaker 1] (1:17:29 - 1:17:49)
Thank you, vice chair. As attorney Scott said, this is a use for a new business coming into the ward. No other changes to the building and such and has received community support and therefore my support.

So I'd ask a positive recommendation from the committee. Thank you.

[Speaker 31] (1:17:49 - 1:17:54)
It's passed, vice chair. Alderman Wagespack. There are no questions.

[Speaker 23] (1:17:54 - 1:18:42)
Alderman Wagespack makes the motion do pass for the same roll call used in permanent quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, this item is passed.

Thank you very much. Thank you. Moving on.

We have item number 20886 in the 44th ward. The original was referred on December 15, 2021. Common address is 3537 North Racine Avenue.

Change request. RT4, residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district to RM4.5 residential multi-unit district. Attorney Warren Silver is representing this item.

[Speaker 34] (1:18:43 - 1:19:57)
Good morning. I'm Warren Silver for the record of Silver Law Office PC. Our offices are at 1700 West Irving Park Road in Chicago.

We're representing the applicants Greg and Sarah Davey. The applicants bought a new construction condominium in September of 2020 and then subsequently discovered that their garage deck had not been properly permitted. Trying to fix that, working with a deck consultant, they found that apparently the building had been built some roughly 30 square feet larger than was permitted in the RT4.

The plans had shown that it was to be built up to the limit. There was an eight-tenths of a percent increase and so it doesn't conform to the RT4 limit. The purpose of this rezoning to RM4.5 would be to cause the property to become conforming so that they can move on with the steps necessary to legalize the garage deck.

[Speaker 23] (1:19:59 - 1:20:05)
Thank you, Attorney Silver. This is in the 44th ward. Chairman Tunney, would you like to speak on the matter?

[Speaker 1] (1:20:06 - 1:20:32)
Thank you, Vice Chair. I think Attorney Warren Silver obviously articulated the dilemma that these new homeowners encountered through no fault of their own and they met with immediate neighbors and have garnered their support so I'm supportive of this change and that will be visiting us again as we complete the project and revert the zoning back down.

[Speaker 23] (1:20:33 - 1:20:51)
Thank you, Chairman Tunney. There are no questions on the matter before us. If there are no questions, Alderman Cardona makes a motion do pass for the same roll call used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

[Speaker 1] (1:20:51 - 1:21:29)
Thank you. Thank you, everybody and thank you, Vice Chair. Now I'm on page five, top of page five, document number 20887 in the 39th ward.

Ordinance was deferred on December 15th of 2021. The common address is 5067 North Kimberley Avenue and the change request from an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RT3.5 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district. We have Attorney Fred Augustine, Augustine, Fred.

[Speaker 40] (1:21:29 - 1:22:28)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. For the record, my name is Fred Augustine with offices at 33 Northwest South Street. I'm here today on behalf of the applicant Julio Barahona.

The applicant is the owner of the property located at 5067 North Kimberley. Property is currently approved with the two-flat. We are seeking rezoning from the current RS3 district to an RT3.5 district. Mr. Chairman, we are keeping the existing two-flat. This property forms one zoning lot with the neighboring property at 5065 North Kimberley. The applicant would like to subdivide the zoning lot into essentially two separate zoning lots.

And in order to do that, we do need to rezone the subject property to an RT3.5. We have worked with Alderwoman Nugent and her office on this matter, as well as the community. All in our support, I believe you should have a letter on file.

[Speaker 14] (1:22:29 - 1:22:33)
So, I'm here to answer any questions the committee may have at this time.

[Speaker 1] (1:22:36 - 1:23:41)
Fred, we do have a letter of support from Alderman Nugent and I don't see her on the call. Anyways, we do have a letter of support and any questions for the applicant? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

Alderman Wagesbeck makes the motion. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Thank you, Fred. Okay, middle of page five, document number 20899-T1. In the 37th ward, ordinance was referred on December 15th of 2021.

Common address is 856 North Harding Avenue, also 3935-3945 West Iowa Street. And the change request RS3 residential single unit detached house district to B23 neighborhood mixed use district. We have Jimena Castro on this one.

Good morning.

[Speaker 25] (1:23:42 - 1:24:25)
Good morning. Happy New Year. My name is Jimena Castro.

I'm a zoning attorney at Acosta-Escar and I have three matters before you all today. The first matter, as you mentioned, Chairman, is 856 North Harding. The property is zoned RS3 and we filed a zoning application to rezone to a B23.

It is a TOD property as well to the Chicago bus and the property is improved with a two-story residential building that includes four units. We filed the application to allow two more units in the building for a total of six units. And we also met with Alderman Emma Mitz and we provided a letter of support to your committee as well.

[Speaker 1] (1:24:26 - 1:24:40)
Jimena, we do have a letter of support from Alderwoman Mitz. Any questions on this application? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that we form?

[Speaker 3] (1:24:40 - 1:24:41)
Move to pass.

[Speaker 1] (1:24:41 - 1:25:17)
Alderman Wagesback makes the motion. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, this item is passed.

Now we're on the bottom of page five, document number 20908 in the 30th ward. Ordinance was referred on December 15th of 2021. Common address 3036 North Dablin Court.

Change request from an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district. Jimena Castro again.

[Speaker 25] (1:25:18 - 1:26:00)
Hello. So yes, this is the second property before you today. As you mentioned, 3036 Dablin Court.

The property is zoned RS3 and we filed a zoning application to rezone the property to an RT4. The property is improved with a three-story residential building that includes three units and one legal non-conforming unit. And the zoning application is attempting to legalize that existing legal non-conforming unit to allow for four total units.

We met with Alderman Riboras, who I know is also on the call. And if he would like to say something, I would appreciate it, but I know that he supports the case.

[Speaker 14] (1:26:02 - 1:26:19)
Support from Alderman Riboras, but I know he's on the call. Ariel, would you like to speak on it? Well, maybe he stepped off for a minute, but we do have a letter of support.

Ariel, I think you're muted.

[Speaker 23] (1:26:19 - 1:26:21)
I am here. I was muted. I apologize.

[Speaker 1] (1:26:21 - 1:26:23)
Okay, let's talk on the Dablin Court.

[Speaker 23] (1:26:24 - 1:26:45)
Yeah, the owner bought this as a four-unit building and we later found out that it was a non-conforming use. So, we're just helping them bring it to a passing residential building, a four-unit building. We just want to fix this for them.

So, I'm asking for your favorable support on the matter before you.

[Speaker 1] (1:26:45 - 1:26:57)
Thank you, Vice Chair. Do I have any questions for the applicant or the Alderman? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 30] (1:26:57 - 1:26:59)
Moved to pass, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:26:59 - 1:27:45)
Alderman Wagesvek makes that motion. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

All right, we are on the top of page six. Let me read into the record. Document number 20907-T1 in the 25th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on December 15th of 2021. Common address is 2124 South Ashland Avenue, also 1600-1610 West 21st Place. The change request from V-3-2 Community Shopping District to V-2-3 Neighborhood Mixed Use District.

Jimena Castro.

[Speaker 25] (1:27:46 - 1:28:29)
Hi, hello again. So, as you mentioned, the property is located at 2124 South Ashland, currently zoned V-3-2. We filed a zoning application to rezone it to a V-2-3.

It is a TOD-located property to the Ashland bus. It is currently improved with a two-story office building. And the zoning application, as you mentioned, Chairman, is attempting to convert the building to residential use that will include two live-work units on the ground floor that will also be ADA units, and two dwelling units on the second floor.

We met with the Aldermen's zoning board as well, and I believe the Alderman is also on the call as well.

[Speaker 14] (1:28:30 - 1:28:59)
So, let's hear from Alderman Citro Lopez on this application, please. Byron, are you on the call? Citro Lopez, we do not have a letter of support at this time.

Jimena, did you get a letter of support from the Alderman?

[Speaker 25] (1:29:01 - 1:29:07)
My understanding was that the Alderman was going to speak on this matter. We can certainly, you know...

[Speaker 1] (1:29:07 - 1:29:19)
Well, I'll hold it if I don't hear from him. So, you want to just stay tuned, and he's probably off doing something else. But I know he was on the call earlier.

So, we got to hear from him. So, we'll put this on hold. Okay.

Thank you.

[Speaker 42] (1:29:19 - 1:29:20)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:29:20 - 1:29:57)
All right. Next, we're on the middle of page six, document number 20708, in the 27th ward. Ordinance was referred on May 26th of 2021.

This common address is 1223 through 1245 West Fulton. And the change request from the C33 Commercial Manufacturing and Employment District and M23 Light Industry District to a DX7, Downtown Mixed-Use District, and then to Residential Business Plan Development. And we have Rich Clowder on the call.

Rich, in the 27th ward.

[Speaker 24] (1:29:58 - 1:30:24)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Rich Clowder with the law firm of DLA Piper. I represent the applicant in this matter, 1245 West Fulton, LLC, which is a Sterling Bay controlled entity.

As a preliminary matter, this application was considered and recommended for approval at the December 16th, 2021 Plan Commission hearing. And we would request that the transcript from that hearing be incorporated into the record here today.

[Speaker 1] (1:30:30 - 1:30:36)
Alderman Raboyas moves to incorporate the records from the Plan Commission by the same roll call that was used to determine form.

[Speaker 33] (1:30:37 - 1:30:37)
So moved.

[Speaker 1] (1:30:38 - 1:30:44)
Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the records are incorporated. Continue, Rich.

[Speaker 24] (1:30:44 - 1:32:36)
Thank you. Very briefly, the subject property is approximately 38,693 square feet and is located at 1223 through 1245 West Fulton in the Fulton Market District. The subject property, as you mentioned, is zoned C33 and M23.

The request in this matter is to rezone the property to an underlying DX7 zoning prior to establishing a residential plan development. The subject property will be improved with an approximately 314 foot tall residential building consisting of 350 units, including 70 on-site affordable units with the objective of including an additional 35 affordable units on-site or off-site if sufficient city assistance can be obtained in accordance with the Fulton Market Innovation District enhanced affordability goals. The overall FAR for the project will be 11.5, resulting in a nearly $1.8 million bonus payment to the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund. You can see the building rendered on your screen. The development will generate in excess of 300 construction jobs and will meet the city's requirements of 26.6% MBE-WBE participation. As you know, every project in the 27th Ward receives robust community input.

We had several community meetings over the course of several months with local stakeholders, including community-wide meetings as well as meetings with the Department of Planning and Development. The ultimate building design was changed, resulting in additional open space landscaping and an enhanced tower design, as well as important changes to promote and enhance the pedestrian experience along Fulton Street. Thanks to Alderman Burnett and DPD for their review of this project and for their favorable feedback.

We would like to respect that this body recommend approval of this project to the full City Council. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:32:38 - 1:32:46)
All right. Thank you, Rich. I know this went through Plan Commission.

Alderman Burnett, are you on the call?

[Speaker 11] (1:32:47 - 1:32:49)
Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 10] (1:32:51 - 1:34:40)
Walter, can you put up the volume, please? Can you hear me now? Yes, sir.

Okay. So I concur with everything that the Councilor said. Although I'm starting to feel like a stepchild to Lincoln Yards with Sturgeon Bay.

You know, it's like they do everything in Lincoln Yards. What about the Fulton Market now? You know, we just get this.

We started this thing off and now we get the peanuts. We get one building, they get 10 over there. But anyway, as the Councilor said, they did meet with the three community groups over in the area.

We did have a community meeting. If I'm not mistaken, they went through the Planning Department New Design Organization, and they went through several renditions with the Planning Department of changing the design. I haven't got any complaints from the community.

The 75 affordable housing that they're going to do in this development is the 20%. The other 35 that they're going to try and do with city assistance would be 30%. So this would be a large amount of affordable housing in one of the hottest communities in the city of Chicago.

It's close to transportation, has a lot of green space. Them and planning and all of the architects working together came up with a beautiful project. The developer committed to having a contractor to do a joint venture with a minority contractor, which helped to cover the 30% in the WBE that's required with this development.

I ask for this body's support of this project. I support it. Thank you very much.

[Speaker 14] (1:34:43 - 1:34:44)
Thank you all, Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (1:34:46 - 1:34:50)
Any questions for the Alderman or the presenter?

[Speaker 10] (1:34:51 - 1:36:48)
Oh, Mr. Chairman, I would be remiss, and I think this is one of the things that the Councilor didn't include in this presentation, is the amount of neighborhood opportunity funds that's going to, that's coming from this development. Can you tell us how much that is, if I may ask? Sure, Alderman, it's $1.8 million. And that $1.8 million, so everyone can know, because I know folks think food market is just about building, but food market has an impact on the whole city of Chicago. That $1.8 million is going into the neighborhood opportunity fund. That money that goes into that neighborhood opportunity fund actually goes to the Invest Southwest, on the west and the south side, to help enhance all those developments that's happening around the city.

Not only that, this development also will enhance the TIF in this area. As folks may or may not know, this is one of the healthiest TIFs in the city of Chicago. And if you all recall, at every budget time, when we are in a hole with our budget, we feed off of the TIFs in this area to help balance the budget.

So the food market area and the developments that happens over here really help the whole city of Chicago. Not only do it help the south and the west side, but it also help us with our tax situation, with our budgets, so we don't be a burden on other people across the city and raising their taxes. So this area is not only an economic engine for the city, we're bringing more people to the city and more business and more visitors, but it's also a lifesaver for the city in a lot of different ways.

So I just wanted to mention that. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:36:50 - 1:37:16)
Thank you, Alderman. And I can't tell you how many times we're working in Fulton Market with your leadership. And as you say, what an economic impact it has on the entire city.

So congratulations on this item. Any questions, comments from committee members? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 37] (1:37:16 - 1:37:17)
Moved to pass, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:37:18 - 1:38:16)
Alderman Wageson. Wageson makes the motion. Any objections to his motion?

Hearing none, this item is passed as revised. All right. We're going to just go right back to the previous item because we have made contact with Alderman Sitio Lopez.

I'll read it, just the address and the item back in and ask for a motion to move to pass. That item is, again, top of page six, 20907 T1, 25th Ward. The ordinance was referred on December 15th, 2021 and the common address 2124 South Ashland Avenue, also 1600 210 West 21st Place.

As I said, we have a letter of support from Alderman Sitio Lopez. Do we have any questions on this item we just heard? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 42] (1:38:16 - 1:38:17)
So moved.

[Speaker 1] (1:38:18 - 1:38:24)
Alderman Ravoyos makes the motion. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, this item is passed.

[Speaker 25] (1:38:24 - 1:38:26)
Thank you, everyone. I appreciate it.

[Speaker 1] (1:38:26 - 1:38:56)
All right. Thank you. All right.

Top of page seven. Document number 20889 T1, 30th Ward. Ordinance was referred on December 15th of 2021.

Common address is 3714 North Cicero Avenue. Change request from a B31 Community Shopping District to a B23 Neighborhood Mixed Use District. Dan Lauer is on the call in the 30th Ward.

Dan? Good morning, Chairman.

[Speaker 37] (1:38:56 - 1:39:55)
Tony, 3714 North Cicero, application 20889 T1. I represent G7 Investments, LLC Series D. It's a pretty big site, 32 by 125, 4,000 square feet.

The proposal is to change from B31 to B23 Neighborhood Mixed Use District for six large units, each large two bedrooms above a retail space. It will replace a vacant one-story motorcycle repair shop. We met with Vice Chairman Ravoyos and his staff, along with the applicant.

We had a virtual community meeting in August of last year, pretty well attended. Then Vice Chairman Ravoyos, it's his habit, his policy to take feedback, which he did throughout the fall of 2021, and we're not aware of any objections.

[Speaker 14] (1:39:56 - 1:40:02)
We'd like to say thanks to Vice Chairman Ariel Ravoyos and his staff for their support.

[Speaker 1] (1:40:06 - 1:40:11)
Thank you, Dan. Alderman Ravoyos on this item?

[Speaker 23] (1:40:11 - 1:40:36)
Thank you, Chairman. Yeah, we did have a community meeting on this matter before you, B3-1 to a B2-3 of a four-story building with retail space and six residential dwelling units. We had a virtual meeting and there were no objections, so I move that we're asking for a favorable vote on the matter before you.

[Speaker 1] (1:40:37 - 1:40:47)
Thank you, Alderman. Any questions for the Alderman or the applicant? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 31] (1:40:47 - 1:40:48)
It's passed, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:40:49 - 1:41:22)
Alderman Waguespack. Alderman Waguespack again makes that motion. Any objections to his motion?

Hearing none, this item is passed. All right, middle of page seven, document number 20893-T1 in the 29th Ward. Ordinance was referred on December 15th of 2021.

Common address is 1256 North Waller Avenue. Change request from an RS-3 residential single unit detached house district to a C-1-2 neighborhood commercial district. Dean Maragos.

[Speaker 41] (1:41:32 - 1:42:08)
Mr. Chairman, can you hear me? Yes, we can, Dean. Thank you very much.

I'm Dean T. Maragos of the law firm of Maragos and Maragos in Chicago, representing the applicant and the church. With me is Pastor Ira Acree and his executive assistant, Erica Saffold.

This is a type one change and there have been no changes since the filing. And we have worked with the Alderman who is on the phone right now. I just spoke with Alderman Taliaferro and we've had no objections from the community.

And Alderman, can you comment on this for me?

[Speaker 1] (1:42:09 - 1:42:11)
Dean, I'll ask the Alderman to speak.

[Speaker 41] (1:42:11 - 1:42:16)
I apologize, Tom. I apologize. I just had him on my cell phone and I apologize.

[Speaker 1] (1:42:16 - 1:42:23)
He just popped into our meeting. So Alderman Taliaferro, would you like to speak on this item on Waller, please?

[Speaker 6] (1:42:24 - 1:43:06)
Thank you, Chairman and members of the committee. Greater St. John Bible Church and Pastor Acree have been staples on the west side of Chicago. Particularly their work, not only from a pastoral basis in the church that serves the community, but also in community service.

Having this culinary kitchen in the church will give the church a better opportunity to serve the community and serve its membership through serving those that are in need of resources, as well as teaching and training those that are in the church. So I ask for your favorable consideration in this matter. And I want to thank you for your time, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:43:07 - 1:43:17)
Thank you, Chris. Any questions for the Alderman or the applicant? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that we used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 31] (1:43:18 - 1:43:19)
So moved by Alderman Cardona.

[Speaker 1] (1:43:20 - 1:43:28)
Alderman Cardona makes the motion. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, this item is passed.

Thanks, everybody.

[Speaker 41] (1:43:29 - 1:43:31)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee.

[Speaker 1] (1:43:31 - 1:43:53)
Thank you, Dean. Bottom of page seven, document number 20904, 24th Ward. Ordinance was referred on December 15th of 2021.

Common address is 1501 South Central Park Avenue. The change request from an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to a B32 community shopping district.

[Speaker 2] (1:43:54 - 1:44:38)
Nick Fitikas. Morning, Chairman. For the record, Nick Fitikas from the Law Offices of Sam Bates.

I'm here on behalf of the applicant and property owner. We are proposing to amend the zoning to reestablish a retail use on the first floor of the existing mixed-use building. The current RT4 zoning, that zoning district allowed the retail use to lapse during COVID while the retail space was vacant.

So there are no other changes proposed to the physical structure of the building. We did work with the Alderman's office, and I believe Scott's office had sent a letter of support earlier this morning to staff, and we'd be happy to answer any questions you or the committee members might have about the project.

[Speaker 1] (1:44:39 - 1:45:29)
Nick, we do have a letter of support from Alderman Scott. Any questions by committee members? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move to pass for the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

So moved, Alderman Austin. Alderman, Alderman Kerry Austin makes the motion. Any objections to her motion?

Hearing none, the item is passed. Top of page eight, document number 20903-T1, in the sixth ward. Ordinance was referred on December 15th of 2021.

Common address is 6901 South Perry Avenue. And the change request, C12, Neighborhood Commercial District, and RS3, Residential Single Unit Detached House District, all to a C12, Neighborhood Commercial District. Nick Fatikas.

[Speaker 2] (1:45:30 - 1:46:20)
And again, Chairman Nick Fatikas, for the record, I'm here on behalf of the applicant Rainier Perry LLC. The applicant is actually purchasing the subject property from the city of Chicago. The plan is to redevelop, or I'm sorry, to develop the currently vacant lot with the new fast food restaurant and Dunkin' Donuts restaurant with the drive-through lane.

The drive-through lane will require a special use provided the zoning change is allowed. In this case, we're dealing with a split zoning district where the zoning is C1-2 and RS-3. We're seeking to propose a uniform C1-2 zoning district to support the project.

We have, in this case, worked with Alderman Sawyer. I believe a letter of support was already provided. And I believe I saw the Alderman on the call earlier.

So I would defer back to you for any questions about the program.

[Speaker 1] (1:46:21 - 1:46:27)
Thank you, Nick. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Sawyer. Rod, are you on the call still?

[Speaker 5] (1:46:30 - 1:46:31)
Yes, I am, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:46:32 - 1:46:32)
Okay.

[Speaker 5] (1:46:33 - 1:46:33)
And thank you.

[Speaker 6] (1:46:34 - 1:46:48)
Just very briefly, we've been working with the applicant for some time now, both in the acquisition and making sure they get the required amendments necessary to build this Dunkin' Donuts. And we fully support the project. And we ask for your favorable consideration.

[Speaker 1] (1:46:48 - 1:47:44)
Thank you, Alderman. Any questions for the Alderman or the applicant? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

Moved by Mr. Chairman, Alderman Dowell. Alderman Dowell makes the motion. Any objections to her motion?

Hearing none, this item is passed. All right. Thank you.

And now we're in the middle of page eight, document number 20906. In the second ward, ordinance was referred on December 15th of 2021. Common address is 1438 West Augusta Boulevard.

And the change request from an RS3 residential single unit detached house district and RM6 residential multi-unit district, all to an RM4.5 residential multi-unit district. And we also have Nick Petikas on this item. Nick?

[Speaker 2] (1:47:44 - 1:48:30)
Yes, thank you again for the record. Nick Petikas from the Law Offices of Sam Banks. Chairman, in this case, we have a vacant lot that contains approximately 41,000, I'm sorry, 4,157 square feet of total lot area.

And it's currently vacant and split zoned RS3 and RM6. And the property owner is proposing to develop the property with a new four-story three-unit residential building in order to establish a consistent underlining zoning district. We're seeking a zoning change to a consistent or uniform RM4.5. We have worked with Alderman Hopkins' office as well as the Eckerd Park Community Council. And I believe letters of support for this matter as well as the next matter were provided to staff earlier today.

[Speaker 1] (1:48:33 - 1:49:30)
All right, we do have a letter of support from Alderman Hopkins. Questions for the attorney? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

Alderman Cardona makes the motion. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, this item is passed.

Now we're on the bottom of page eight, also in the second ward, document number 20905. Ordinance was referred on December 15th of 2021. This common address is also on Augusta, but it's 1458 West Augusta.

Change request, RS3, residential single unit detached house district and RM6, residential multi-unit district, all again to an RM4.5 residential multi-unit district. Nick, Fatikas on the item.

[Speaker 2] (1:49:31 - 1:50:13)
Again, Nick Fatikas for the record. Chairman, I'm here on behalf of the same applicant and property owner as the last matter. The subject property at 1458 West Augusta is currently vacant and contains 3,897 square feet of total lot area.

The applicant is proposing a very similar building design, a four-story three-unit residential building at the subject property. In order to permit the project, we're seeking a zoning change to establish a uniform RM4.5 zoning district. Again, we have worked with Alderman Hopkins's office, as well as the Eckerd Park Community Council.

And as I mentioned, I believe a letter of support should already be on file with staff.

[Speaker 1] (1:50:18 - 1:50:34)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Hopkins on this application also. Questions from committee members? I have no hands up.

Can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 14] (1:50:35 - 1:50:38)
So moved by Alderman Cardona.

[Speaker 1] (1:50:38 - 1:51:16)
Alderman Cardona makes the motion. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, this item is passed.

Now we're staying in the second ward, top of page nine, document number 20888, second ward, ordinance was referred December 15th of 2021. Common address is 1714 West Beach Avenue. The change request from an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to an RM4.5 residential multi-unit district. And we have Nick Fitikas again.

[Speaker 2] (1:51:17 - 1:52:12)
Thank you, Chairman. Again, Nick Fitikas for the record. I'm here on behalf of the applicant and property owners, Corey Faulkner and Melissa Sweezy.

They currently and actually have lived at the subject property, which is developed with the single family home since about 2013. The zoning lot is actually substandard. It measures 24 feet wide by only a hundred feet deep.

And the owners are looking to permit a partial third floor and rear addition to the property in order to permit the additional floor area, as well as building height. They're seeking a zoning change to an RM4.5 district. The applicants again, have been in the neighborhood for quite some time and met with a number of their immediate neighbors.

And I believe seven or eight letters of support were provided to Alderman Hopkins' office. And based on that outreach, I believe the alderman has also provided a letter of support for the requested zoning change.

[Speaker 1] (1:52:13 - 1:52:27)
Nick, we have received the letter of support from Alderman Hopkins. Do we have any questions, comments from committee members? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that we used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 14] (1:52:28 - 1:52:30)
So moved by Alderman Cardona.

[Speaker 1] (1:52:30 - 1:53:33)
Alderman Cardona again makes that motion. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, this item is passed.

And we're going to read into the record, but I want to make sure, Alderman Hopkins, are you on the call? I am Mr. Chairman. Okay.

Let me read this in the middle of page nine. It's document number 20628T1 in the second ward. Ordinance was referred on February 24th of 2021.

The common address is 1628 through 1630 North Wells. The change requests from a B11 neighborhood shopping district to a B35 community shopping district. And we have Nick Batikas.

For the benefit of our committee members, there was public comment period on this item from Americana Towers, I believe was the condominium that is nearby. And staff, do we have other electronic?

[Speaker 13] (1:53:34 - 1:53:38)
We did receive electronic indication from another gentleman.

[Speaker 1] (1:53:39 - 1:53:42)
Okay. So we have a couple of objections on the record.

[Speaker 2] (1:53:43 - 1:59:57)
Nick, would you present the application, please? Yes, sir. Again, for the record, Nick Batikas from the Law Offices of Sam Banks.

I'm here on behalf of the applicant 1628 North Wells LLC. The applicant owns the subject property at 1628 through 30 North Wall Street. Mr. Chairman, before I speak to the specifics of the proposal and the details of the surrounding area, I'd like to advise the committee on the procedural history of this application. As you can see from the agenda, the matter was initially introduced at city council on February 24th of 2021. The matter was deferred from public hearing by the alderman in March of 2021 so that additional conversations could be had regarding the proposal. On July 16th of 2021, my office filed a substitute ordinance and substitute type one narrative correcting the description of the existing zoning designation for the subject property.

Revised notice letters were sent to property owners within 250 feet of the subject property and I believe committee staff republished the correct change request. Still, the matter was deferred from consideration by the committee in August and September of 2021. Given that more than six months had lapsed since our initial filing and introduction, the zoning change application was deemed denied pursuant to section 17130309 of the ordinance.

At that point, the applicant retained litigation counsel and filed a lawsuit in the circuit court of Cook County challenging the denial. Now, our matter was recalled and deferred again in December of 2021 and as you know, it's being recalled for hearing today and we believe that the applicant or the application has already been denied by process of the ordinance. Still, we intend to preserve our rights and of course participate in today's hearing with the committee.

So, with that background in mind and now with respect to the proposal, the subject property consists of an irregularly shaped zoning lot that contains 8737 square feet of total lot area. It's currently improved with a three-story mixed-use building at the front of the property and a detached two-story coach house located at the rear. The applicant is proposing to take down the existing buildings and develop the property with a new seven-story mixed-use building that will contain retail space of grade and a total of 48 residential units above.

The subject property is a transit serve location based on its proximity to the Cedric CTA station and no off-site parking will be provided. In order to permit the project, the applicant is requesting a zoning change from the current split zone RM5 and B1-1 zoning district to a uniform B3-5 zoning district. It's important to note that the subject property is the only split zone zoning lot on the west side of this segment of north wall street.

The split zoning designation imposes inconsistent fault and use restrictions on the subject lot with respect to floor area, the minimum lot area requirements, setbacks, and even use of the building's first floor. For example, the RM5 zoning allows a 2.0 FAR and a 400 square foot minimum, I'm sorry, 400 square foot minimum lot area ratio to establish residential density. However, B1-1 zoning allows for a 1.2 FAR and requires 2,500 square feet of lot area for residential density. Similarly, the RM5 zoning district does not allow for the establishment of retail uses within the district. However, B1-1 zoning allows retail uses and actually restricts residential uses to floors two and above. Per the ordinance, where there's a conflict between the bulk and the density standards in a split zoning district, the permitted or allowed uses are controlled by the more restrictive zoning classification.

So in this case, the split zoning district restricts the development rights of the subject property to those of essentially a residential three flat while still requiring special use approval for the ground floor, which is absolutely inconsistent with the neighboring zoning districts and land uses. To that point, 1636 through 40 North Wells, which is the property located immediately north of the subject property, is located in a B3-5 zoning district. That property is improved with Americana Towers, a 32-story mixed-use multi-unit condominium building.

205 West Eugenie, the next property to the north, is located in a C1-5 zoning district. That property is improved with a three and four-story mixed-use building along Wells and residential townhomes at the rear. Now to the south of our site is 200 through 222 West North Avenue, which is commonly known as Piper's Alley.

That property, again, is immediately adjacent to the subject property to the south. That residential plan development has a base FAR of 5.5 and a density allowance for 480 residential units. The general trend of dash five zoning extends along the south side of North Avenue and along both sides of Wells Street, south of North Avenue, where again, B3-5 zoning is the predominant base zoning district for these properties.

We respectfully ask the committee to extend the predominant base zoning district in the immediate area to include the subject property, which again, today, is the only split-zoned low-density lot in that same area. And with that, we'd be happy to answer any questions you might have about the project. I'd also point out for the record that the slide presentation was presented.

Our architect is on the call and can speak to that specifically, not only the proposed building plan, but we included elevations that show the context of our building with the neighboring structures along the west side of Wells Street. And Chairman, again, we'd be happy to answer any questions you or the committee members might have about the project.

[Speaker 1] (2:00:01 - 2:00:06)
Nick, do we have substitutes to pass before we get to the meat of the...

[Speaker 2] (2:00:06 - 2:00:24)
Yeah. So again, as I stated in my summary, we did file a substitute ordinance back on July 16th of 2021 because the case had not been called to hearing by the committee. It had been deferred.

I believe that action still needs to occur.

[Speaker 1] (2:00:25 - 2:00:31)
So we need to move the substantive narrative and plans for the type one application, correct?

[Speaker 2] (2:00:31 - 2:00:34)
And the substitute ordinance and narrative.

[Speaker 1] (2:00:35 - 2:02:06)
We have to have two separate motions. So on the motion to accept the substantive narrative plan for the type one application, the same roll call that was used to determine form, who's making that motion? I'll make that motion.

Okay. Cardona makes the motion to accept the substantive narrative plans for the type one application. Any objections to that?

None. Okay. So the substantive narrative plans have been accepted, but we also need a motion.

Correct me if I'm wrong. We're going to need a motion to accept the substitute on the ordinance by the same roll call that was used to determine form. So that's the second half of these procedural mechanisms.

So can I get a motion to move the substitute on the ordinance by the same roll call that was used to determine form? Who is that? Alderman Raboyas makes the motion to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine form.

Any objections to that? Okay. So now we have the type one change and the ordinance change.

So now we can open it up for questions and or comments. Alderman Hopkins, would you like to start or finish or both?

[Speaker 7] (2:02:06 - 2:02:09)
Yeah, I'll reserve the right to close Mr. Chairman. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:02:10 - 2:02:28)
So I think I have a couple of questions. I think, first of all, I know we heard from the high rise to the north. I think Concord Lane, if I'm not mistaken, is a, what type of community is that?

Is that a gated townhouse community?

[Speaker 2] (2:02:29 - 2:02:38)
Yes, it is. And that's immediately, that's immediately south of the subject property, a three-story townhome with a private drive. Yes.

Correct.

[Speaker 1] (2:02:39 - 2:03:00)
And how does the coach house interact with the townhouses? Well, how is that? I mean, I don't know my, I know the entrance because it's gated and I think I might've been in there once in my lifetime, but I don't recall how this coach house interacts or doesn't interact with this townhouse community.

[Speaker 2] (2:03:01 - 2:03:52)
So the coach house is effectively behind or north of the townhome community. Access currently comes from a driveway off of Wall Street. That is immediately north of the principal building.

If you go back, if you can go back to the survey, the property, when I described it as being irregularly shaped, it's 50 feet wide at the front and it narrows at the rear. So if you're looking at the survey chairman, the two-story building, that's really the focus of the left half that area. Correct.

Is, is the, the coach house and then the shaded area directly south of that or below it. So if you were to go in that area, correct, is the townhome development. So there's currently, again, they're separate, but adjacent buildings.

Right.

[Speaker 1] (2:03:53 - 2:04:02)
But we are, if this ordinance passed, we are doing the entire lot to a B3-5.

[Speaker 2] (2:04:02 - 2:04:17)
Correct. I'm sorry, chairman, because right now the front half of the lot is zoned B1-1 and the rear of the lot, the narrower section of the lot is zoned RM-5. So it's a split district.

[Speaker 1] (2:04:19 - 2:04:24)
But why in my narrative do I only have B1-1 for the entire application?

[Speaker 2] (2:04:24 - 2:04:33)
Well, that, that was the, that was the correction made in July when we filed the substitute ordinance and sent out the revised notices.

[Speaker 1] (2:04:35 - 2:04:36)
Staff, are you okay with that?

[Speaker 14] (2:04:37 - 2:04:37)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:04:37 - 2:04:53)
All right. But, you know, from a practical point of view, and I know, I don't know if the developer has showed, how does that, what does the rear look like under the proposed development, especially where that coach house is?

[Speaker 2] (2:04:54 - 2:05:24)
So the coach house would effectively be replaced with open green space. Our plan, as you see right there on the screen, the seven-story building is oriented toward the east half of the lot and that open, we're proposing open space, green space, almost like an open yard at the rear. What functions is the rear of our lot?

So those townhomes looking back to the north would look on to open space.

[Speaker 14] (2:05:27 - 2:05:27)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (2:05:29 - 2:05:40)
Okay. All right. Any other committee members with their hands up or questions before we hear from Alderman Hopkins?

I don't see hands up. So Brian.

[Speaker 7] (2:05:41 - 2:09:11)
Yeah. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am in opposition to this proposal and I would ask my colleagues to vote no and the appropriate roll call at the appropriate time.

And I'll state my reasons, primarily three reasons, site suitability, neighborhood characteristics, and community opposition. With regard to site suitability, as council for the applicant did describe this as an irregularly shaped lot, which is not in and of itself necessarily a barrier to comprehensive redevelopment. However, in this case, there is no alley access for this lot.

And there currently does exist an off-street footprint, which would be removed by the proposed structure. So therefore, you're going from nine parking spaces off street down to zero. You also are sacrificing any ability to have off-street ingress and egress, off-street loading, and more importantly, trash collection.

Without an alley, there is simply no mechanism for off-street waste collection, which is obviously a problem that is not addressed in the proposal. The current structure has a height of 30 feet. The proposed structure goes up to 76 feet.

Current unit count is five. The proposed redevelopment takes that up to 48. Parking, again, nine down to zero, a three-story structure on up to a seven-story structure.

So this particular site is completely unsuitable to the proposed redevelopment. In addition to that, the neighborhood characteristic, as council did point out, the suggestion is to rezone this to a B35, and the parcel immediately to the north is in fact a B35. So I can see that point.

However, if you look at the dimensions of the footprint, the parcel to the north is approximately seven times the size of the footprint as the proposed redevelopment site, which is currently B11. The predominant zoning district on this particular block of Wells, if you look at both the east side and the west side of Wells Street, is in fact B13, not B35. So this would be out of character with the predominant zoning designation for the entire 1600 block of North Wells.

Community opposition, as was clearly stated, the neighbors have been in opposition to any redevelopment proposal for this site. We did conduct a community meeting without the specifics of this proposal in front of us, but we conducted a community meeting for the general topic of potential rezoning for this site. And after reviewing all the challenges presented and outlined, it was determined that no rezoning should be considered for this site.

It can be redeveloped within the parameters of the existing zoning, despite the fact that there is a mixed designation there. That is not an insurmountable problem to a development proposal that would be in greater conformity with the neighborhood characteristics, but this is not that. So I have to remain in firm opposition to this proposal, and I would ask my colleagues to vote no on a motion to do pass.

[Speaker 1] (2:09:17 - 2:09:55)
Okay, Alderman, before, and I'm going to ask for a roll call on this, but I have one other comment. I actually have used to live a couple blocks away on LaSalle years ago. I always felt that this Americana Towers was out of character, but obviously it's been built 50 or 60 years ago.

Would you be, would I be correct saying that north of North Avenue, on both sides of Wells, that you don't have anything like this building that Americana Towers represents?

[Speaker 7] (2:09:56 - 2:09:57)
That would be accurate.

[Speaker 1] (2:09:59 - 2:10:43)
Now, south of North is another issue. You know, that's actually, if I'm not mistaken, in Walters, some of that's in Walters. So yeah, even though the building has been there for, I'm sure, 50 to 60 years, it is, in my opinion, uncharacteristic for Wells on this portion from North Avenue north.

And most of the, most of the high rises of this sort are on LaSalle or Clark, north of North Avenue. That would be accurate. All right.

All right. So let me, oh, I'm sorry. Tony Beal, Anthony Beal.

[Speaker 35] (2:10:44 - 2:10:47)
Yeah, Mr. Chairman, I just want a motion do not pass on this item.

[Speaker 1] (2:10:49 - 2:11:03)
All right. So we, we have a motion do not pass by Alderman Beal. Is there any objection to that motion?

[Speaker 7] (2:11:05 - 2:11:21)
Yeah, Mr. Chairman, I'm, I'm fine with either way. If we have a do not pass motion, I would ask my colleagues to support the motion. If we put a do pass motion, I would ask my colleagues to vote no.

I mean, that's semantics. Either way, it gets us to the same point. So I have no preference with...

[Speaker 1] (2:11:21 - 2:11:29)
Well, the motion's on the floor by Alderman Beal to do not pass. Any objections to his motion?

[Speaker 10] (2:11:30 - 2:11:59)
Mr. Chairman, can I ask one question? Alderman Burnett. Yeah, thank you.

So, so you said that the, with the new development, if it was going to be built, it would have how many units? I think it's 48. 48.

So would it have to have 20% affordable also? I believe so. All right.

[Speaker 1] (2:12:00 - 2:12:26)
Thank you. All right. Any other questions?

So again, Alderman Beal has a motion on the floor, move do not pass. Any objections to that motion? Hearing no objection, this item will not pass out of committee and obviously will not be reported out at the council meeting.

All right.

[Speaker 14] (2:12:27 - 2:12:27)
Thank you, colleagues.

[Speaker 1] (2:12:28 - 2:13:02)
All right. Thank you. So, let's see, bottom of page nine, document number 20891 in the 21st Ward.

Ordinance was referred on December 15th of 2021. Common address is 8613 South Marshfield. And the change request from an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RT3.5 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district. We have Howard White on this application.

[Speaker 29] (2:13:04 - 2:13:30)
Yes. Good afternoon, Chairman. I'm actually requesting the zoning change from RS1 to an RT3.5. I believe you have a copy of the Alderman's approval, Alderman Brookins. And this is actually converting a dwelling unit from a two unit to a rehab three unit for the basement garden apartment. And I'm requesting a favorable vote on this change, if possible.

[Speaker 1] (2:13:32 - 2:13:45)
All right. Mr. White, I know we have a letter of support from Alderman Brookins on this item. So, it seems the existing building has how many units?

[Speaker 29] (2:13:46 - 2:13:48)
It currently has two units.

[Speaker 1] (2:13:49 - 2:13:54)
You're requesting to basically build out the basement unit for a total of three units.

[Speaker 6] (2:13:54 - 2:13:55)
That is correct.

[Speaker 1] (2:13:56 - 2:14:23)
Okay. And again, we have gotten verification and support from Alderman Howard Brookins. Any questions for the applicant?

Hearing none, can I get a motion move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? So moved by Alderman Cardona. Alderman Cardona makes the motion.

Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, this item is passed.

[Speaker 8] (2:14:23 - 2:14:26)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (2:14:27 - 2:14:38)
All right. Top of page 10, document number 20885. I'm sorry.

Steve from Department of Planning. Yes, sir.

[Speaker 14] (2:14:38 - 2:14:39)
Yeah.

[Speaker 5] (2:14:39 - 2:15:19)
Hi, Alderman Steve Valenziano, Department of Planning. It has just come to my attention, and I don't know if Nick Fatikas is still on the call, but case number 20890 was passed by committee. It was a zoning change from an M2-2 to a C3-3 at 5435 North Walcott.

That property is within an industrial corridor, and it triggers section 17-130401 where it would need to go to plan commission for a hearing and recommendation before it comes to this body. And it just came to my attention now.

[Speaker 1] (2:15:19 - 2:15:24)
Right. Well, it's come to our attention too. It's in the industrial corridor, correct?

[Speaker 42] (2:15:25 - 2:15:25)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (2:15:25 - 2:15:35)
And therefore it needs to go to plan commission. So we're going to hold it in committee and we will, is the alderman aware of that also? Okay.

[Speaker 13] (2:15:36 - 2:15:38)
And then we'll recall it after.

[Speaker 1] (2:15:39 - 2:16:26)
Okay. So obviously it's got to go back to plan commission. Then we'll recall it if it has a successful motion at plan commission.

Correct, Steve? Correct. Okay.

Thank you. All right. Let me see.

We are on the top of page 11. I'm sorry. Top of page 10 in the 11th ward, 20885.

11th ward ordinance was referred on December 15th 2021. Change request. I'm sorry.

Address 3008 South Wells and the change request from an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district. We have Tyler Manick on this in the 11th ward.

[Speaker 14] (2:16:26 - 2:16:37)
Tyler, we have Mr. Manick.

[Speaker 17] (2:16:54 - 2:16:54)
Good.

[Speaker 35] (2:16:54 - 2:18:06)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Tyler Manick, Shane Banks, Kenny and Schwartz. I'm the attorney for the applicants, Ada Lee and Mark Sierra who own the vacant lot at 3008 South Wells.

The applicant seeks to construct a two dwelling unit building with a two car detached garage. The height of the building will be 38 feet. It is Ada and Mark's intent to reside in one of the units with their newborn child.

Ada's parents will reside in the other unit for this multi-generational home. The zoning change requested is from an RS3 single unit district to an RT4 residential two-flat town house multi-unit district. Prior to filing, the applicant met with Alderman Thompson and participated in a community meeting.

Following those meetings, Alderman Thompson gave the applicants a letter of support which has since been provided to the committee. With the support of the Alderman, the applicant respectfully requests this committee's favorable recommendation to approve the zoning map amendment of 3008 South Wells to an RT4 zoning district and I'll be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (2:18:07 - 2:18:19)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Thompson. Any questions, comments from committee members? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move to pass for the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 14] (2:18:21 - 2:18:23)
Alderman Cardona.

[Speaker 1] (2:18:23 - 2:19:01)

[Speaker 33] (2:19:01 - 2:20:28)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the board. My name is Paul Kopach with offices of 6767 North Milwaukee Avenue. I represent the applicants Lariba Group LLC and ATG LLC.

The applicants are seeking a map amendment from the M1-1 limited manufacturing business park district to that of C2-1 motor vehicle related commercial district in order to allow for the redevelopment of two commercial uses. The applicants propose to erect a 7067.06 square foot two-story gas station mini mart with accessory car wash and one dwelling unit on the second floor. The proposed two-story gas station mini mart with accessory car wash will have 10 off-street parking spaces with one ADA accessible space included.

The applicants also propose to demolish the existing 2244.44 square feet foot one-story restaurant building in order to erect a new 14,993 square foot retail strip mall with 27 off-street parking spaces. Subject lot is 83,376 square feet. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Garza.

We're prepared to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (2:20:30 - 2:20:42)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Garza. Any questions, comments from committee members? No hands up.

Can I get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 14] (2:20:43 - 2:20:44)
I'll move.

[Speaker 1] (2:20:44 - 2:20:52)
Alderman Raboyas makes that motion. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

All right.

[Speaker 33] (2:20:53 - 2:20:54)
Thank you very much. Be healthy.

[Speaker 1] (2:20:54 - 2:21:03)
All right. Let me just stop for a second here. Alderman Rodriguez, are you on the call?

[Speaker 8] (2:21:08 - 2:21:09)
Yes, sir. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:21:09 - 2:22:18)
Okay. Shall we move to your item based on your request? Yes.

Okay. That's what we'll do then. All right.

We're going to take it out of order. Committee members, we are going to page 12. Middle of page 12.

And this is document number 20869 in the 22nd Ward. Ordinance was referred on November 17th of 21. Common addresses 3201 through 3345 West 31st Street and 3100 through 3258 South Kedzie Avenue.

And the change request is C13 commercial manufacturing and employment district M33 heavy industry district and institutional business plan development number 1212 all to a C25 motor vehicle related commercial district. Then to the residential institutional business plan development. If Lenny Asaro is on the call, we're going to...

Is he in? Lenny?

[Speaker 4] (2:22:18 - 2:22:21)
I am here. I'm here, Chairman. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:22:21 - 2:22:23)
Talk about this exciting project in the 22nd Ward.

[Speaker 4] (2:22:24 - 2:23:26)
Thank you very much, Chairman. Good morning, afternoon to the committee members. My name is Lenny Asaro.

I am a partner at the law firm of Fagery, Drinker, Biddle, and Wreath LLP, located at 320 South Canal, Suite 3300, Chicago, Illinois. We represent the applicant, Chicago Southwest Development Corporation, which is an Illinois not-for-profit corporation. Also present, Chairman, are the following individuals.

Guy Medaglia, who is the president and CEO of the applicant and the president and CEO of St. Anthony Hospital. Next, Grace Rapp, managing principal of HDR Architects. And then lastly, Tom Trenolone, design director of HDR Architects.

They are available if there are any questions of them. This plan development application was considered and recommended for approval by the plan commission at its public meeting held on January 20th, 2022. Chairman, I respectfully request that the records from the plan commission be incorporated into the record of this committee meeting.

[Speaker 1] (2:23:29 - 2:23:38)
Cardona moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the records are now incorporated.

[Speaker 4] (2:23:38 - 2:28:07)
Thank you, Chairman. The project is for the expansion of the boundary of PD 1212, increasing the net site area from 10.8 acres to 28.89 acres. The application is to rezone the site from institutional business plan development 1212, ultimately to a C25, and then to institutional business amended business plan development 1212.

One of the primary purposes of the project is to relocate St. Anthony Hospital from its current location at 2875 West 19th Street to a new 12-story, 240-foot tall building on a mixed-use campus that also includes a medical office building, retail space, outdoor athletic fields, vocational school, surgical center, daycare, office building, parking garage, and accessory uses. The turn to slide three. Thank you.

With respect to actually slide three and what I said. Anyway, I'll just give a summary of it. This particular project will also contain the outpatient medical office building designed to adapt to the changing trends of the area and neighborhood.

It will have a recreational center, an athletic field that will be above the parking garage, retail, small business programs, and support services, an accelerator, a hospitality center, an early childhood education, and youth programming. It will also include a wellness program. Next slide.

This particular project will actually be broken up into sub areas. It'll be sub area A, B, C, and D. The sub area A is where the hospital will be located.

And albeit the project will be developed in phases, the complete build-out, which is the slide that is shown right now, shows the hospital located at the corner of 31st and Kedzie. The athletic field, which sits above the parking garage at the southwestern portion of the site with a parking field at the southeast, along with the retail and other office buildings, and then the daycare facility at the northwest side of the site that runs along Kedzie. And if we could turn to the last two slides that we had sent over there, basically it's the view from southeast, I'm sorry, view from northeast Massing Plan, as well as a view from northwest Massing Plan.

Chairman, the applicant has worked closely with Alderman Rodriguez of the 22nd Ward, the community, DPD, and CDOT on the refinement of this project. Albeit the timeline, as reported to the plan commission, was April of 2021. This is a project that has been long in the making and the hard work of Guy Medaglia and the whole team at CSDC to acquire the land that ultimately will comprise this 30-acre site.

Last year, the city and CSDC entered into a redevelopment agreement whereby CSDC will be acquiring the former Washburn trade school site located at the southwest corner of 31st and Kedzie. But since April, the team has met consistently with DPD. This project has had multiple community meetings and has received substantial and overwhelming support from the community led by Alderman Rodriguez.

On behalf of the applicant, I do wish to point out and thank Alderman Rodriguez for his diligence and hard work on this project, not only during the time that he was Alderman, but he's been around this project and familiar with it and supportive of it even before becoming Alderman. His staff, I want to thank Brian Hacker from DPD, Noah Sofraniec, Gerardo Garcia, Zoning Administrator Patrick Murphy, and of course Commissioner Maurice Cox for their work and feedback that helped to refine this project since April of last year. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:28:10 - 2:28:12)
Alderman Mike Rodriguez.

[Speaker 4] (2:28:13 - 2:28:14)
Thank you, Chairman Toney.

[Speaker 8] (2:28:14 - 2:29:25)
Thank you, Lenny Asaro, for the presentation. And I'll be brief given Lenny's presentation and given that my colleagues would like to get lunch, I'm sure. I'm very excited about this project.

Our community has been aware of this project for a long time. It has significant community support. I received several hundred letters of support for this project, and we've had a number of community meetings.

It's gone through a lot of changes that I think are beneficial to the project, to the community, and to our city as a whole. This is a great project where we're going to build a new hospital on the southwest side of Chicago. An existing hospital that's been in our community for several generations will continue to be in our community.

I'd like to let my colleagues know that St. Anthony Hospital, through a Chicago Tribune study, was the number one hospital. The highest percentage of those receiving their vaccinations were from the hardest hit communities, and they have a significant amount of charity care. We welcome them to continue to be in our community, and I ask the favorable consideration of my colleagues after the unanimous and enthusiastic support of the Planning Commission.

Thank you, Mr. Chair.

[Speaker 1] (2:29:27 - 2:29:36)
Thank you, Alderman, and exciting, ambitious project. Just for the record, the existing St. Anthony's is how far from this site?

[Speaker 12] (2:29:38 - 2:29:44)
It's a little over. This is Guy Medaglia. It's just a little over one mile.

[Speaker 1] (2:29:45 - 2:29:51)
Okay, because I know at Planning Commission it came up about any kind of adaptive reuse of the hospital.

[Speaker 12] (2:29:52 - 2:30:20)
Yes, and it will be. As I mentioned, DPD meeting that I have several individuals looking at it. The lead individuals looking at it will turn it into a senior center, and the reason being is because it's close to the train line, across from the park, and the way the rooms are set up, they felt that it was laid out for them.

[Speaker 1] (2:30:22 - 2:30:32)
And they will be serving the community at that site, and I would assume relatively seamless transition. I know this is an ambitious project, so.

[Speaker 30] (2:30:32 - 2:30:32)
Correct.

[Speaker 12] (2:30:33 - 2:30:59)
Well, relatively seamless. It will be planned as part of the transition. That's our objective.

We do not want, nor would we recommend to either one of the two individuals looking at the property to leave it vacant for any period of time. We would do it almost, I hate to use the word seamless, but very, very tight and very close. So that would be very important.

[Speaker 1] (2:31:00 - 2:31:09)
All right. Thank you. Questions for the team and the Alderman?

Alderman Raymond Lopez.

[Speaker 19] (2:31:09 - 2:31:43)
Thank you, Chairman. Thank you, members of the committee. Actually, I just have one simple question.

First off, I think this is a great project. Congratulations to our colleague. But has any, will any work be done to improve Kedzie Avenue access to the Stevenson Expressway?

Because I know that issue, I'm sure that'll be a highly used exit ramp. Are we going to see CDOT or the developers work to try to correct and upgrade that area as well?

[Speaker 42] (2:31:44 - 2:31:44)
Yes.

[Speaker 12] (2:31:44 - 2:32:14)
Alderman Lopez, this is Guy Medaglia again. Actually, we have been working with CDOT. I have made multiple trips.

Actually, the latest one was in November to talk about support for not only Kedzie, but also a ramp for 55 for easy ingress and egress. So yes. And by the way, a lot of good support on this.

Support hasn't been the problem with that. It just got to get started.

[Speaker 4] (2:32:16 - 2:32:19)
I'm sorry. Go ahead. Go to Alderman.

[Speaker 8] (2:32:20 - 2:32:21)
Chairman, if I may.

[Speaker 14] (2:32:23 - 2:32:24)
Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 8] (2:32:25 - 2:32:58)
Thanks for the question, Alderman. And I really appreciate the support. It's taken very well.

The one other thing I might add to the interest of my colleagues is that, you know, this is formerly an industrial corridor. And now what we have here is, you know, the opposite of that, you know, building public benefits, hospital and community space here. So it's very exciting.

But yeah, a part of what we're thinking about is traffic and congestion, particularly truck traffic as it moves through this community. And thanks for the question.

[Speaker 4] (2:32:59 - 2:33:18)
All right. And Alderman Lopez, that there was just also entered direct part of the PD statement includes traffic management improvements for signalization. So we've worked closely with CDOT, and that will be implemented part of the project, there'll be a dedication of some of the land along 31st and Kedzie.

Thank you. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:33:19 - 2:33:21)
Thank you, Alderman. Alderman Pat Dowell.

[Speaker 32] (2:33:23 - 2:33:39)
I thank you, Mr. Chairman, I might have missed this in the presentation. So I hope this may be an appropriate question. There's the current St. Anthony's Hospital. This is not a replacement for that. This is a an additional facility, correct?

[Speaker 12] (2:33:40 - 2:33:54)
Yes, that is correct. This is the existing St. Anthony Hospital, we will be moving our employees only into a brand new brand new state of the future facility.

[Speaker 32] (2:33:54 - 2:33:59)
So will you still maintain an emergency room? Will you have?

[Speaker 12] (2:33:59 - 2:34:49)
Oh, absolutely. This is not going to be like other. This is the same leadership team, same board of directors.

The hospital actually, although it's going to keep the same number of beds, we're going to go from two beds per room to single bed occupancy. And we're going to, lay this out with the help of the community and our employees much more efficiently. But everything's the same, the emergency department, we will still continue with a children's hospital, as well as an adult hospital, only with a lot of improvements.

Everything the same, but improvements. Behavioral health facility, all that will be included.

[Speaker 32] (2:34:50 - 2:35:07)
All right. And then can you just tell me how many beds you have now? And the last question would be the recreation center that you're, the gymnasium and the swimming pool, is this a membership based center or is this just open to the public?

[Speaker 12] (2:35:08 - 2:35:56)
It actually is, it's going to be funded. Okay. So one of the important things is Chicago Southwest Development Corp is going to take any earnings after expenses and put it back into a charitable fund to fund a lot of the community programs on the campus project, as well as off project.

So we are actually in talks with a not-for-profit organization now to actually help us run the recreational facility. And then in addition to that, on the recreational side, we'll be using some of it for our rehab patients that will need things the gym or the swimming pool as part of their rehab program.

[Speaker 32] (2:35:57 - 2:36:10)
Okay. Well, I focused on the sanctuary for at-risk youth and just wanted to be clear on, this is not a membership based recreational center.

[Speaker 12] (2:36:11 - 2:36:54)
This whole campus was designed for the use of the program. So that is very important to know. And as for example, Lawndale Christian, they have a community center with workout equipment.

There is a very small, slight fee that is paid, but nowhere near a gym or a for-profit type of establishment. Cost for the fees would be to maintain the equipment, keep it clean. Those are the only things that we would be looking at.

[Speaker 32] (2:36:55 - 2:37:04)
All right. So the answer is there will be some fee based something. Oh, I hear what you said.

How many beds?

[Speaker 14] (2:37:06 - 2:37:07)
151.

[Speaker 1] (2:37:07 - 2:37:07)
Okay.

[Speaker 14] (2:37:09 - 2:37:10)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:37:11 - 2:37:18)
Any other questions, comments? If not, can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that we do to determine form?

[Speaker 33] (2:37:19 - 2:37:20)
So moved Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 1] (2:37:20 - 2:37:27)
Alderman Lopez makes the motion. Any objections? Hearing none, this item is passed as revised.

[Speaker 4] (2:37:29 - 2:37:29)
Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:37:30 - 2:38:16)
I know you have an important committee hearing up and you'd like to be heard next. So I'm going to move to you. And that is...

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. What's our page? We're on page 13.

And this is document number 20729, 8th Ward. Ordinance was referred on May 26th of 21. Common address 9619 through 9645 South Cottage Grove Avenue.

Change request. M12 limited manufacturing business park district to an RM5 residential multi-unit district and then to a plan development. We have Carol Stubblefield on this application.

Carol.

[Speaker 13] (2:38:24 - 2:38:32)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. For the record. Can you not hear me?

[Speaker 1] (2:38:34 - 2:38:44)
Hold on a second. Hold on a second. I don't mean to...

I'm going to short circuit you on this one because I spoke... Can you hear me?

[Speaker 14] (2:38:45 - 2:38:46)
Hello, this is Carol Stubblefield.

[Speaker 1] (2:38:46 - 2:39:07)
Yeah, Carol, can you hear me? Yes, I can, sir. Okay.

I made a mistake. I'm going to have to hear you a little bit later because I was... Okay.

So I made a mistake reading into the record.

[Speaker 30] (2:39:07 - 2:39:07)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:39:08 - 2:39:42)
I'm moving in on behalf of Chairman Dowell. I'm going to page 11 at the top. And I have document number 20884 T1 in the third ward ordinance was referred on December 15th of 2021.

Common address is 4009 through 4011 South Wabash and the change request M13 limited manufacturing business park district to B22 neighborhood mixed use district. Our attorney on this is Liz Butler.

[Speaker 15] (2:39:44 - 2:42:52)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Liz Butler. I am a partner with the law firm of Elrod Friedman, LLP located at 325 North LaSalle Street in Chicago.

Our firm represents the applicant in this matter, Link Holdings, LLC. I'm joined today by DeAndrea Anderson, who is the COO of the applicant. The applicant is requesting a rezoning of the subject property this I think is not the our presentation that was showing on the screen.

I'll wait as you guys tee that up. Our property is 4009 through 4011 South Wabash Avenue and the change request is a request to go from the M13 limited manufacturing business park district to the B22 neighborhood mixed use district. The subject property is vacant and unimproved.

It's a parcel of land that's owned by the city of Chicago. The applicant is seeking to acquire the property from the city in order to incorporate it into its adjacent site, which is owned as part of the B22 district. The applicant owns and operates Halo Security Group, which is a minority and veteran owned security guard company that serves the Chicagoland area and the Midwest region.

Halo's offices are, that's, yes, that's ours. Halo's offices are located at 4007 South Wabash, immediately adjacent to into the north of the subject property and you can see that on your screen now. Halo's offices are in the building labeled as parcel A and the subject property is labeled as parcel B in the slide that's showing on your screen right now.

The property will be improved with a five parking space surface parking lot and landscaped area that will serve Halo's operations next door. The request of rezoning is a condition of the city's agreement to sell the property to the applicant. The applicant worked with the Department of Planning and Development staff who reviewed the site plan and provided feedback and input on the layout and design of the parking lot.

The proposal was also presented to the Community Development Commission at its hearing on January 18. The CDC voted unanimously to authorize the sale. The proposal will reactivate what is currently a vacant and underutilized parcel that's owned by the city and we'll put it back into productive use by a Chicago based small business.

Alderman Dowell issued a letter of support for the project and a copy of that letter was submitted to the committee in advance of this hearing. We thank the committee for its favorable considerations of this matter and respectfully request your recommendation of support for this request and our team is available to answer any questions that the committee might have.

[Speaker 1] (2:42:53 - 2:42:55)
Thank you, Liz. Alderman Dowell.

[Speaker 32] (2:42:59 - 2:43:25)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for moving this up on the schedule. I want to thank the applicant for his investment in this community. It's a very simple zoning change to allow the applicant to provide a parking space for the business, which has been in our ward for a few years.

[Speaker 14] (2:43:25 - 2:43:26)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:43:27 - 2:44:20)
All right, questions for Alderman Dowell or the applicant? I don't see any hands up. Can I get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that would determine?

Alderman Austin. Alderman Austin makes that motion. Any objections to her motion?

Hearing none, the item is passed. All right. Thank you.

Okay, thank you, Chairman. All right, now, bottom of page 10, we're going back to the regular order. Document number 209008 Ward.

Ordinance was referred on December 15th of 21. The common address is 8344 South Anthony Avenue. And the change request from an RS2 residential single unit detached house district to an RT4 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district.

We have Chandra Logan.

[Speaker 36] (2:44:34 - 2:44:38)
Good afternoon, my name is Chandra Logan. Can everyone hear me?

[Speaker 1] (2:44:39 - 2:44:40)
We can, Chandra. Proceed.

[Speaker 36] (2:44:42 - 2:45:06)
Okay, yes, my name is Chandra Logan. I have a residence at 8344 South Anthony. And I'm requesting to rezone from a single family RS2 detached to an RT4 residential two flat, two story with three dwelling residents utilizing the basement.

That's what it is, utilizing the basement.

[Speaker 1] (2:45:10 - 2:45:15)
And have you, how have you interacted with the alderman or the community or neighbors?

[Speaker 36] (2:45:17 - 2:45:48)
Yes, I did. I sent out all of the proper documents in regards to notifying the neighbors. I received one call.

She just wanted to make sure we weren't rezoning the entire block. From my understanding, I was under the assumption that the letter to the alderman came from zoning. Because when I did go into the alderman's office to seek their approval, they said that I requested a letter at that particular time.

And they said that they would receive a letter through zoning. So I'm sorry if that was something that I picked up on this.

[Speaker 1] (2:45:49 - 2:46:08)
No, I wanted your, I wanted to know how you went about the process and you did it in the correct way. You immediate neighbors are aware the alderman is aware and we have received a letter of support from alderman Michelle Harris. Oh, so with that, do we have any questions, comments from committee members?

[Speaker 19] (2:46:11 - 2:46:13)
Move to pass chairman. Hearing none.

[Speaker 1] (2:46:13 - 2:46:24)
Alderman Raymond Lopez moves to pass by the same roll call that you've determined quorum. Any objections to his motion? And hearing none, the item is passed.

Good luck to you, Ms. Logan.

[Speaker 36] (2:46:27 - 2:46:29)
Thank you. All right, everyone on this line, please be safe.

[Speaker 1] (2:46:30 - 2:47:05)
Thank you. All right, middle of page 11. We are on document number 20375 in the 26th ward.

Ordinance was referred in April 22nd of 2020. Common address on this case is 1201 through 1209 North California Avenue. Also 2744 through 2758 West Division Street.

The change request from the B11 neighborhood shopping district will be 35 community shopping district and then to the plan development. We have Steve Friedland on this case.

[Speaker 14] (2:47:08 - 2:47:09)
Good afternoon.

[Speaker 3] (2:47:09 - 2:47:12)
Let me make sure I'm in.

[Speaker 1] (2:47:12 - 2:47:16)
I think I am now loud and clear. Excellent.

[Speaker 3] (2:47:17 - 2:52:27)
Yes. So, Mr. Chairman, my name is Steve Friedland with the law firm of Applegate and Thorn Thompson here on behalf of the applicant Hispanic Housing Development Corporation for a plan development at the Northeast corner of California. And you can go to the next slide.

I will say that I'm the maybe the next one after that, please. The I have with me on the call from Hispanic Housing, Paul Rodin, who is the president of Hispanic Housing, Steve Poros, who's their vice president of real estate development and Ken DeMuth, our architect from Papa George Haynes. This project, which is located on the Paseo Boricua at I mentioned Division in California intends to be a 64 unit development, nine stories directly across from Humboldt Park.

This is a 100% affordable development. And why don't you go to the next slide, which I think is the, is the building. So here, here's, here's the building.

Hispanic Housing has been in existence for over 40 years, and its mission is to develop affordable housing in Chicago's Latino neighborhoods. This project, which is on the western edge of the Paseo is important to Hispanic Housing because they feel it really will be the western anchor of a revitalization of the Paseo. It will offer residents significant walkable amenities and transportation opportunities.

We have worked for a long time on this project. We've worked with Alderman Maldonado and many other local partners for several years. As many of you know, these affordable developments take a long time to come together.

And this one is no exception, but it really was a result of Alderman Maldonado's guidance and strong conviction to see a building like this on the Paseo across from Humboldt Park. I, why don't we go to the next slide. Let me give you some of the details of the project.

So the project that I say is 100% affordable. This shows the breakdown of the affordable units. We have units at the 30%, 50%, and 60% AMI levels.

But as you see, you know, there's a, almost half of the units are at the 30% AMI level. In addition, the unit mix on this, and Mr. Chairman, as you know, I present a number of affordable developments for our clients to the committee. This one is somewhat unique in that 40 of the units in this building are three bedroom units.

This is truly a family development, an affordable family development with 43 bedroom units and 15 two bedroom units. So, you know, the opportunity for people to live across the street from Humboldt Park in a beautiful new building is really kind of unprecedented. If you go to the next slide, I would just touch on some of the significant benefits that we, you know, we'll be providing with the project.

Obviously there's significant public infrastructure improvements with respect to sidewalk and road work. We have, we believe a strong social impact on this community by retaining affordable housing in an area which is gentrifying. There will be retail on the first floor, which adds economic traffic to Division Street.

And obviously the affordable housing that we spoke to. Significant job creation through construction. We did want to mention that Hispanic housing will have a youth build construction apprenticeship program, which will allow young people to get involved in the trades, which is very important as well.

The final thing I would say before taking questions and letting anybody from our team speak is that this was a process that took some time because we did work with the Department of Planning and Development on revisions to our plans to come up with the design that we ultimately are presenting to you. Which again, I think the team is very proud of, and we're hoping that all of you on the committee view it as a wonderful addition to this neighborhood. With that, we'll certainly take any questions you might have.

[Speaker 1] (2:52:30 - 2:52:30)
Thank you, Steve.

[Speaker 3] (2:52:31 - 2:52:46)
Mr. Chairman, if I, I'm sorry, one thing I forgot. This is a plan development. We did go to the plan commission on December 16th.

So we would appreciate it if the committee would incorporate the findings and proceedings in the plan commission into the record.

[Speaker 1] (2:52:48 - 2:53:48)
So Alderman Cardona moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call as used to determine form. Any objections? Hearing none.

The records are incorporated. Your presentation, I believe it's complete. Um, I know I, as a member of plan commission, um, Alderman Maldonado spoke, uh, very strongly in, in his support.

Um, I, I don't think he's on the call today. No, he's not. Um, the, um, do we have questions, comments?

Um, hearing none. Can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine form? I'll move by Alderman Wagesback makes that motion.

Any objections to his motion? Hearing none. This item is passed as revised.

All right. Congratulations.

[Speaker 3] (2:53:49 - 2:53:50)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (2:53:50 - 2:54:14)
All right. Thank you. Now we're on the bottom of page 12, document number 20773, 11th ward ordinance was referred on June 23rd of 21.

Common address is 3900 South normal. The change request M two, three light industry district to a plan development. We have Barry Ash on this with slides.

[Speaker 14] (2:54:32 - 2:54:33)
Mr. Ash.

[Speaker 20] (2:54:44 - 2:54:46)
Sorry for that.

[Speaker 1] (2:54:46 - 2:54:47)
All right, Barry.

[Speaker 20] (2:54:47 - 2:54:48)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (2:54:48 - 2:54:53)
Okay. Uh, let's talk about the 11th ward on normal street.

[Speaker 20] (2:54:54 - 2:56:21)
Okay. I'm just, uh, okay, here I am. Okay.

So for the record, my name is Barry Ash. I'm an attorney, but the law firm of Ashano's Friedman and Logan, and I represent the owner of the subject property, which is 3900 South normal TMG LLC. We were before the plan commission on January 20th, uh, 22 and made our presentation where the request is to rezone the subject property to the M two dash three light industry district to a plan development.

The applicant is proposing to construct on a vacant 8.1 acre site, a 169, 838 square foot class, a multi-tenant industrial building. As I set forth, we were before, Oh, I should also back up and say on this call, I do have one of the members of the applicants who could testify or will testify to a short PowerPoint presentation. If the committee would like to hear that.

And he can also answer any questions along with me regarding this development. Um, as I said, we were before the plan commission and one 2022, and I would like to incorporate the transcript from the plan commissions, their recommendation into this committee. Uh, hearing.

[Speaker 1] (2:56:22 - 2:56:36)
So with that Alderman, uh, uh, Lopez moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum, any objections to his motion hearing on the records are now incorporated.

[Speaker 20] (2:56:37 - 2:57:13)
Okay. Thank you. And we did work very hard with Alderman Thompson of the 11th ward, uh, to make presentations before any interested, uh, parties within the neighborhood.

And, uh, we went through, of course, the process of being approved by the plan commission. Uh, the Alderman did present his letter of recommendation when we filed with the committee on zoning. And I believe you have that in your record and he also recommended the approval of the PD.

And with that, again, I do have representative. If you want to go through a short PowerPoint presentation.

[Speaker 1] (2:57:14 - 2:57:57)
Well, I was, as a member of plan commission, um, I was, I saw the PowerPoints presentation. I believe I might be not entirely correct, but the effect of the PowerPoint was to talk about, uh, logistics, uh, air quality and some other, um, concerns the neighborhood had. And I know there was a judge, there was a movement of the, of the staff, but our new movement of the building from one side of the, of the campus to the other, uh, is there a, a will of the committee to hear the, see the PowerPoint.

Raymond Lopez.

[Speaker 19] (2:57:59 - 2:58:11)
Thank you, chairman. Actually, I, if there's a part of the presentation that deals with the transportation impact, I'd like to see that because I know Pershing clearly has a lot of traffic and I'm sure that was discussed. Is that part of that presentation?

[Speaker 1] (2:58:12 - 2:58:14)
So why don't you proceed on the PowerPoint?

[Speaker 20] (2:58:14 - 2:58:51)
All right. If, um, Barry Misner is present with me, if he could, uh, go over the PowerPoint presentation again, he is the member of the applicant and he is very well versed on, uh, all the, the situation here with this development. Barry, are you on?

Yes, I am. Okay. So Barry, if you could just introduce yourself, uh, and just, uh, be able to, uh, direct the PowerPoint presentation.

So you could testify, uh, briefly about the proposal and then you can answer any question that Alderman Raymond Lopez may have.

[Speaker 9] (2:58:53 - 3:02:32)
Uh, okay. Thank you. Thank you, Barry.

Thank you, uh, Mr. Chairman and committee members. Uh, uh, I, I think that this is a slightly different PowerPoint, but I can just go by the slides that I see. This is obviously, uh, a dimensional look at the property from the Northwest corner.

Uh, Barry Ash mentioned that the property was moved off this, this property borders, uh, uh, a U-Haul facility to the East, Pershing to the North, Wallace to the West and the railroad to the South. There's, uh, the site. Uh, obviously located just South of Sox park and just West of the, of 94, uh, South of Persian.

You can go back to, uh, uh, you can go, you can go forward to, uh, maybe a slide five, I think. There we go. So you can see here, uh, the building had been flipped in two ways.

One is the docks were originally facing West. They're now facing East, which is facing the U-Haul facility along normal versus the car wash along Wallace. Uh, the building was moved up closer to a Pershing and we moved the parking along the South elevation, uh, so that it would have bought the railroad.

So you wouldn't drive by the building and just see parking along in front. And that allowed us to create kind of a street state that you saw in the first slide, uh, where there was a proposed mural on the North elevation. You can go to the next slide.

These are the, uh, the four building elevations. Uh, the one on the top being the West, that's where the office entrances would be for the, for the tenants up to four tenants that would face again, Wallace, the car wash facility, the second elevation, which is North along Pershing. That's where we're creating the streetscape.

That is a mural that we are going to do. That is not representative of what we are, are planning. We're going to, uh, get some community involvement and figure that out.

But that is just a placeholder of a mural that we will put along the North elevation along Pershing. The third elevation is what faces the railroad and the South parking lot. And then the, uh, the, uh, East elevation, which is where the loading docks are, which faces normal and the, and the, uh, U-Haul facility.

Um, you can go back to, uh, uh, slide five. So you can see here, what we did is we, we kind of buffered with landscaping along, uh, the Northwest corner and along the entire North elevation. And then in that little pocket of landscaping along, uh, the East, East of the building along Pershing.

So that will, uh, shield kind of the parking lot on the, on the West side of the building. And then the car parking and the trailer in and out, uh, along the East side of the building. As far as answering a question specifically on traffic, not a traffic engineer, we don't have one on the call.

We did go through a pretty exhausted process under the new, the city's new traffic and air quality ordinance. So traffic studies, air quality studies were done. And we went through, uh, with the various departments, uh, and, uh, uh, responded to community feedback on those reports.

And then there's, there's, I think we can go to the, the, this is just essentially a detailed landscape drawing of what I kind of described in the, uh, colored site plan of showing the various landscapes. I'm not going to obviously go through the matrix of all of the plantings that are going to be done. And then the last slide is essentially the first one kind of showing you that Northwest, uh, uh, dimension relating to, uh, how the building sits on Pershing, uh, looking from the Northwest.

[Speaker 19] (3:02:34 - 3:02:49)
So I guess my question chairman would be on either Wallace or normal, are there going to be new, are there traffic signal lights? I don't, I don't immediately recall if those have traffic signals at either of those corners.

[Speaker 9] (3:02:50 - 3:02:56)
We have those lights at both of the corners at both Wallace and at normal and both.

[Speaker 19] (3:02:56 - 3:03:07)
So are those just regular three stops, slow and go lights, or are they actually going to be upgraded to having the arrows for truck traffic and other things like that?

[Speaker 9] (3:03:08 - 3:03:23)
Based on the traffic counts, they won't need arrows. Um, in, uh, the, the, the impact on these traffic wise by the KLA who did the, the traffic consulting, uh, the traffic report did not show any need to change those lights.

[Speaker 1] (3:03:24 - 3:03:44)
Okay. Thank you, chairman. Thank you, Alderman.

Any other questions? Um, and I, I know, uh, as I said, Alderman Thompson, we have a letter of support. He spoke, uh, very much in favor of this at planning commission.

Um, can I get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that we do in permanent quorum?

[Speaker 19] (3:03:47 - 3:03:49)
So move chairman Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 1] (3:03:49 - 3:03:57)
Alderman Raymond Lopez makes the motion. Any objections to the motion? Uh, hearing none of this item is passed as revised.

[Speaker 42] (3:03:57 - 3:03:58)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:03:58 - 3:04:34)
All right, folks. We're on the last couple, I believe. So we're on page 13 and this is the one I, uh, spoke out of order, but we're back to it.

Number 20729 eighth ward ordinance was referred on May 26th of 21. Common address is 9619 through 9645 South Cottage Grove Avenue. The change request M one, two limited manufacturing business park district to RM five residential multi-unit district, and then to plan development.

So my apologies, Carol, but you're back on the call.

[Speaker 13] (3:04:35 - 3:05:18)
I'm here, Mr. Chairman. Okay, proceed. Thank you.

So, uh, right. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, uh, for the record, Carol Stubblefield with Neil offices at 20 South Clark here on behalf of the applicant Trinity 95th Cottage Grove planned community development series LLC with me to answer questions is Patricia Eggleston, our executive vice president and general counsel for Trinity and Philip Craig Johnson, the project architect with Johnson and Lee architects. Mr. Chairman, as you point out, this is a plan development. The matter was heard and unanimously approved at the Chicago plan commission on December 16th.

We asked that the findings and conclusions of the Chicago plan commission and all documents given to you, the department of planning and development be adopted into today's record.

[Speaker 42] (3:05:23 - 3:05:23)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (3:05:26 - 3:05:27)
Hearing no objection.

[Speaker 14] (3:05:33 - 3:05:33)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (3:05:34 - 3:05:45)
Let me repeat. I got distracted by staff again. All right.

Ultimate low-cost boost to incorporate the records from the plank commission by the same role call that we do to determine quorum.

[Speaker 13] (3:05:45 - 3:06:07)
Any objections. Hearing none. Carol, please proceed.

Right. Mr. Chairman. I want to point out also that we should have a substitute ordinance on this matter.

The rezoning is from an M one two to a B two three neighborhood mixed use district and not the RM five. The matter was re noticed prior to the plan commission.

[Speaker 1] (3:06:08 - 3:06:14)
Okay. So that was incorporating the records from the plank mission that zoning change. So we don't need any further, further action.

[Speaker 13] (3:06:15 - 3:07:48)
Okay, perfect. Okay. So the proposed residential business plan development is for the construction of a much needed 132 unit affordable senior housing project in the Pullman community area and the cottage Grove Heights neighborhood.

The senior housing project is adjacent to the applicants existing 23 acre development. And as part of the applicants development vision and plan for the area, this is a transit serve location and the project will be developed in phases. Phase one construction, including 70 units and 44 parking spaces is anticipated to start in the fourth quarter of 2022 and be completed in the fourth quarter of 2023 phase two will follow the construction and lease up of phase one.

The proposed project, as I mentioned, is an affordable senior housing development that is subject to the 2021 affordable requirements ordinance that said Trinity plans to exceed the ordinance requirements. And of the 70 units planned for phase one Trinity will provide 16 units at 30% AMI and 54 units, 60% AMI Trinity obtained all of the approvals. Necessary for Chicago plan commission, including C dot fire MLPD.

And the project will comply with the city's goals for diversity and minority participation, sustainability and stormwater management policies. The applicant is complied with all notice requirements and has a full support of the community and older woman, Michelle Harris, who I believe is either on the call or her staff is on the call to express her support for this project that completes our testimony this afternoon. We respectfully request your approval of this matter.

And the team is available to answer any questions. Thank you.

[Speaker 19] (3:07:59 - 3:08:00)
You need a chairman.

[Speaker 14] (3:08:02 - 3:08:03)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (3:08:03 - 3:08:36)
We have a letter of support from Alderman Harris. Any questions, comments on this amazing project actually hearing as amended. All right.

Alderman Raymond Lopez moved to incorporate. It's been a long day. Lopez moves to pass on this by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections to the motion carrying on this item is passed as revised.

[Speaker 13] (3:08:36 - 3:08:38)
Thank you. Chairman and members. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:08:39 - 3:09:12)
Thank you. Next to last item is number. I don't know because I have another comment.

Uh, number two on page 13, number 20841 T1 in the second ward ordinance was referred on September 14th of 21. Common address is 1690 North Elston Avenue. And the change request from M23 light industry district to C32 commercial manufacturing and employment district.

Tim Barton. Tim.

[Speaker 11] (3:09:13 - 3:10:12)
Good afternoon, Chairman Tunney, members of the committee. For the record. My name is Tim Barton.

I'm an attorney with the law firm of Thomas Raines. I'm representing the applicant and owner written adventures, LLC. This matter was heard by the Chicago plan commission in December on December 16th, 2021.

So there are two procedural matters that the committee's action. Um, one, a substitute was submitted, um, actually amending the initial request from, um, changing from an M3 dash three to a C3 dash two, but then that was, uh, substituted with a C3 dash three, which was, um, noticed before the plan commission prior to the bank. Um, there was also a substitute, uh, for the legal description.

[Speaker 1] (3:10:14 - 3:10:19)
Okay. So we will, all those will be under one vote to incorporate the records from the bank.

[Speaker 30] (3:10:20 - 3:10:21)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (3:10:22 - 3:10:39)
All right. With that being said, um, Alderman Raymond Lopez moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call. It was used to determine form.

Any objections to that? Hearing none, uh, the records are incorporated. Both of those issues are addressed.

[Speaker 11] (3:10:39 - 3:11:57)
Good. Thank you. Um, so let's start the slides.

Um, the site is at the Southwest corner of, uh, Elston Avenue and LaVancia. It's in the, uh, North branch industrial corridor. Um, it's on Elston, a block and a half North of, uh, North Avenue.

Uh, it's improved with a two-story commercial building, which is in the next slide. Um, let's see. It's an existing building, uh, about 90 years old.

Um, as I say, it's a change from an M3 dash three heavy industry district to a C3 dash three, uh, commercial manufacturing and employment district. Because of the change, uh, from an M to a non-M district, it's required review by the Toronto Plan Commission. Um, and in addition, the applicant paid a industrial corridor system emergency of $215,906.75. The purpose of the rezoning is to broaden the uses here.

[Speaker 1] (3:11:57 - 3:11:59)
Speak up a little bit or closer in.

[Speaker 11] (3:12:00 - 3:12:01)
Sure. Yeah. Is that better?

[Speaker 1] (3:12:02 - 3:12:02)
Yeah.

[Speaker 11] (3:12:03 - 3:13:42)
The purpose of the rezoning is to broaden the uses here, uh, to allow office use beyond the 9,000 square foot limit that's currently allowed in its M zoning. Uh, there will be two phases to the, uh, to the work. That's on the next slide.

Thanks. Um, on the right-hand side, the smooth portion is the original building that's being renovated. There's a small addition that's, um, immediately planned.

Um, and then to the rear, um, of the lot there on the Bessley court side will be a two-story addition for offices and a 50-space parking lot. Um, current, uh, brick facade of the original building will be maintained. Um, on the next slide, you can see the office, uh, and broad addition will have, um, an aluminum, uh, planning system.

Uh, as I said, the industrial corridor fee was paid for this. Um, the zoning has the support of, uh, North River Works organization, as well as Alderman Hopkins, um, and a letter from the Alderman was submitted previously. This is the first floor plan going, uh, uh, parking at the rear and, uh, office space.

[Speaker 14] (3:13:45 - 3:13:49)
Okay. Well, we do have a letter.

[Speaker 1] (3:13:51 - 3:13:54)
Yeah. Are you, are you finished, Tim?

[Speaker 42] (3:13:54 - 3:13:54)
Yeah.

[Speaker 1] (3:13:55 - 3:14:17)
Okay. So, um, we do have a letter of support from Alderman Hopkins. Um, and for the record is how many parking spaces in this?

50. Okay. Well, comments, other questions?

Alderman Hopkins, I see you on the call. Would you like to discuss this?

[Speaker 7] (3:14:18 - 3:14:29)
Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yeah, uh, I'm in full support of this and, uh, we do have a letter on file, uh, no known opposition from the community or the surrounding area, and I would urge an aye vote. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:14:33 - 3:15:40)
All right. Uh, thank you, uh, Alderman. Any questions for the Alderman?

Hearing none, can I get a motion to move to pass the same, uh, roll call that was used to determine quorum? So moved. Alderman Hopkins makes the motion.

Any objections to the motion? Hearing none, this item is, uh, passed as revised. So, um, all right now, before we adjourn, um, I want to go back again, Alderman Hopkins, uh, do not pass issue, um, and that is on page nine in the middle.

I'm going, this is item number 20628T1, the address 1628 through 1630 North Wells. Um, earlier I reported that it would not be reported out, but to clarify it, I mean that it would not be reported out favorably. It'll be reported out as do not pass.

Any questions on that?

[Speaker 7] (3:15:42 - 3:15:57)
Yeah. Just, uh, for the record then in that instance, the city council adoption of the committee report would be tantamount to a decline to support the proposed zoning change.

[Speaker 1] (3:15:57 - 3:16:00)
The report would have a do not pass on your item.

[Speaker 7] (3:16:00 - 3:16:05)
Right. So that's, that's final action then at the city council level as part of the report.

[Speaker 1] (3:16:05 - 3:16:12)
Okay. So, yeah, that's fine. We want to execute it at the council level as a do not pass.

[Speaker 7] (3:16:13 - 3:16:13)
Okay. Very good.

[Speaker 1] (3:16:14 - 3:16:24)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. All right. And that is with the, the law department's, um, advice on that.

So, all right. All right. I don't have any other business at hand.

Can I get a motion?

[Speaker 10] (3:16:24 - 3:16:25)
I move we adjourn.

[Speaker 1] (3:16:26 - 3:16:29)
Alderman Hopkins moved to adjourn. Any objections?

[Speaker 10] (3:16:30 - 3:16:31)
Everyone objects.

[Speaker 1] (3:16:31 - 3:16:39)
All right. Well, then we'll go to 15th ward and make some, make some zoning changes. Without the Alderman's support.

[Speaker 14] (3:16:39 - 3:16:44)
How about that? All right, buddy. Well, we'll see y'all on budget.

Have a great afternoon. Thanks.
