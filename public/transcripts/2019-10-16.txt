[Speaker 7] (13:01 - 13:05)
Oh, let me discover you.

[Speaker 2] (16:01 - 20:01)
Oh, let me discover you. Good morning. Good morning.

The Committee on Zoning is ready to start. Thank you. I So, we will now reconvene the 2 p.m. meeting as of yesterday. I think we have one piece of business to discuss and that's the substitute ordinance on cannabis. So, do any of my colleagues not have a of the substitute? Okay.

So, in the interest of time, I'm going to go right, where's our Department of Planning? Oh, you're on my right side today. All right, Patrick.

Patrick Murphy is going to walk us through the highlights of the ordinance and some of the changes from yesterday's meeting. Patrick, do you want to come up?

[Speaker 1] (20:22 - 22:58)
Okay. Good morning, Chairman and members of the Committee. For the record, my name is Patrick Murphy with the Department of Planning and Development.

I'm here to discuss the proposed changes to certain sections of the Chicago Zoning Ordinance as they relate to the introduction of recreational cannabis in various forms and functionality as an allowed use in the City of Chicago. The changes detailed in this proposed substitute ordinance amendment are designed to treat recreational cannabis as a permitted or special use under specific circumstances and in non-residential and certain commercial, manufacturing, and downtown zoning districts. First, however, I'd like to point out the few changes that were made to the ordinance since it was introduced, which resulted in the substitute you have before you.

In order of appearance, the changes are as follows. One, in business, neighborhood commercial, downtown service, and limited manufacturing districts, the establishment of any cannabis operation will be precluded. Two, in business, so all of the B districts, neighborhood commercial, downtown service, and limited manufacturing districts, the establishment of any cannabis operations will be prohibited.

In planned manufacturing districts, the establishment of any cannabis production facility is subject to review and approval by the Zoning Board of Appeals as a special use. In sections 17-7, 0-5-6-1, and 0-5-6-2, the boundaries of the cannabis dispensary free zone have been revised to move the western boundary further east and the northern and southern boundaries further north. There's a map that's being distributed now that will highlight the currently proposed boundary changes.

The western boundary has moved from LaSalle to State between the main branch of the Chicago River to the south, and now to Division Street instead of Oak to the north. Also south of the main branch of the Chicago River, the southern boundary was moved from Ida B. Wells Drive to Van Buren Street.

The remainder of the boundaries are unchanged. The intent was always to include parcels on both sides of the boundary streets as being within the exclusion zone. So this revision then also removes associated verbiage that was perceived as confusing by some of the readers and potential operators as it related to boundary streets, particularly north of the main branch of the Chicago River.

[Speaker 2] (22:58 - 23:00)
We need a repeat on that one too, Patrick.

[Speaker 1] (23:01 - 23:02)
Okay, the whole thing?

[Speaker 2] (23:02 - 23:02)
No.

[Speaker 1] (23:03 - 23:30)
So it was originally drafted to always include both sides of the boundary streets. So the east and west sides of formerly LaSalle, now State, the north and south sides of formerly Oak, now Division, and the north and south sides of formerly Ida B. Wells, now Van Buren.

And so the language was adjusted in the sections I referenced to make it clear that it includes both sides of the streets.

[Speaker 2] (23:33 - 23:34)
Continue.

[Speaker 1] (23:35 - 26:26)
In section 1790129, the former cannabis ordinance as it related to medical dispensaries prohibited the presence of dwelling units in such buildings. As the State has no such explicit restrictions and as our use matrices for the various zoning districts makes clear, cannabis uses are prohibited in buildings which are otherwise exclusively residential and in residential zoning districts. So this section was seen as duplicative and is no longer necessary.

Also in section 1790129, retail sales functions are proposed to be extended via a special use to cannabis craft growers in light and heavy industry manufacturing and planned manufacturing districts under the same restricted sales terms as all other retail functions in similar zoning districts and such uses will count towards district caps. This allowance is precluded by the State from being extended to cannabis cultivation centers. Further down in section 1790129, the State of Illinois' Department of Financial and Professional Regulations asks that the City change our term from co-location to same site when discussing medical and cannabis dispensaries that operate in the same space and adjust our date reference to coincide with the State's deadlines.

This text change does not diminish or otherwise dilute the intent of this passage. It simply eliminates language that the State felt may be potentially viewed in conflict with their statute. Lastly, in section 1790129, the establishment of a cannabis business within a planned development cannot take place prior to the same such use being reviewed and needing to be approved as a special use by the ZBA.

In section 17130905, before any special use for any cannabis business establishment can be considered by the ZBA, the applicant must hold a public meeting in the ward where the project is proposed and the applicant must notify the local alderman in writing and provide public notice in the newspaper and to area property owners so the project may be discussed. Finally, in 17140301I and pursuant to the provisions of the State statute, any legally sufficient filing of a petition to restrict the establishment of a cannabis business will result in a 90-day stay of pending applications or the proceedings of filed applications before the ZBA to the degree such applications are impacted by the language or geography of the petition. With that explanation, I ask that the committee accept the substitute for purposes of today's hearing.

[Speaker 2] (26:28 - 26:47)
Alderman Riley moves to accept the substitute. All those in favor? Any opposed?

The substitute is on the table. Questions? Did we have enough questions yesterday or what?

Okay, Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 5] (26:48 - 27:08)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I'd just like to commend yourself and the administration and the mayor in particular for working with the Black Caucus on coming up with these amendments. I think it's a great compromise and we appreciate the opportunity to dialogue about this.

[Speaker 3] (27:09 - 28:44)
Thank you, Alderman Burnett. Alderman Riley. Thank you, Chairman.

I also would like to compliment the mayor and her team and you, Chairman, for all the work that's gone into this ordinance. I think it's pretty clear that at the end of this negotiating process ahead of this hearing today, no one in the room is thrilled with the ordinance and oftentimes in this building, when that occurs, it means that a relatively fair compromise has been achieved. I'll be honest, if I had it my way, this would be a far more permissive ordinance.

We would have a much bigger revenue opportunity downtown next year. But again, part of compromise is giving up things that are important to you in order to forward the ball down the field and serve the greater good. And so I know there are other opinions in this room too.

I think each of us has a slightly different opinion on cannabis. But again, I think that this process has worked well. It's my hope that all of us will honor the compromise and agreement we came to last night and do nothing to undermine that.

That would be wrong. That would be negotiating in bad faith. And so let's see how this goes.

Again, this is a living, breathing document. That's the beauty of ordinances. They can be changed.

And so I hope that we can move forward with this plan. And in the future, if there are tweaks and changes that need to be made, that's the conversation we can have with the administration. But again, thank you, Chairman, for the long hours you put into this ordinance and for getting us to this point today.

[Speaker 2] (28:45 - 29:24)
Thank you, Alderman Riley. Hearing no other comments or questions, Alderman Burnett moves do pass as amended. All those in favor?

Any opposed? I have one. Alderman Lopez on the negative on that.

With his objection, the ordinance still passes. Thank you. And we'll report it out in an hour.

This meeting is adjourned. Do I have a motion to adjourn? Moved by Alderman Rodriguez.

This is a meeting is adjourned. Thank you.
