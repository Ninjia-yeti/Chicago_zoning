[Speaker 41] (12:48 - 12:48)
Alderman Haddon.

[Speaker 1] (12:49 - 12:52)
I'm sorry. Alderman Haddon, you wish to be recognized?

[Speaker 10] (12:53 - 12:55)
Yes, please. Chairman, just want to be recognized for the roll.

[Speaker 1] (12:56 - 13:04)
You will, and for the quorum. All right, two public speakers. We'll hear from them now.

First person is Jones Richmond.

[Speaker 9] (13:14 - 13:18)
Jones Richmond, please press star six on your phone to unmute.

[Speaker 39] (13:19 - 13:24)
Star six. There you go. Hello.

This is Jones Richmond.

[Speaker 1] (13:25 - 13:30)
All right, Mr. Richmond, your public comment period begins with you, so commence.

[Speaker 39] (13:31 - 14:44)
Okay. My name is Jones Richmond. I've been a plumber for over 32 years.

I was an inspector in the city of Chicago for 12 of those years. I have installed and inspected plumbing systems over my career. This new plumbing code addresses affordable housing in the south and west side of Chicago.

It also helps single-family homes, homeowners, as well as builders that are involved in building and rehabbing mixed-use structures. While this change in the plumbing code is substantial, we feel it keeps the integrity of the plumbing system to help protect the health of the nation while addressing the affordable housing crisis in the city of Chicago. I would like to thank Chicago Building Department, Commissioner Matt O'Day, especially Marlene Hoffman, for her tireless efforts working with the mayor's office, the unions, and the experts in the plumbing industry to achieve the goal to keep the city of Chicago safe.

I would like to thank the mayor's office, the members of this committee, to allow me to speak today. Thank you. I'm done.

[Speaker 1] (14:44 - 14:52)
Thank you, Mr. Richmond, and thank you for your service to the city for these many years. Our next speaker is Deirdre Graziano.

[Speaker 9] (15:00 - 15:04)
Deirdre Graziano, please press star six on your phone to unmute.

[Speaker 30] (15:06 - 16:50)
Okay. Thank you so much. Good morning, Chicago City Council.

My name is Deirdre Graziano. Go suck. But I'm here today to talk on behalf of the Lincoln Central Association and the Lincoln Park community.

Lincoln Central Association and the Ranch Association have worked years to get to this point in history. The landmark of the Hawthorne Willow Group is a culmination of years of community effort throughout Lincoln Park. Landmark Illinoisan Preservation Chicago has stood behind us throughout these years.

We fought off the tear down of the old Chilean building, knowing once it came down, there would be a domino effect and we would lose all of the Hawthorne Willow Group. The Hawthorne Willow Group contains Victorian Romanesque and Italian-made buildings of high integrity. This collection of buildings holds many stories of Lincoln Park's immigrant history.

German and Bosnian communities found comfort in this active pedestrian commercial district. Chicago's magic history began here at Chilean, and to this day, magicians around the world pay tribute to that history. The Willow Womb building held Chicago's first Bosnian mosque in what was once a German social hall.

Our community is losing much of its city stories and its architectural history, but this collection of buildings stands tall as a gateway to the Sheffield Historic District. The buildings are loved by our community, which has spent years to finally get to this point, where preservation will secure our history and some of our important Chicago stories. Thank you in advance for your consideration of this landmarking, and we hope that you will support and vote this in.

Go again, you White Sox. Thanks again.

[Speaker 1] (16:50 - 16:54)
Thank you, Deirdre. Our next speaker is Jim Majerowicz.

[Speaker 34] (16:59 - 17:04)
Hi. Hi, Jim. How are we doing, young man?

[Speaker 1] (17:05 - 17:12)
Thank you. That'll get you a lot of gold star with me. So let's talk about the plumbing code.

I know that's what you want to talk about.

[Speaker 34] (17:13 - 18:43)
Yes, sir. All right, Tom. My name is Jim Majerowicz.

I've been involved with plumbing since 1978. I'm a lifelong city resident. I'm a member of Plumbers Local 130 with the position of training director.

I'm also a plumbing engineer, green plumbing designer. All right. So we're in our 150th anniversary of our great Chicago fire.

And I don't mean that in good terms. It's bad terms. But the good that came out of that is with the building department and changing codes in the city to noncombustible materials.

And we haven't had another fire like that because of the great work of the building department, working with noncombustible materials. This protects public safety and health by using noncombustible materials. The building department has worked with us.

And we have kept in commercial use noncombustible materials. And to continue to work with this, we'd like to see that local plumbing experts continue on to work with the building department to keep a good, strong building code to protect the public safety of the citizens and the visitors of Chicago. Thank you, committee members.

[Speaker 1] (18:44 - 19:05)
Thank you, Jim, for, again, longstanding service to the not only Lakeview community, but to the city and the plumbers union. Good luck to you. All right.

That concludes the public speaking portion of the hearing. I see, I saw Alderman Michelle's hand up. Michelle, did you have a...

[Speaker 19] (19:05 - 19:09)
Yes, thank you, Chairman. I just wanted to be recognized for the role.

[Speaker 1] (19:10 - 19:31)
Thank you very much. I know we've got an item or two on the agenda, but it'll be a little bit later in the meeting. All right.

We're going to start with the addendum to the agenda. We have one mayoral appointment. That is A-2021-158, the appointment of Carlos Pinero.

Is that right, staff?

[Speaker 37] (19:32 - 19:32)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (19:32 - 19:45)
As a member of the Chicago Planning Commission. Everyone should have received a copy of his resume electronically. And we have Mr. Pinero here, if you would like to say a few words and answer any questions. Carlos.

[Speaker 41] (19:46 - 19:46)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (19:47 - 19:47)
Great. Yeah.

[Speaker 18] (19:47 - 20:33)
Thank you, Chairman Taney and members of the committee for the opportunity to speak to you today. For the record, my name is Carlos Pinero. I'm honored to have been nominated to the Planning Commission.

I recognize the importance of the commission, the role that the commission has in the growth and economic development of the city of Chicago. As a matter of background, I have an engineering degree and a master's degree in finance. Over the last 20 years, my career has been focused in finance.

I'm currently a managing director at RBC Capital Markets in our Chicago office. And I hope to have an opportunity to work with the commission, the administration, and city council to contribute to the growth and development of the city.

[Speaker 1] (20:35 - 20:49)
Thank you. Thank you, Carlos. Do we have any questions from any members?

I see my vice chair, Alderman Raboyas. Thank you, Chairman. I, too, am in full support of Carlos Pinero.

[Speaker 31] (20:50 - 20:56)
I've known him for years. This is an excellent appointment by the mayor, and I hope my colleagues support.

[Speaker 11] (20:57 - 21:05)
He's got a wealth of information, a lot of knowledge, and we could use this in planning development. Thank you, sir. Thank you, Ariel.

[Speaker 1] (21:06 - 21:56)
Other questions? Well, Carlos, I look forward to working with you. As a member of the Planning Commission, I think you bring some unique expertise to the commission.

I know we've had a lot of architects. It's nice to have an engineer and somebody who knows how to provide the investment in the entire city, in addition to the mayor's agenda on the south and west side. Alderman, any more questions?

All right. Then, can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderman Raboyas makes that motion.

Any objections to the motion? Hearing none, the appointment is passed. Congratulations.

[Speaker 32] (21:57 - 21:58)
Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (21:58 - 22:03)
They're long meetings, by the way, just so make sure you block out your day. I've heard.

[Speaker 32] (22:03 - 22:03)
Yeah.

[Speaker 1] (22:03 - 22:29)
All right. Staying on the addendum, we have one text amendment, document number 02021-4134, Amendment of Municipal Code, Chapter 18-29, Articles 1 through 15, regarding plumbing provisions. Committee members should have received a copy of the ordinance as well as a summary of the ordinance electronically.

I think we have a one-pager, is that correct? One and a quarter.

[Speaker 41] (22:29 - 22:30)
One and a quarter.

[Speaker 1] (22:33 - 22:40)
Okay. So, let's see. We're going to have Matt Bode on this, please.

Commissioner.

[Speaker 7] (22:41 - 27:27)
Yes, Mr. Chairman. Good morning, Chairman Toney and members of the Committee on Zoning Landmarks and Building Standards. My name is Matt Bode and I'm the Commissioner for the Department of Buildings.

With me today are First Deputy Commissioner Marlene Hopkins and Managing Deputy Commissioner Grant Ulrich. I'm here today to ask for your favorable consideration for Mayor Lightfoot's ordinance making interim amendments to the plumbing-related provisions of the code. Like the interim plumbing mechanical-related amendments to the code passed last month by this Committee and Council, these interim plumbing-related provisions are intended to assist homeowners and businesses as we recover from the pandemic.

We are grateful to our partners in the industry and the trades for working with us on these interim measures and look forward to working with stakeholders to develop further ordinances to modernize the Chicago Construction Codes for your consideration in 2022. I would especially like to thank Local 130, Jim Coyne, Jim Majerowicz, and Jones Richmond for their invaluable input on these amendments and look forward to working with them in the future as well. I believe all of you received the one-page summary highlighting the major topics addressed in this ordinance.

I'd like to highlight a few of those for you this morning. First, the ordinance adopts provisions for gender-neutral restrooms. These changes help create restrooms that are more usable and welcoming, not just to transgender people, but to everybody.

For example, a parent who doesn't want to send their child into an opposite-gender restroom alone or an elderly person who needs assistance from an opposite-gender caretaker. Single-user toilet rooms, a restroom with a single toilet and sink. This ordinance updates our plumbing code consistent with recent changes in the Illinois law to require gender-neutral signage.

This ordinance clarifies that single-user toilet rooms can be used to provide required toilet facilities either in combination with or in place of a male or female multi-stall restroom. The ordinance allows all gender restrooms with multiple private stalls and shared sinks. This option includes requirements to ensure safety and privacy for all users.

These changes were developed based on the latest national model plumbing codes and extensive conversation with stakeholders such as Restroom Access Project, Equity Illinois, and the Illinois Restaurant Association, several of our large colleges and universities, and other advocates and business groups. Second, as Mr. Majerowicz and Mr. Richman mentioned, the ordinance expands the allowed use of PVC plastic drain waste and vent piping. In the current code, PVC drain pipe is limited to above-ground use entirely in residential buildings up to three stories in height.

This ordinance will allow PVC drain pipe for residential portions of buildings, including mixed-use buildings, up to 60 feet in building height, which is approximately five stories. This ordinance will also allow PVC for residential use underground. These expanded options for residential use will be a tremendous asset to homeowners seeking to stay in their homes and for multifamily residents, especially for affordable housing.

Third, this ordinance will allow small storefront businesses, including restaurants, with a capacity of 30 people or less, to provide one single-user restroom. This will help tremendously as businesses emerge from the pandemic and new businesses seek to open in your commercial quarters and neighborhoods. By reducing the amount of floor space required to be set aside for restrooms, it increases the amount of floor space that can be used for business activities.

For example, in a small restaurant, there might be room for an additional two-seat table. For larger restaurants and businesses required to provide additional restroom facilities, the gender-neutral restroom provision in this ordinance provides other alternatives to reduce floor space and use floor space to generate revenue. Fourth, this ordinance makes additional changes to bring our plumbing code up to the latest technical standards and better align with the new building code this council adopted in 2019.

This includes changes to clarify requirements for water safety, water conserving plumbing fixtures, and swimming pool designs. Finally, the Department of Buildings is pleased to work with our partner, the Department of Water Management, with permitting for lead service replacement. In 2020, the council authorized a permit fee waiver worth up to $3,100 for homeowners, voluntary replacing, and existing lead line service.

In the first year, we've had approximately 20 homeowners take advantage of the fee waiver. We hope to see many more next year and as word spreads about the program. This ordinance will expand eligibility for fee waivers to also allow non-profit entities, such as churches, to benefit from the permit fee waiver.

Thank you for your time, and I ask for your favor of consideration, and we are happy to answer any of your questions. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (27:28 - 28:02)
Thank you, Commissioner. We have questions. Obviously, we heard from the Plumber Union with their support.

I'm going to start out with a question or so, Matt. Matt, we talked about affordable housing as a real plus with this change. So, in a mixed-use facility where there's commercial on the ground floor, that has to be copper and whatever, but you said below grade, which is where the residential portion, that can all be PVC?

[Speaker 7] (28:03 - 28:22)
It can be PVC if it's an entirely residential use. So, for instance, what you mentioned is the usual storefront with the apartments above. That is the storefront itself would have to be cast iron still, and the undergrounds, which would be servicing a non-residential use, would also have to be cast iron.

[Speaker 1] (28:23 - 28:31)
But the underground servicing the residential, and I'm not a plumber, but don't you need below grade even to service the apartments?

[Speaker 7] (28:31 - 28:31)
Yeah.

[Speaker 1] (28:32 - 28:33)
And that could be PVC?

[Speaker 7] (28:33 - 28:38)
It can be if it's separated completely from the commercial use. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (28:39 - 28:39)
All right.

[Speaker 7] (28:39 - 28:44)
But if they're both using the same, then it would be cast iron. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (28:45 - 28:56)
All right. And talk to me a little bit about the drinking water and water lines. Could you restate that?

[Speaker 7] (28:57 - 29:03)
Oh, so the water lines are still copper. So, you know, PVC is only for drain and waste.

[Speaker 1] (29:04 - 29:10)
Okay. So, when you say strengthen and clarify requirements to protect drinking water.

[Speaker 7] (29:11 - 29:16)
So, I'll ask Brad Dalbert to chime in on that. There are some provisions that we made.

[Speaker 20] (29:18 - 29:45)
Yeah. So, again, it is retaining our longstanding requirement for copper piping for drinking water. Some other places allow other materials, and in consultation with industry groups and the Department of Water Management, that wasn't something we wanted to pursue here.

There is some language in our code that lines up with federal law, but it was a little unclear. There were some typos in it. So, we wanted to clean that up, bring that into line with language in the Illinois plumbing code, matching those lead-free standards in federal law.

[Speaker 1] (29:47 - 29:50)
All right. Alderman Kaplan has his hand up.

[Speaker 2] (29:51 - 30:29)
Thank you, Chairman Tunney. I just want to come out in full support of this. We all know that the cost of housing is skyrocketing.

So, anything that we can do to bring down those costs are certainly something that we should pursue. I also have a very small restaurant that really needed this gender-neutral bathroom. So, it really helped them out.

And for those of us who identify as non-binary, this is also extremely supportive of who they are, too, as well. So, all the way around, this is an incredible ordinance. Thank you so much.

[Speaker 9] (30:30 - 30:31)
Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (30:32 - 30:37)
Thank you, Alderman. I don't see other hands up.

[Speaker 9] (30:39 - 30:39)
Okay.

[Speaker 7] (30:39 - 30:50)
So, sorry, Chairman. I'd also really need to recognize Marlene Hopkins and Frank Allert for their work on this and getting this entire package put together.

[Speaker 1] (30:52 - 31:07)
Thank you to your team. Just off the record, we have a new, hopefully we'll have a new Midwest administrator on the EPA that might be working very closely with the building code and water issues. Deborah Shore.

[Speaker 41] (31:07 - 31:09)
Looking forward to it.

[Speaker 1] (31:09 - 31:10)
I'm more excited about that.

[Speaker 41] (31:10 - 31:11)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (31:12 - 31:22)
All right. Other further questions by committee members? There are no questions.

Do I hear a motion to move to pass by the same roll call those used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 41] (31:23 - 31:23)
So moved.

[Speaker 1] (31:24 - 32:06)
Seconded by Alderman Capelman. Alderman Capelman makes the motion. Any objections to his motion?

Hearing none, the item is passed. Moving on. We have three historical landmark designations on the addendum today.

First up, 02021-3928. In the fourth ward, the historical landmark designation for the Muddy Waters House, located at 4339 South Lake Park Avenue. We have Candalyn Hunt here from the Historic Preservation of the Department of Planning and Development to present this matter.

Ms. Hunt.

[Speaker 3] (32:12 - 32:14)
How about that? Can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (32:14 - 32:15)
We're ready.

[Speaker 3] (32:16 - 35:22)
Okay, great. So the two flat at 4339 South Lake Park Avenue was built in 1891 and served as the home of blues musician Muddy Waters from 1954 to 1973. The hospitality extended to Chicago musicians and musicians who came to record or perform in the city made the home an unofficial center for the Chicago blues community.

The home is located in the fourth ward in the Kenwood community area. In the early 1950s, this meant that it was close to the city's concentration of record distributors and independent record companies like Chess Records, as well as the blues clubs of the South Side, making it a natural gathering place for other blues musicians. Waters, born in rural Mississippi, had come to Chicago in 1947 during the Great Migration like millions of other African Americans who left their homes to flee the Jim Crow South and to find better opportunities in the urban centers of the Midwest, West, and Northeastern U.S. Considered by many to be the father of Chicago blues, Waters skillfully married the raw, acoustic Delta blues of Mississippi with amplification to create a powerful new urban sound that could be heard in the loudest of Chicago's nightclubs and which would send the heartbeat of America's culture around the world. Waters recorded with Chicago's Chess Records from 1947 through 1975. This work produced 16 Billboard R&B hit singles and two of Waters' six Billboard Top 200 albums.

Throughout this time, he was a fixture of Chicago's blues scenes, holding residencies with his band at clubs around the city. It was during these same years that Muddy Waters offered hospitality out of 4339 South Lake Park Avenue, pictured here. Musicians were welcomed at all hours.

Not only food and drink, but lodging was also offered to traveling musicians like Howlin' Wolf and Chuck Berry. Band members including Otis Spann and James Cotton lived in second floor apartments. Rehearsals were held in the basement and would spill outside to the yard on warm days.

The music of Waters and other Chicago blues masters first made the charts with their African American audience, but this audience would diversify and expand across the Atlantic by the late 50s and 60s. Picked up by young performers, their blues influenced the sound of rock and roll as it emerged as acknowledged by rock legends like Chuck Berry, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, and countless others. Waters' music won six Grammys and he was posthumously awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

The story of Muddy Waters informs us of the history of the nation at large, and Chicago in particular, in the latter half of the 20th century. Chicago shaped his music and he made Chicago synonymous with the blues. Waters' home at 4339 South Lake Park was at the center of this cultural shift.

The current owner of the home, Muddy Waters' great granddaughter, Chandra Cooper, has requested this designation, and she is with us today if you have any questions for her. Alderman Sophia King has provided a letter of support. On behalf of the Commission on Chicago Landmarks, we request your favorable consideration of this individual landmark designation.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (35:29 - 35:33)
Are we having Prentice Butler from the Fourth Ward speak on this?

[Speaker 26] (35:34 - 35:37)
Chairman Alderman King will be on just a moment of speech.

[Speaker 1] (35:38 - 35:43)
Okay. We'd rather hear from the Alderman. Nothing personal.

[Speaker 28] (35:43 - 35:44)
I understand.

[Speaker 1] (35:49 - 35:53)
Okay. Alderman King, you're on, on the Muddy Waters.

[Speaker 10] (35:53 - 37:39)
Hi, Chairman. You guys had me in the waiting room. I was listening, though.

Okay. I've been there for the last 10 minutes, but no, thank you. I am honored to be here today to speak on behalf of the Muddy Waters Museum in North Kenwood, Oakland.

This is something, you know, that we've been talking about for some time now, and I'm happy to add to the accolades for this particular museum. I think that due to the history that Muddy Waters has provided all of the—excuse me one quick second. Let me turn this off.

I'm sorry. That Muddy Waters, you know, has been a huge contributor to the blues, to rock and roll, and that having this particular, his particular home landmarked here in the city of Chicago would also be not only, you know, something that recognizes his contributions, but will also recognize the contributions of the blues to Chicago. And so, you know, I wholeheartedly recommend this and ask my colleagues to approve landmark status for the Muddy Waters Museum.

[Speaker 1] (37:41 - 37:55)
Questions for the department or the alderwoman? I do not see hands up. Alderman Riley, do you wish to be recognized for the quorum, or do you want to speak on the museum?

[Speaker 32] (37:56 - 38:02)
Just want to be recognized for quorum.

[Speaker 1] (38:02 - 38:04)
Okay, so you recognize for quorum.

[Speaker 8] (38:05 - 38:06)
Just want to be recognized for quorum. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (38:07 - 38:09)
Thank you. Alderman Dowell.

[Speaker 37] (38:12 - 39:01)
Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just wanted to congratulate my colleague, Alderman King, for moving forward with this designation and to thank Candlin for her work.

But this is a very important designation within the Bronzeville community, and I know Alderman King has been working on this for some time. The community really looks forward to this. 43rd Street was a blues district back in the day, where the Checkerboard Lounge was also located, where Muddy Waters played with Mick Jagger and others.

So, just wanted to congratulate the alderman. This is a significant accomplishment. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (39:03 - 39:27)
Thank you, Alderman Dowell. And Alderman Sophia King. I just want to chime in.

Alderman Dowell, if you remember correctly, I think you and I met about the Bronzeville Entertainment District when neither of us were aldermen. So, it goes way back, if I'm not mistaken, when you were with the Department of Planning and I was on the Economic Development Commission. Is that correct, Pat?

[Speaker 37] (39:28 - 39:37)
That's accurate. We've been trying to uplift our history in that community for a very long time. So, it's great to see Alderman King take it to the finish line.

[Speaker 1] (39:38 - 40:22)
Yep. Thank you, Alderwoman King. And I don't see any hands up, so Alderman Dowell moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections to her motion? Hearing none, the item is passed. Thank you both.

Thank you. Next is document number 02021-3830 in the 11th Ward. The historical landmark designation for the Monastery of the Holy Cross Building, located at 3101-3111 South Aberdeen Street.

Again, we have Ms. Hahn from the Historic Preservation Division of the Department of Planning and Development to present this matter. Handle it.

[Speaker 3] (40:22 - 42:08)
Thank you. Again, Chairman Tunney. Staff, we are here today with a proposed ordinance for the landmark designation of the Monastery of the Holy Cross, formerly the Immaculate Conception Catholic Church.

The monastery is a significant neighborhood religious complex that served the Bridgeport community area since 1909. It has served Bridgeport community area since 1909. It was built by the German Catholic Parish and served as a church until 1990.

In 1991, it became the home of the Monastery of the Holy Cross, a Roman Catholic Benedictine monastery. In 2018, Father Peter Funk of the monastery requested landmark designation. The Monastery of the Holy Cross is located on Chicago's near southwest side in the 11th Ward.

The church and adjoining rectory building, here shown in black, are at the southeast corner of Aberdeen and 31st Street. In August of 2021, the Commission on Chicago Landmarks found that the building, which consists of this original church structure and adjoining rectory, met three criteria for designation, including those for heritage, architecture, and architect. Alderman Patrick Thompson has expressed his support of the proposed designation.

The monastery has consented to the designation, and I know that Father Peter Funk was hoping to join this morning. Finally, DPD would like to thank Preservation Chicago, who contributed significantly to the report. On behalf of the Commission on Chicago Landmarks, the Department of Planning and Development respectfully requests your consideration of the proposed designation of Landmark Designation of the Monastery of the Holy Cross.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (42:09 - 42:20)
Thank you, Anne Boleyn. I'm not sure we have Peter from the monastery on the call.

[Speaker 11] (42:20 - 42:21)
No?

[Speaker 3] (42:25 - 42:30)
Okay. I know he had wanted to join and I had sent an email. I didn't know if he was able to join.

[Speaker 1] (42:31 - 42:41)
We don't have him, so... Apologies. No problem.

It was an interesting report. Now, you have the rectory and the church.

[Speaker 41] (42:41 - 42:42)
Yes, that's correct.

[Speaker 1] (42:42 - 42:54)
The monastery is being used by both? Is it a residence on both? I mean, obviously the rectory was a residence.

[Speaker 3] (42:55 - 43:25)
Yes, it is in current use. They have a small... I don't know if you can see my arrow here, but they own the property along here.

It includes a vacant lot, a non-historic building, etc. And the monastery is open to the public. In fact, I've been told that they even have a B&B in case you wanted to stay in Bridgeport.

They have a room available in both the rectory and, I believe, in the main building, the church building as well.

[Speaker 1] (43:27 - 43:34)
Well, that would be an interesting experience. But they also own that one non-contributing building on the map?

[Speaker 3] (43:35 - 43:36)
Yes, that's correct.

[Speaker 1] (43:36 - 43:42)
And there's no redevelopment plan sustained the way it is?

[Speaker 3] (43:42 - 43:43)
No, there are no plans currently.

[Speaker 1] (43:45 - 43:46)
All right.

[Speaker 3] (43:47 - 43:47)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (43:48 - 43:51)
Gil, Alderman Villegas has his hand up.

[Speaker 9] (43:51 - 43:56)
Gil? Chairman, thank you. I just wanted to be recognized for quorum.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (43:56 - 45:19)
Yes, sir. All right. Sounds like a great project.

Obviously, 100 years of serving, more than 110 serving the community in some religious capacity. So, I don't have any more questions. Do we have a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

So moved by Alderman Cardona. Alderman Cardona makes the motion. Any objections to his motion?

No objections. The item is passed. Thank you.

All right. Now we are on item number 02021-3581 in the 43rd and 2nd wards. The historical landmark designation for the Halstead-Willow Group of four buildings located at 1800 North Halstead, 1732 North Halstead, 17-27 through 29 North Halstead, and 1733 North Halstead.

Again, we have Ms. Hahn here from the Historic Preservation of the Department of Planning and Development to present the matter. We had a public speaker, number two, I think her name was Deirdre, in support of this. I know we have the Alderman persons on the call.

This is a very famous intersection of Halstead-Willow. Ms. Hahn, would you present?

[Speaker 3] (45:20 - 46:53)
Yes, thank you very much. So the Department of Planning and Development, on behalf of the Commission of Chicago Landmarks, has submitted a landmark designation ordinance for the Halstead-Willow Group of four buildings located, as you heard, at approximately 1800 North Halstead Street. The subject buildings are located in the southwestern portion of Lincoln Park at North Halstead and Willow, shown here with the red star.

The group of buildings are outlined in red in the map at the upper right. At the northwest corner is 1800 North Halstead, at the southwest corner is 1732 North Halstead, and side by side on the southeast corner are 1733 and 1727 to 29 North Halstead. These buildings date from the 1880s and were built with ground floor commercial space and upper floors for residential use.

Their outstanding integrity and proximity create a rare grouping that have denoted this highly localized note of activity for nearly 140 years. This proposed landmark designation has been a community driven effort of several years, involving Lincoln Central Association, Ranch Triangle Association, Landmarks Illinois, and countless other individual residents and stakeholders. Alderman Smith and Alderman Hopkins are both in support of this designation, and the Commission on Chicago Landmarks found that the structures meet the heritage, architecture, and thematic criteria for designation, and have recommended to City Council that they be designated Chicago Landmarks.

Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (46:58 - 47:07)
Thank you, Miss Han. I will start with our committee member, Alderman Hopkins, would you like to speak before we hear from Alderwoman Michelle Smith.

[Speaker 20] (47:09 - 48:29)
I would, Mr. Chairman, thank you. This is a culmination of a very long effort. It wasn't easy, but I think we all agree it is worth it to finally get this across the finish line.

This is just a remarkable culmination of a community-led effort, predates my taking office as Alderman. I became aware of this before I even assumed this office. The accolades go to the Neighborhood Association, Lincoln Central, and the others that were involved in this, just did an outstanding job.

These buildings are so worth saving. It is such an important part of the history of the North Side of Chicago. As a matter of fact, I'm having a birthday party for my child turning six, and we've hired a magician.

When he found out that I was part of the effort to landmark the building, boy, the stories that I heard. It is well known in the community of magic performers, and it's such a great part of our history, and such a feel-good story all around. Congratulations to everyone, and to my colleague, Alderman Smith, who's been instrumental in this.

She has about 75% of it. I just have about 25% of it. Nevertheless, my support is 100% behind everyone.

Congratulations all, and a job well done.

[Speaker 1] (48:29 - 48:32)
Thank you, Alderman. Alderman Michelle Smith.

[Speaker 19] (48:34 - 49:56)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for your statement that this is a famous corner. Sure, it is a famous corner. It was originally set aside.

Several of these buildings were saved by Arthur Rublev himself, in beginning to do some of the redevelopment of Lincoln Park that occurred in the late 60s and early 70s, and throughout the 80s. They were saved because people have always recognized that one of the hallmarks of the Lincoln Park community is its historic structures. The fact that the buildings on these corners have been preserved up until this time, it really is the gateway to this part of Lincoln Park.

I want to recognize the incredible effort. I've been working on this since 2013, and other people in the community have really been working on it even longer. I really want to thank our speaker today, Deirdre Graziano herself, who's a member of that mighty band, as well as several others from our community.

It wouldn't have happened without the incredible hard work of Landmarks Illinois, the late, great Terry Tatum, who helped us, and so many people in the community. We're so proud and would like to ask everyone's support. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (49:56 - 50:26)
Thank you, Alder Persons, both of you, on this preservation effort and for the department. Any questions, comments? All right, I don't see hands up.

Alderman Hopkins makes the motion to move due pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to his motion? All right, hearing none, the item is passed.

Congratulations to all.

[Speaker 11] (50:26 - 50:27)
Thank you, everyone.

[Speaker 1] (50:28 - 52:19)
All right, moving on, we have one request for a fee waiver for a historical landmark property in the 4th Ward, located at 523 through 529 South Plymouth Court. Do I hear a motion to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum on the fee waiver? Alderman Hopkins makes the motion to move due pass.

Any objections? The item is passed. Hearing none.

All right, now we're moving on to large signs over 100 square feet in area, 24 feet above grade. We will hear them all together. I'll read the word followed by the address and take a motion at the end.

Two signs in the 4th Ward, located at 4720 South Cottage Grove Avenue. One sign in the 8th Ward, located at 9241 South Stony Island. One sign in the 11th Ward, located at 3000 South Halstead.

One sign in the 22nd Ward, located at 3501 South Pulaski. One sign in the 27th Ward, located at 100 South Halstead. One sign in the 28th Ward, located at 2551 West Cermak Road.

One sign in the 38th Ward, located at 5333 West Irving Park Road. And one sign in the 41st Ward at 7220 West Foster Avenue. Two signs in the 42nd Ward at 444 North Wabash Avenue.

And one sign in the 44th Ward at 2844 North Broadway. Lastly, two signs in the 45th Ward, located at 4211 North Cicero Avenue. Any questions by committee members?

We have a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

[Speaker 16] (52:22 - 52:23)
Moved to pass, Alderman Wagesbeck.

[Speaker 1] (52:23 - 52:46)
Alderman Wagesbeck makes the motion move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to the motion? Hearing none, these orders are passed.

Okay, Alderman Osterman, do you wish to be recognized for the quorum?

[Speaker 26] (52:47 - 52:48)
Please, add me to the quorum.

[Speaker 1] (52:49 - 53:11)
Thank you, Harry. All right, now we'll move on to the regular agenda in an effort to minimize technical difficulties and to ensure the committee meeting runs as smoothly as possible. The typical order in which items will be heard has been updated.

Throughout the duration of virtual committee and zoning meetings, items will be grouped together according to witness, attorney, and will be heard in that order rather than the typical ward order.

[Speaker 29] (53:11 - 53:19)
We don't have Alderman Irvin or Alderman Garza on, so let's go to Alderman Garza.

[Speaker 1] (53:19 - 53:50)
Okay, so we're on page one. All right, so we do not, in attendance at this time, we do not have Alderman Susan Sedlowski-Garza, and we do not have Alderman Burnett, or we do have Burnett, but we don't have Irvin, who's the lead on the second aldermanic. We will reach, once they get on, we will go back to them.

But now we are on the bottom of page- Nine.

[Speaker 41] (53:50 - 53:51)
Nine.

[Speaker 1] (53:51 - 54:34)
Pardon me. I'm sorry. We're going to move out of the order, take care of item in Alderman Cardenas' ward.

That's document, bottom of page nine, folks. Document number 20829-T1-12th Ward. Ordinance was referred on September 14th of 21.

Common address is 3900 Southwestern Avenue. Change request B31, Community Shopping District, to C21, Motor Vehicle-Related Commercial District. Amy Kersen, from Reyes Kersen.

Amy, would you like to present this? Amy, the floor is yours.

[Speaker 22] (54:39 - 54:48)
Hi. Good morning, Chairman. Thank you so much.

I apologize for the delay. Thank you to the panel, and especially to Alderman Irvin and Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 1] (54:50 - 55:03)
Amy, we're not on that item because Alderman Irvin is not on the call. We are in the 12th Ward, document number 20829-T1, Alderman Cardenas. Oh, I'm so sorry.

3900 Southwestern.

[Speaker 22] (55:04 - 55:46)
Thank you, Chairman. In this case, we very much appreciate that Alderman Cardenas has endorsed changing the zoning of this property from a B3 to a C2 to assist enterprise rent-a-truck in establishing a truck rental facility. Their plan is to rent trucks on a business-to-business basis to support small businesses that are in the general area, including in the stockyards, PMD.

It's necessary to have the C2 zoning to allow the rental of both box trucks and delivery vans because they're in different weight classifications. So this is simply to establish a truck rental company.

[Speaker 1] (55:52 - 56:00)
Alderman Cardenas, on the Southwestern application, please. Do we have a letter?

[Speaker 22] (56:02 - 56:07)
I believe that he did submit a letter of support, Chairman, in August.

[Speaker 9] (56:07 - 57:06)
All right. Sorry about that. I just got your – I'm multitasking.

All right. Well, you're on on 3900 Southwestern. Well, thank you, Chairman.

This is a property that's currently abandoned and useless to the community. We'd like to repurpose it so that enterprise can avail themselves to the community. It's changing.

This is targeting a lot of the industrial phase that's kind of being revived there in the southwest sector, and we are welcoming them to the community in McKinley Park, Bryant Park. And so I wholeheartedly am in favor of this rezoning to accommodate their request so they can lease out a larger box of a rental that they like to put out. And so that's the purpose of the rezoning.

[Speaker 41] (57:07 - 57:07)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (57:09 - 57:16)
All right. So we have questions for the attorney or the alderman on the expansion of an existing use, right, Alderman Cardenas?

[Speaker 41] (57:17 - 57:17)
Correct.

[Speaker 1] (57:18 - 57:32)
All right. All right. No questions by committee members.

Do I hear a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used in Chairman Quorum? Hands up. Who is that?

Alderman Ray Lopez? Yeah.

[Speaker 31] (57:32 - 57:33)
Hands up.

[Speaker 1] (57:33 - 57:36)
All right. Alderman Lopez moves to pass. Any objections?

[Speaker 31] (57:36 - 57:37)
No, no, no.

[Speaker 1] (57:37 - 57:41)
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Raymond, Alderman Lopez has a question.

[Speaker 31] (57:42 - 57:50)
Thank you, Chairman. Appreciate that. Is this the nightclub property on the corner of 39th and Western?

[Speaker 9] (57:54 - 57:54)
That is correct.

[Speaker 31] (57:56 - 58:21)
So I'm familiar, very familiar with this intersection. It's three blocks from my house. Where's the traffic going?

Because that's a very difficult intersection, particularly under that viaduct with all of the cross traffic on Western.

[Speaker 9] (58:21 - 58:47)
I can answer that, Chairman, or the attorney can answer that. There's two exits and entrances on Pershing. There's an entrance and exit on Pershing as well as Western Avenue.

So, you know, there's that option for trucks to exit on Western Avenue, which is the proper instead of clogging Pershing, which is, you know, for the most part, intense when it comes to east-west traffic.

[Speaker 31] (58:49 - 58:52)
So the exit will be just south of the bus stop?

[Speaker 9] (58:55 - 59:08)
I believe there's an exit. I believe that the folks here, like I said, the attorneys can add to that. I had proposed an exit up on Western as well, so that traffic could be eased on the Pershing side.

[Speaker 22] (59:10 - 59:12)
Yes, that's correct. Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 31] (59:14 - 59:17)
So traffic on to Western will be north-south directional?

[Speaker 22] (59:18 - 59:20)
It'll be on to Western Avenue, Alderman.

[Speaker 31] (59:22 - 59:25)
In which direction? Both? North and south?

[Speaker 22] (59:26 - 59:34)
I believe at that location, there's a divider that would require the traffic to turn right. Just bear with me one moment.

[Speaker 9] (59:36 - 59:43)
That would make sense. Turning right, you've got to flow into traffic on Western Avenue, as those lanes are southbound.

[Speaker 1] (59:51 - 59:58)
So, Raymond, you're familiar with the intersection. The attorney says there's a median that might prevent them going north and just southbound only?

[Speaker 31] (59:59 - 1:00:05)
I know what I heard, Chairman, and I'm waiting for the clarification, because I know it would make sense that they only go.

[Speaker 22] (1:00:06 - 1:00:08)
Bear with me, Alderman. I'll pull it up and show you.

[Speaker 9] (1:00:10 - 1:00:22)
It's a four-lane. One lane is eastbound, and southbound, and the other lane is northbound. So the natural flow of that is for trucks to go southbound on Western Avenue.

[Speaker 22] (1:00:23 - 1:00:39)
Alderman Lopez, the plan, which I'm trying to show here on screen, is that trucks would be able to enter and exit on both Western and Pershing. We're happy to come by and talk with you about the structure of the site plan, if you find that helpful.

[Speaker 31] (1:00:40 - 1:01:18)
Well, my concern, Chairman, is that I know that that is a very tight intersection. It's a very busy intersection. And unless there is a traffic study that we're not privy to or discussing, all of that extra traffic coming out onto Western, which even though you say it's supposed to go – it should go south, but if it's not required to go south, that means they're 50 feet from the intersection trying to cut in front of everybody.

[Speaker 9] (1:01:18 - 1:01:52)
Well, this is not a distribution center. It's a truck depot. It's a small box depot for basically rentals that are going to be accommodating the extra demand that's on the southwest sector.

But it is not a distribution where hundreds of trucks will be going onto the street every minute. It is going to be intermittent. If people rent the vehicle, they're going to go pick it up.

They could also end up picking up at another site. But we're not talking about hundreds of vehicles here, maybe a few a day, maybe 10 a day or something like that.

[Speaker 22] (1:01:53 - 1:02:34)
Yes, that's correct. Thank you, Alderman Cardenas. The anticipated rental levels are going to be relatively modest.

We're expecting no more than, I think, 40 rentals even on a busy day. Also, Alderman Lopez, I'd like to point out that the plan here is for the rental company will be leasing out a lot of cargo vans and commercial vans. So those are relatively small vehicles that somebody can drive without a commercial driver's license.

So we don't want to give you the impression that this is a location where a lot of semi-trucks are going to be used. This is really a business-to-business.

[Speaker 31] (1:02:35 - 1:02:47)
I know what a box truck is. I know what a cargo van is. I just also know that that's a lot of activity for a very tight corner that you can't afford it because it's not engineered correctly.

[Speaker 9] (1:02:47 - 1:04:02)
Thank you, Alderman Lopez. Yes, there's also Kirk Tires just south of this particular property, I think within a block and a half away on Western Boulevard. And that accommodates also very, very smoothly onto traffic from Western Avenue.

And it's very similar. In fact, this site is a lot less intrusive than Kirk Tires would be just north of this particular site. So I'm aware of the area.

I've been here almost 20 years, and believe me, this is a very acceptable use, not only acceptable, but it's needed to accommodate folks that are also now making their living moving different commodities in this growing sector, as I keep saying that. So it is for the local economy. It is a site that is, if you go look at it, it's dilapidated.

People go in there and relieve themselves. It is a disaster that needs to be cleaned up, and this does a great, great benefit to the community. So I thank everybody on the committee for supporting it.

Love you all. Bye. All right.

Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:04 - 1:04:18)
Enough discussion on that intersection. I'm sure traffic or CDOT will be helping Alderman Cardenas and Alderman Lopez on this congestion issue. Alderman David Moore has his hand up.

David?

[Speaker 9] (1:04:20 - 1:04:23)
Thank you, Chairman. I just wanted to be kind of in the quorum.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:24 - 1:04:30)
Okay. Thank you, Alderman Moore. Other questions, comments?

[Speaker 31] (1:04:31 - 1:04:34)
Chairman, I wish to be recognized as voting no against this item.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:34 - 1:04:53)
Okay. Well, let me get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call to establish quorum with Alderman Ray Lopez. Cardenas moves.

Do pass. Cardenas, George, you're not a member of the committee, I don't think. That's right.

Sorry about that. All right. Do I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 41] (1:04:53 - 1:04:54)
Moved by Alderman David Moore.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:54 - 1:05:13)
Alderman David Moore makes the motion with the note that Alderman Ray Lopez will be voting no on this item. Any other comments on the motion? Hearing no other, the item is passed with the recognition of one no vote on it.

[Speaker 30] (1:05:13 - 1:05:15)
I'm going to stay out of order.

[Speaker 1] (1:05:15 - 1:05:19)
Okay. Thank you. We're going to move out of order.

Now, who are we doing now?

[Speaker 12] (1:05:20 - 1:05:20)
Yelling Piper.

[Speaker 1] (1:05:23 - 1:05:30)
All right. All right. We are going to make an exception on this.

This is the medical center?

[Speaker 22] (1:05:31 - 1:05:33)
Nope. This is...

[Speaker 1] (1:05:33 - 1:06:05)
Okay. Folks, committee members, out of order, moving to page 17. Document number 20631, 27th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on February 24th of 21. Common address 160 North Morgan through 180 North Morgan. Change request.

C12 neighborhood commercial district to do a DX7, downtown mixed-use district, then to residential business plan development. We have Rich Clowder testifying. Rich?

[Speaker 23] (1:06:05 - 1:07:04)
I'm here, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for the record. Rich Clowder from DLA Piper, along with my colleague, Katie Jenke Dale.

We represent an affiliate controlled by Sterling Bay, Chicago-based developer. And the request is to rezone the property to residential business plan development with the underlying DX7 that you just mentioned for the property at 160 North Morgan. This would facilitate the construction of a residential tower of approximately 29 stories and a height of approximately 350 feet, with 282 units, 2800 square feet of ground floor commercial space, and 89 parking spaces.

A second sub area in the PD at 180 North Morgan is currently improved with a Federales restaurant and is not affected by this application. I should note that this PD was considered and recommended for approval by the Chicago Plan Commission on September 16th, 2021. And if I could, I'd like to request that the transcript and exhibits from that proceeding and the resolution adopted at that time be incorporated into the record here today.

[Speaker 1] (1:07:06 - 1:07:16)
Alderman Cardona moves to incorporate the records from the Plan Commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the records are incorporated.

Continue.

[Speaker 23] (1:07:17 - 1:08:27)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As I mentioned, the project is located at 160 North Morgan. The project did receive extensive community review and the ultimate design evolved in response both to community feedback and Department of Planning and Development review.

The developer is providing 28 affordable units on site and making a directed fee and repayment of over $5 million to facilitate a mixed income residential project located at 2548 South Federal. That's being developed by a developer by the name of AJ Patton under the name of SL Solar Lofts, and it will help forge community partnerships with minority and women-owned tradespeople and professionals. The developer at 160 North Morgan is also paying nearly $2 million into the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund to provide dollars for projects in underserved neighborhoods throughout the city as well as in the 27th Ward.

I would like to quickly thank Alderman Burnett and DPD for their thorough and thoughtful review. We appreciate your time and consideration of this project, and I and members of the development team are available should you have any questions. Otherwise, we respectfully request that you recommend to the City Council approval of the PD application and go Sox.

[Speaker 1] (1:08:28 - 1:08:36)
All right. Thank you, Rich. Alderman Burnett on this item in the 27th.

[Speaker 35] (1:08:37 - 1:09:04)
Yeah, so we're fine with it. They went to the three local community organizations in the ward. They took in all of their concerns and challenges and revised the plans.

And then we also had a community meeting with the West Loopgate and all of those organizations. And the majority of the folks in those meetings did not have a problem with the development. So we ask for the committee's support on this.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:09:06 - 1:09:11)
Thank you, Alderman Burnett. All right. Alderman David Moore, question?

[Speaker 9] (1:09:13 - 1:09:25)
Not a question, Chairman. Just wanted to say that I'm definitely in support of this. I know this project, you know, we did money that capital.

[Speaker 1] (1:09:30 - 1:09:39)
David, it sounds like you're in support of this. You were breaking up. Was there a constructive comment on this?

Other than your support?

[Speaker 9] (1:09:39 - 1:09:40)
Okay. Can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (1:09:41 - 1:09:42)
I can hear you now.

[Speaker 9] (1:09:42 - 1:10:13)
Okay, I'm sorry. And I was just saying, it's usually when we have projects like this. Yes, we get NOF money for it, but it's even better when we have developers like AJ Penn with 548 Capital, who's doing development and not only over up north, but he's doing development out south.

And that's what it's supposed to be about. So I definitely stand in approval of this project and ask for a pass to motion on this.

[Speaker 1] (1:10:13 - 1:10:35)
You'll make the motion. Okay, I will. I will entertain that in just a second if I don't see any other hands up.

I don't. So then Alderman David Moore makes the motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Objections to his motion.

Hearing none, the item is passed as revised.

[Speaker 9] (1:10:36 - 1:10:38)
Thank you very much. All right. Thank you.

[Speaker 11] (1:10:39 - 1:10:43)

We have attorney Nick potatoes.

Nick.

[Speaker 13] (1:13:45 - 1:15:05)
Morning chairman Nick to take us from the losses of Sam banks for the record. I am here on behalf of the applicant North 19 LLC. The applicant is proposing a zoning amendment type one transit oriented development zoning amendment from the underlining see one three to see one three, in order to permit an adaptive reuse program of the existing building.

We are proposing to retain retail space on the first floor, and a total of nine residential units above the subject property is transit oriented development based on its proximity to the CTA station at Damon Avenue. So no new onsite parking would be provided. I'd also point out that this is a historic building.

I'm sorry contributing building within the historic district. And we've worked at length with the wicker park committee, along with alderman Hopkins office to find a development program that everybody was comfortable with, we do have a letter of support on file. Although I do realize alderman Hopkins is present.

And before I turn the floor back over, I would ask that and amended. I'm sorry a substitute narrative and plan set the incorporated. We worked with DPD resolving an issue regarding the proposed floor area total and I want to make sure that the correct ordinance and narrative are considered.

[Speaker 1] (1:15:11 - 1:15:30)
Alderman Hopkins moves to accept the substantive narrative plans for the type one application by the same roll call to determine quorum. Any objections to the motion. Hearing on the substitute is accepted.

So, with no more testimony from Nick, let's hear from alderman Hopkins.

[Speaker 20] (1:15:31 - 1:15:38)
Thank you, Mr Chairman, really nothing to add to a council said there's no objections to this and I would ask my colleagues to support it move to pass.

[Speaker 1] (1:15:39 - 1:15:58)
Questions for the attorney, or the alderman. Hearing on can I get a motion to move to pass by the same role call that was used to determine quorum. Make your motion.

Any objections to his motion. I'm sorry.

[Speaker 16] (1:16:00 - 1:16:03)
Nothing chairman I thought alderman Hopkins had made the motion right but that's all right.

[Speaker 1] (1:16:04 - 1:16:47)
Thank you know he accepted the substitute. All right. All been walked back makes the motion.

Any objections to all been walked back to motion hearing on the item is passed with the substantive narrative and plans. Thank you all. Moving on.

Page three document number 20843 in the 47th Ward ordinance was referred on September 14 of 2021. This common address 3830 North Ashland Avenue, and the change request be free to community shopping district to RM 4.5 residential multi unit district. Nick fatigues.

[Speaker 13] (1:16:48 - 1:17:01)
Again, Sherman Nick to take us for the record, I'm here on behalf of the applicant and property owner. EP 3826 to 30 Ashland LLC. In this case, Chairman, speak up Nick.

[Speaker 41] (1:17:01 - 1:17:02)
I'm sorry.

[Speaker 13] (1:17:03 - 1:17:31)
Change allows us to do is it actually brings us into eligibility for the new additional dwelling unit ordinance program, and in this case the principal building will remain. And what's being proposed as a coach house unit above a newly constructed garage at the rear of the property. We've worked with Alderman Matt Martin, and the local community organization, as well as the 47th Ward Zach, and we believe there's a letter of support already on file for this program.

[Speaker 1] (1:17:32 - 1:17:41)
Okay, Nick, we do have a letter of support from all been Martin based on a covenant for the record. What is the nature of the problem.

[Speaker 13] (1:17:41 - 1:18:02)
Yeah, so the, the property currently has a two car garage at the rear, and there are two leased parking spaces in that garage. So we've agreed not to begin construction on the new coach house until those leases expire. And that was referenced both in a letter from my office to the alderman, as well as in the alderman's letter of support for the proposed zoning change.

[Speaker 1] (1:18:03 - 1:18:04)
All right.

[Speaker 12] (1:18:04 - 1:18:11)
So, this item didn't have a letter of opposition everyone received in the packets and this agreement. Now, boy.

[Speaker 1] (1:18:12 - 1:18:32)
Okay. Okay, so there was in the packet committee members, there was a letter of objection, based on the lease. Now that has been cured, the covenant so presumption is that that letter of objection is mute at this point.

Okay. Is that correct Nick.

[Speaker 13] (1:18:32 - 1:18:39)
Exactly correct and that's exactly why it was referenced in both the letter from my office as well as the alderman's letter to the committee.

[Speaker 1] (1:18:39 - 1:18:51)
Okay, with that. Any questions from committee members hearing on gay, can I get a motion to move to. Oh, I'm sorry.

All the men down. Yeah.

[Speaker 37] (1:18:52 - 1:19:02)
Yeah, just a chairman wanted to ask Nick, if there is an affordable housing requirement on does one of the units have to be I think you said two units.

[Speaker 13] (1:19:02 - 1:19:19)
No, there are two, two parking spaces I'm sorry alderman if I, if you misunderstood or if I miss misrepresented that we're proposing one coach house unit but maintaining two units of parking or two parking spaces. So this does not, this does not trigger legal or technical affordable unit.

[Speaker 37] (1:19:19 - 1:19:22)
All right. All right.

[Speaker 1] (1:19:23 - 1:20:00)
Okay, so all the men down makes emotion move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to her motion. Hearing none, the item is passed.

Now we're moving to the middle of page three document number 20842 again in the 47th Ward ordinance was referred on September 14 of 2021 common address is right adjacent to the previous one at 3826 North Ashland Avenue change request be three to community shopping district to an arm 4.5 residential multi unit district.

[Speaker 13] (1:20:01 - 1:20:48)
Again, we have Nick fatigues and determine that fatigue is for the record. And this is a nearly identical case to the previous case, we're proposing a zoning change to bring the property into compliance or eligibility with the additional dwelling unit ordinance so that we can build a coach house at the rear, there would be one residential unit in the coach house, and the design retains to Austrian parking spaces which are currently being would be replaced with this development.

We've worked with the alderman's office as well as the zoning advisory committee, and the local community organization. We believe there's a letter of support on file and in this case as well. We've agreed not to begin construction until the expiration of the parking lease in May of 2022.

Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:20:51 - 1:20:58)
Questions that again identical situation. Any questions from committee members.

[Speaker 37] (1:20:59 - 1:21:00)
Move to pass.

[Speaker 1] (1:21:01 - 1:21:16)
All right, hearing no more questions Alderman Pat doll moves moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to her motion. Hearing none, the item is passed.

Thank you. So is that.

[Speaker 13] (1:21:17 - 1:21:24)
I'm going to turn the floor over turn that my computer over to Sarah, so we can stay promoted so just give us one second.

[Speaker 37] (1:21:25 - 1:21:26)
Wait a second.

[Speaker 1] (1:21:35 - 1:22:23)
All right, Sarah you're going to have to wait a few minutes. We're going back to an aldermanic application. And I'm going to read it into the record so we will be in.

We will be in the 10th Ward, page one committee members document number, a 8717 10th Ward ordinance was referred on September 14 to 21. Common Address is 132 31 South Burley Avenue. The change request, RS three residential single unit detached house district to a B three one community shopping district.

And we have joy, Molly, Molly from alderman said last week Garza.

[Speaker 25] (1:22:24 - 1:22:26)
Hello everyone. Good afternoon.

[Speaker 1] (1:22:27 - 1:22:31)
Molly, if you can do me a favor, can you take the mask off so we can hear you a little bit better.

[Speaker 25] (1:22:31 - 1:22:31)
Sure.

[Speaker 1] (1:22:33 - 1:22:36)
Thank you. Much better. Thank you.

[Speaker 25] (1:22:36 - 1:22:48)
Okay, okay. Yeah, so I'm here on behalf of Alderman Garza for this ordinance to change the zoning for 132 31 South Burley Avenue which is Henry Clay Elementary School.

[Speaker 1] (1:22:51 - 1:22:55)
And the purpose of the zoning change. I hear it's something to do with the sign.

[Speaker 25] (1:22:56 - 1:23:15)
Yes, so there's a marquee sign that the school would like to install at the same location where their current sign is. They just want to install a marquee sign which is digital so that they can display messages to students and staff and parents. And that's in order to get that sign installed this zoning changes necessary.

[Speaker 1] (1:23:16 - 1:23:24)
Well, thank you. Molly. Is it the alderman's intention.

Once the sign is up to revert the zoning back to the RS three.

[Speaker 41] (1:23:25 - 1:23:25)
Okay. Yes.

[Speaker 1] (1:23:26 - 1:23:42)
All right. Any questions, comments. Many members.

One quick question is this a private donation on the sign or a CPS put the sign up. No, the school has already paid for it they already have the sign within the student body community or the parents.

[Speaker 25] (1:23:42 - 1:23:43)
Yes. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:23:44 - 1:24:10)
Yeah, I'm jealous. I've done that a lot but you know if those are not. Those are expensive signs so right.

All right. Other questions, comments. Hearing none.

Can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum alderman Kaplan makes that motion. Any objections to the motion. Hearing none.

The item is passed. Thank you very much. Thank you, Molly.

[Speaker 37] (1:24:10 - 1:24:12)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:24:12 - 1:24:57)
All right. All right. All right.

All right. We're going to move to the middle of page two on an item in the first ward again. The attorney is now on the call.

It's document number 20844 T one first ward ordinance was referred on September 14 of 21 chain common address 1733 through 35 West Potomac Avenue, and the change request, RS three residential single unit detached house district to an RT for residential to flat townhome and multi unit district joy.

[Speaker 40] (1:25:00 - 1:25:12)
Good morning, I want to start by apologizing for earlier I don't know how I lost. No problem, no problem, but I did so I'm sorry to make you kind of come back a little bit for me.

[Speaker 1] (1:25:13 - 1:25:15)
Let's, let's, let's begin.

[Speaker 40] (1:25:15 - 1:26:04)
Yes, yes sir sorry. My clients are the owners of a two story residential single family home at 1733 35 West Potomac. They're proposing the zoning change from an RS three to an RT four to accommodate a proposed addition in the rear which will allow them to install solar panels which will exceed the height limitations of an RS three so they're seeking the RT four to allow for the installation of the solar panels.

Currently the house is a lead certified gold home, and my clients are looking to improve their environmental sustainability by installing the solar panels. Once the permitting is allowed the client my client's intention is to down zone back to the RS three.

[Speaker 1] (1:26:04 - 1:26:18)
All right. Joy question before we open up to committee members. So this is, this is a height issue.

Yes, it is. And what is the height of this thing.

[Speaker 40] (1:26:18 - 1:26:22)
Once constructed, it'll be 38 feet. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:26:25 - 1:27:28)
Um, we have a letter of support from all them in the spot on this issue. Any questions for the applicants. Hearing none.

Can I get a motion move to pass by the same roll call that would use to determine quorum. Move to pass all the way back makes that motion and the objections to the motion. Hearing on the item is passed.

Thank you, joy. Thank you. All right.

All right. At the page for committee members, we are on application number 208056 ward ordinance was referred on September 14 of 21 common address 7207 South Champlain Avenue. And the change request RS three residential single unit detached houses or to an RM 4.5 residential multi unit district, and we have Sarah Barnes on the call, Sarah.

[Speaker 4] (1:27:29 - 1:29:30)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Sarah Barnes and I'm an attorney with the last days of Sam banks. Happy to be here today on behalf of the applicant.

Lawler and Hamlin properties LLC. The applicant owns the subject property they actually recently acquired the subject property which is improved with a two story with an partially above grade basement residential building. They acquired the property with the intention to rehab and renovate the existing building and the dwelling units located there in so that they can put them back out, they, this company does affordable housing for veterans.

So the building currently contains three dwelling units one on each floor including that partially below grade or above grade basement on the bill, or the dwelling units are not in great shape right now and despite our due diligence we could not find a permit record for the dwelling units that is located in the basement. So in order to permit the renovation and also to ensure and occupy those units. We do require a zoning change, because the building is non conforming under the current RS three zoning.

And unfortunately this property does not fall within one of the ratified and ordained ADU pilot areas, so we are doing this exercise through city council. I have met with Alderman Sawyer, and we've reached out to the adjacent property owners as well. And it is my understanding that we do have a letter of support from Alderman Sawyer that has been tendered to the committee, and the residents as well have been very supportive.

I'm happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (1:29:31 - 1:29:42)
Sarah we do have a letter of support from Alderman Sawyer questions comments from committee members. Just quick one is this, this is not wouldn't be covered under the ADU. This is not an area.

[Speaker 4] (1:29:43 - 1:29:47)
Yeah, it's not in one of the pilot areas. Unfortunately, great.

[Speaker 1] (1:29:47 - 1:30:32)
Okay. Other questions comments. Hearing none.

Can I get a motion move to pass by the same roll call that would use to determine quorum. All the men walks back moves to pass any objections to the motion. Hearing none.

The item is passed. Thank you Sarah now we're moving in. Okay, back to the number middle of page for document number 20755 t 132nd Ward ordinance was referred on June 23 of 21 common address 1601 Northwestern Avenue and the change request, the three to community shopping district would be free to community shopping Sarah Barnes, please.

[Speaker 4] (1:30:32 - 1:33:53)
Good morning. Speak up, Sarah. Once more for the record, my name is Sarah Barnes and I am an attorney at the offices of Sam being happy to be here this afternoon or morning still on behalf of the applicant GW North and Western LLC.

The applicant does own the subject property and this is, I think, maybe the fourth, at least the third time we've been before this committee on substituting plans on a previously ratified type one zoning change for this site so I certainly commend other men wagons back because we've been working on this for about four years, the subject site is comprises the northeast corner of Western Avenue and North Avenue. It was previously a standalone pizza hut restaurant with a huge surface parking lot that was abandoned many years ago.

The applicant has had several different operators interested in and development programming ideas for the site but unfortunately due to kind of changing ways over the past couple of years, several of those contracts have been terminated. So we are here hopefully I pray for the last time, with the current proposal which calls for the construction of two new independent commercial buildings one story commercial buildings, one of those buildings is intended to be occupied by a national convenience store and the other one by a fast quick service, but good tasting restaurant. The intention for the restaurant is kind of unique, as many of you may have learned over the course of coven and other evolution.

The idea of ordering pre ordering your food and going to the restaurant and picking it up and taking it home with you has become quite the phenomenon as opposed to even a drive through so the rest of the operations for the restaurants are intended that you pre order. And then there is a going to be a pickup only window this is not a drive through it will not contain or it will not include a animated or an automated menu board, all of the orders will be placed on prior to pick up and then you can either drive in park and walk in and pick up your food, or you can pull up to the window where they will handy the food but there's no speakers lights. Anything of that sort.

So because this is a little bit of a unique use we have, again, been engaging with Alderman Wagstaff and his amazing staff as well we've had ongoing communications with many of the residents in the neighborhood to explain the new proposal, and I believe I will let speak for himself but I believe we do have general support for the proposal, as it has been described here today on towards that and Alderman I urge Mr Chairman I do have a substitute, if that's where.

[Speaker 1] (1:33:54 - 1:33:59)
Right. Okay. So before we go, we should have started with the substitute them.

[Speaker 4] (1:33:59 - 1:34:02)
I know. All right. Got excited.

[Speaker 1] (1:34:02 - 1:34:17)
I've been walking back moves to accept the substantive narrative plans for the type one application by the same role. Any objections to his motion. Hearing none.

The substitute is in front of us we've heard from the attorney, we will now hear from the Alderman.

[Speaker 16] (1:34:18 - 1:34:55)
Yes Alderman. This is definitely the last time I hope we come before the committee. We have communicated with our community groups and the individuals nearby there and everyone is, I think, on board with this project.

It is an amendment of the type one with this new substitute so I think Sarah. Miss Barnes put it, put it together pretty well about what we did with it so I would just ask for the favorable consideration of my committee members to fellow committee members to support this zoning change or plant planning purposes.

[Speaker 1] (1:34:55 - 1:35:29)
Thank you Alderman any questions before I ask a restaurant question. So, Miss Barnes talked at length about this concept. So you're aware of who the vendor is or who the chain is and as a restaurateur it's kind of unique in the sense that if they have a pickup window, and there's five pickups at the same time it'll be interesting to see how they, how they, you know how they line up so to speak, at the window.

[Speaker 16] (1:35:29 - 1:36:17)
My biggest concern was the, you know, we worked closely with all the neighbors on the curb cut issue, and making sure that we don't have excessive traffic coming in and out of there because we're talking about the corner of north and western on the northeast side there. Sarah's team did work on this. I think there was a little concern about pickup versus drive through but if the orders are done ahead as I think a lot of people are doing now where they just jump, jump out, pick up the order and it's already in there.

In their process I don't think it'll be a big issue that we might have to revisit that, you know, depending on what happens here but we did reduce curb cuts on this corner. In previous iterations to make sure that we reduce the impact on the corner, and we're working on the pedestrian issues as well.

[Speaker 1] (1:36:18 - 1:36:20)
Right. So, no indoor dining Scott.

[Speaker 16] (1:36:22 - 1:36:30)
No, this is what is it like 1000 square feet, or what, how big is Sarah do you have the square footage there.

[Speaker 4] (1:36:30 - 1:37:14)
And I'm Mr Chairman, just for everyone's edification. This will also the Department of Planning and Development is still treating this as a drive through. So it will need to go through site plan review because it will also require in addition to the type one a special use from the zoning Board of Appeals, so that they're in and we will be working with Sita and the Department of Planning and Development on any such issues as you indicated such as queuing and then vehicular navigation and pedestrian experience around the site.

The building is actually a 2400 square feet restaurant itself.

[Speaker 16] (1:37:14 - 1:37:25)
Yeah, the retail building is 4000 the restaurant is 2400 total project that they are 6400 with a point three.

[Speaker 1] (1:37:25 - 1:37:27)
So, all of it.

[Speaker 4] (1:37:27 - 1:37:31)
And 28 parking spaces, significant parking.

[Speaker 1] (1:37:31 - 1:37:38)
Okay, let me let me interrupt for a second. Has the user been identified to the neighbors.

[Speaker 16] (1:37:42 - 1:37:49)
Yes. And Sarah I don't know if you actually have a contract with them yet.

[Speaker 4] (1:37:49 - 1:38:22)
Yeah, we have a letter of intent for a week for a lease, but I think that we actually disclosed it to the Department of Planning and Development so it's subject to Freedom of Information Act. Chairman Tony so I think it. Let me do a Freedom of Information request, I was gonna say I'm comfortable in a way six weeks for.

I'm comfortable in light of that sharing who the tenant is and we have had, we have shared that with the neighbors on it's going to be Chipotle.

[Speaker 1] (1:38:22 - 1:38:54)
All right, well that that's all one word says it all. Okay, so, yeah. Okay.

Alrighty. Okay. Other questions, comments from committee members.

Hearing none. Can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum alderman Kaplan makes that motion. Any objections to the motion.

Hearing none. This item is passed with. For the last time, the substantive narrative and plans.

[Speaker 16] (1:38:55 - 1:38:57)
Okay, we're not coming back on this one chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:38:57 - 1:39:04)
All right, well, thank you. I, I've got the address firmly embedded in my mind okay northeast corner. All right.

Good luck. All right.

[Speaker 4] (1:39:05 - 1:39:06)
Yeah, thanks everyone. Thank you alderman.

[Speaker 6] (1:39:45 - 1:40:09)
Good morning Mr Chairman members of the committee Michael Asger from the law firm of the Casa Asger on behalf of the applicant. And as you suggested we are requesting the zoning change we've been working to add an additional unit to an existing building. We've worked with Alderman Scott and his office, and we are.

He, I believe that he has a letter of support on file with the department and we're here to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (1:40:12 - 1:41:10)
Okay. So we do have a letter of support from Alderman Scott. And obviously it looks like there's no change to the size of the building and just a dwelling unit in the basement.

Right. Okay. Correct.

All right, questions, comments committee members. Hearing none. Can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine form form.

This is, there's an existing our client has an existing business called the Augusta food and wine, and they've been operating in the building for some time and they wanted to expand to have the wine bar portion of the Augusta food and wine, which required us to change for a use from the one to see one, no changes to the building.

We worked with Alderman Martin, and the 47th Ward and have a letter of support on file with the committee and we're here to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (1:41:50 - 1:42:20)
All right, we do have a letter of support from Alderman Martin, like a nice addition to his neighborhood. Any questions and comments. Hearing none.

Alderman Osterman makes the motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to his motion. Hearing none of the item is passed, and Michael you'll have to hold on when we get back to the 28th board.

[Speaker 6] (1:42:21 - 1:42:22)
Thank you, Mr Chairman will do.

[Speaker 1] (1:42:23 - 1:42:49)
Okay, bottom of page four, or I'm sorry bottom of page five. We are on document number 20820 fourth board ordinance was referred on September 14 and 21 common address is 4341 to 4343 South cottage Grove Avenue, and the change request. Be one one neighborhood shopping district to be three to community shopping district.

[Speaker 2] (1:42:49 - 1:44:19)
We have Rolando. Good morning Mr Chairman members of the committee Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant. The matter before you involves a proposal that is spearheaded by Harry Lennox, who is a Chicago born actor, he currently portrays Harold Cooper on the blacklist.

He wants to get back to his community and celebrate African American performing arts, and for that purpose he has formed an entity that proposes to convert the existing building into a theater. It will have a 350 seat theater within the building as well as 100 seat theater Mr Chairman this building is an old Marshall fields warehouse it's actually a sister building to the briar street theater building in your word. So it's going to be used similarly to that theater.

It has received significant community support it's about an 11,500 square foot building parking will be dealt with by leases off site with adjacent properties. The, we have discussed this with the alderman, it's also been reviewed by the Department of Planning, as it is a subject of some assistance that has been offered by the city and making this a reality. I believe alderman King has expressed her support for this project.

And with that, I'm happy to answer any questions that the chairman of the committee may have.

[Speaker 1] (1:44:19 - 1:44:27)
Thank you, Rolando, I think we have alderman Sophia King and or Prentice, who would like to speak.

[Speaker 10] (1:44:27 - 1:44:33)
I know I know that back and forth between meetings chairman but I'm definitely here.

[Speaker 1] (1:44:34 - 1:44:38)
The theater on the 4343 South cottage.

[Speaker 10] (1:44:39 - 1:46:52)
So, thank you, but would you like my comments now, Chairman. Yes, yes, please. Okay.

So, first of all, I just want to, you know, state from, from the outset that the applicant is a friend of mine. We've known each other for many years. I, a number of people know him, you know, in his capacity as an actor, but he's a friend of mine.

And I say this, you know, in the interest of just full disclosure, because my support for this project is based entirely on the merits of the project itself and has no bearing on the fact that I know him. But, you know, here's why I support the project. So, as you guys probably know there's a sister project.

The Briar Street project that was rehabbed in the, I think in the, in the 70s. And, and this project seeks to do something similar. It's a formal Marshall Fields and Company carriage house, and it's going to take it and rehab it into a theater as well.

It will bring, you know, a long sought after amenity to the neighborhood, will be the host of an African American Museum for the Performing Arts, will create jobs, both part time and full time. And really we'll just add some vitality, economic development to a beleaguered building, but we'll just bring amenities to Cottage Grove, which has a number of things happening there. Right now it's an invest Southwest area.

And so there are a number of projects that are occurring there this would just only add to not only this particular street but to the larger Bronzeville community so I wholeheartedly support this project and I'm asking for the support of my colleagues here today.

[Speaker 1] (1:46:53 - 1:47:08)
Other woman, it sounds like an amazing project I hope you're is at least as successful as the Briar Street theater has been like community. One quick question though, not familiar with South Cottage Grove, where is the parking.

[Speaker 2] (1:47:08 - 1:47:45)
So, I can answer that Mr Chairman. There's two options for parking there's a city facility that is used during the day, it is an educational community center. So we are discussing what it holds about 63 parking spaces.

Since the theater will operate on weekends and evenings, we have discussed with the city, the possibility of leasing that property for use as parking. There's also a vacant parcel to the west to the east of the building that we're seeking to try to acquire that would also serve as parking if we're successful in acquiring older woman came. Anything else.

[Speaker 10] (1:47:47 - 1:47:56)
No, I, I think that this would be a great amenity to, you know, our community and again I'm asking for the support of this committee.

[Speaker 1] (1:47:56 - 1:48:02)
Thank you very much. Sounds exciting. You know we just have on the north side we definitely have a problem with the parking.

[Speaker 10] (1:48:02 - 1:48:23)
Yeah, once you're in your word. Oh, okay. So this literally the buildings are, you know, twin replicas.

Yes. And so it's, it's interesting to understand that, and, you know, we hope to be as successful as Briar Street is in your community.

[Speaker 1] (1:48:23 - 1:48:27)
Yep, I think they've been, if I'm not mistaken, 25 years running.

[Speaker 10] (1:48:29 - 1:48:37)
Right, I'm definitely familiar been in there and didn't understand the connection until now until the last couple of years.

[Speaker 1] (1:48:38 - 1:50:14)
So, all right, well, other questions and comments. Hearing none. Alderman Dowell makes a motion to move to pass by the same roll call it would use to determine quorum.

Any objections to her motion. Hearing none, the item is passed. Congratulations.

Good luck to you on that one. Thank you, Chairman. Okay.

All right, now we have, we're going to go back to Alderman Irvin is on the call. Alderman Irvin, nice to see you. You've got a number of things in front of our committee.

I'm going to start with bottom of page one. document number, a 8715 28th Ward ordinance was referred on July 21 of 21, the change. Let's see the change request to classify a segment of the West Taylor right of way from the center line of South Racine Avenue on the east and the center line of South Loomis Avenue or street on the west side as a pedestrian street.

Alderman Irvin on this one.

[Speaker 15] (1:50:14 - 1:50:38)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is something being done to connect both pedestrian streets along Taylor. We're also working in conjunction with CHA and related on development at the corner of Racine and Taylor, and making this a pedestrian street throughout essentially from Ashland all the way back to Morgan is in the best interest of all concerned would ask for the committee support.

[Speaker 1] (1:50:38 - 1:52:20)
Thank you all demand any questions for the Alderman comments. Hearing none, can I get a motion move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum Alderman Hopkins makes that motion. Move to pass any objection to the motion.

Hearing none, this item is passed. Now we are. The one above it.

Okay, staying on page one automatic a 8728 27th and the 28th Ward ordinances referred on March 13 of 19 common address. The Illinois Medical District, also known as the area bounded by the north line of West Congress Parkway, South Ashland Avenue alley next south of West 15th Street. South Alina Street, West 15th Street, South Wood Street.

So that's the alley. South Damon Avenue, the north line of the Chicago and Northwestern railroad right of way, and South Oakley Boulevard. Oh, I'm sorry, I missed West 14th Street itself.

All right. This is a change request institutional plan development number 30 and see one to neighborhood commercial district, the institutional plan development number 30 as amended. So we have both Alderman urban and Alderman Burnett on this application, all been urban would you like to start.

[Speaker 15] (1:52:21 - 1:53:01)
Yes, this is the Illinois Medical District, which lies in both the 27th and 28th wards. This change is essentially creating additional uses primarily on the south end of the of the district where you see a lot of green and a lot of vacant land essentially is to bring the district's land use into compliance with 21st century thinking, and to bring forth ideas that will create jobs and better residents and community only in the west side of Chicago, but also for our city in its entirety. Alderman Burnett may have a few words as well but I definitely want to move forward with this.

[Speaker 1] (1:53:02 - 1:53:10)
All right, thank you Alderman urban Alderman Burnett want to chime in on this also. Yes, I concur with Alderman Irving.

[Speaker 35] (1:53:11 - 1:53:28)
Also what this does is bring in the new AR ordinance into this into this area so whenever someone do something and they are starting to do more residential in this area, it would incorporate affordable housing, some of the full support of this.

[Speaker 1] (1:53:28 - 1:55:02)
Thank you both aldermans questions for the alderman have any hands up. Can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that would use the current quorum. It's past all the way back, Scott Wagsback makes the motion.

Any objections to the motion. Hearing on the item is passed. Thank you both.

Are we still with all of an urban or not. Yep. All right, Jason we're going to go to the bottom page for and committee members at large.

We have item number 20751 28th Ward ordinance was referred on June 23 or 21 common addresses 5050 through 5098 and 5093 through 5099, all on West Jackson Boulevard 235 through 313 South Leamington Avenue 5043 through 5050 90, I'm sorry, 5043 to 5099 West Quincy. The change request institutional plan development number 1103 and RT for residential to flat townhouse and multi unit district to all to an RM 4.5 residential multi unit district and then to an institutional plan development number 1103, as amended. We're back to Michael Edgar on this and I think we have slides on this one.

[Speaker 6] (1:55:03 - 1:56:15)
Yes, thank you Mr Chairman again good morning, and to the members of the committee as well Michael as good from the law firm of Acosta as good on behalf of the Chicago Jesuit Academy, and this little background briefly. The Chicago Jesuit Academy is a full scholarship lower in middle income school for children from modest economic backgrounds who cannot otherwise access well resource college preparatory education. And since 2007 CJA has been serving the Austin neighborhood on Chicago's west side CJA enroll students without regard for their past level of academic achievement or economic status, and traditionally CJA has served young men from the area.

And the project before you today is an expansion of the CJA campus to allow it to also serve young women from the area. As a preliminary matter this was heard and approved at the September plan commission, so I'd ask that the record of that proceeding be incorporated here and mission.

[Speaker 1] (1:56:15 - 1:56:28)
I'm sorry, Alderman hadn't moves to incorporate the records for the planning commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to our motion. Hearing on the records are now incorporated continue.

[Speaker 6] (1:56:29 - 1:59:44)
Sure, thank you, and the slide you're looking at shows the existing site plan and the existing campus, the building to the south, the blue and gray sort of newer building is Christ the King School, which is in sub area B of this plan development, and the buildings to the east is the Chicago Jesuit Academy current campus, and the next slide will show the proposed addition of the new building to the west of the existing CJA campus, it runs along Quincy Street, and the next slide will show the building from the opposite looking south you can see the new building was.

We work closely with Alderman Irvin, the community, as well as DPD to come up with a building that not only fits in but handles some of the other issues with parking and drop off and pick up. And if you go to the next slide. We can see the elevation of the new building and you can see that one of the things that we've done is to create some public art space as well on the ground floor.

And although this image only shows one such public art display, the intention is to have those on the ground floor, be able to also have some good public art for the area. And the, I think, is there another slide. Yes, this shows the interior courtyard, that's being preserved.

There's some onsite pick up and drop off. We're also. I'm not sure if there's another slide or not.

If not, we can go back to the, we can, we can go back to the beginning I suppose. And you can see that the existing, there's some parking currently on site, and then the parking for this project, along with the expansion will be expanded on to the south side of Jackson and Leamington. Michael, Michael, Michael.

Yes, show me, show me for the benefit of the meeting where the parking. So there's two parking expansions one will be along the, the southeast corner of Leamington and Jackson. There's a.

So right on, right on this corner. There's a vacant city owned lot, which we are in the process of working with DPD to acquire. And then there's another single family home which we are also acquiring.

And those, those two will be combined to provide some parking for expanded parking for Christ the King. And then there are two single family homes along Quincy that are also being acquired and as part of the PD to expand parking for CJA. Again, we've worked with the alderman community and DPD to to craft a good, a good plan, a good site plan.

All right. All right. Continue.

And with all that that that explains the project it explains what we've done so far. We're here to answer any questions and Alderman Irvin is on the call. Alderman Irvin.

[Speaker 15] (1:59:46 - 2:00:33)
Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As Attorney Ezra stated this expansion of Chicago Jesuit Academy and Christ the King high school plan development, we met with members in the community.

And there is support for making these adjustments. While we did not necessarily want to lose a single family housing. We really found that there was no other way to make this work.

And without, you know, going underground and which was fairly cost prohibitive and making that particular way to do parking work. But overall, Chicago Jesuit and Christ the King do very good for residents of the west side of Chicago, and we support their planned expansion.

[Speaker 1] (2:00:35 - 2:00:45)
Thank you. Thank you, Jason. So, for the benefit of the committee.

What's this, what's the enrollment with this combined campus.

[Speaker 6] (2:00:49 - 2:00:51)
I just lost my narrative. Hold on.

[Speaker 15] (2:00:55 - 2:00:58)
With both the elementary and high school you're asking.

[Speaker 1] (2:00:59 - 2:01:13)
Yeah, and I'm getting to the point where, okay, you've got x number of students. And you got faculty and what is the ratio of a student, you know the whole size of this thing with the number of parking spaces. That's where I'm going with it.

[Speaker 15] (2:01:13 - 2:02:10)
Oh, well, what we found is that currently, the number of spaces that are being utilized on a day to day basis are not 100%. You're adding over 100% number of spaces, where you're only adding maybe 30% more students. When you look at it in this totality.

So we do believe that the site is adequately part, the only challenge comes up. And this has been on an ongoing challenges when there's special events. For example, a basketball game at the at at Christ the King, you know when you're going to draw three 400 people, that's a, that's a challenge.

But other than that, the day to day operations of the school, we do not believe will have a detrimental impact on the community, because the site will be adequately parked.

[Speaker 1] (2:02:11 - 2:02:48)
Thank you all the men. Obviously, this is an amazing existing facility and expanding to serve the west side it's a, you know, very familiar with the Jesuit teachings, and it's, it's, it's a real tribute to add that to the west side or continue to add to the west side. You want a pattern where you know that was frat life when I'm older.

Oh, okay, I thought you know I know I know I maybe maybe maybe in high school. Anyways, I'm, I'm all better for my experience. Let's just say that.

[Speaker 15] (2:02:49 - 2:02:49)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:02:50 - 2:02:50)
All right.

[Speaker 15] (2:02:51 - 2:02:51)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:02:52 - 2:03:15)
It's exciting though they really do an amazing job. Questions, comments. Nope.

All right. Can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that would you determine form. Alderman Kappelman moves to pass Alderman Kappelman makes that motion.

Any objections to the motion. Hearing on the item is passed as revised.

[Speaker 15] (2:03:15 - 2:03:21)
Thank you guys. Are you a Jesuit Kappelman were you in the Jesuit order.

[Speaker 2] (2:03:22 - 2:03:24)
No, Francisco, Francisco.

[Speaker 15] (2:03:25 - 2:03:30)
Okay. All right. All righty.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:03:30 - 2:03:55)
Page six and the right step. Okay. Top of page six document number 20832 T one, 12th Ward ordinance was referred on September 14 and 21 common addresses 2720 West Cermak road change request be two three neighborhood mixed use district to be two three neighborhood mixed use district, Rolando.

[Speaker 2] (2:03:55 - 2:04:55)
Good afternoon, Mr Chairman members of the committee Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant. The matter before you involves an existing property that has a three unit building that is set back to the rear of the lot basically built on the alley. The proposal is to build a front addition and add three more units for a total of six units.

The property will have three parking spaces, it is a transit served location. We have previously we zone this for purposes of adding only residential. This Cermak is a commercial street has many commercial uses as part of this proposal, we will be adding some ground for commercial, about 700 square feet along the Cermak frontage which brings it in keeping with the neighborhood, and the commercial nature of Cermak street as well as the additional units.

I believe Alderman Cardenas has communicated support for this to the committee. And with that I'm happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (2:04:57 - 2:05:04)
Rolando. Sir. The.

What is the reduction in parking.

[Speaker 2] (2:05:05 - 2:05:13)
So it would be three parking spaces, versus the required six, so there's, there would be 50% 50% reduction.

[Speaker 1] (2:05:13 - 2:05:25)
All right. And you have met with the Alderman. Yes.

And the Alderman is advised that he is neutral on this project.

[Speaker 2] (2:05:25 - 2:05:28)
He has yes he has no objection to it but otherwise.

[Speaker 1] (2:05:28 - 2:06:27)
Okay, just for the record for the member for the, for my committee members. Okay, so questions for the applicant on this one. No questions, can I get a motion move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Alderman Kaplan makes that motion. Any objection to his motion. Hearing on the items past.

Okay, now we're moving to the bottom of page six document number 20826 t one in the fifth ward ordinance was referred on September 14 and 21 common address is 2315 West 24th place to change request from an RM six residential multi unit district neighborhood mixed use district. All right. Rolando.

This is in the 25th board.

[Speaker 2] (2:06:30 - 2:06:41)
We have you obviously been working with the Alderman on this, we have been working with the Alderman on this however I was advised this morning by the Alderman he'd like this matter from a page seven in his award to be deferred.

[Speaker 1] (2:06:44 - 2:08:45)
Okay, so we will make a motion to defer this item document number 20826 t one in the 25th ward. Again, the address is 23 West 2315 West 24th place so I get a motion to defer this item. Alderman Kaplan and so moves Alderman makes a motion to defer the item.

Any objections to the motion. Hearing on this item is deferred. All right, while we're on the 25th ward I'm going to move to page seven on the bottom.

While we have another deferral this is item number 19933 t one 25th ward ordinance was referred on January 23 of 19 address 2324 West Cullerton street, and the change request from an RT for residential to flat townhouse and multi unit district to be to three neighborhood mixed use district. I need a motion to defer this item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Alderman Kaplan makes that motion to defer any objections to the motion.

Hearing on this item also is deferred. All right, Rolando that's, that's an old application, that's more to do on that one. All right.

Okay, now we're on the top of page seven document number 20823 t one 30th ward ordinance was referred on September 14 of 21 common addresses 5416 through 5424 West Belmont Avenue, and the change request be three one community shopping district to be to three neighborhood mixed use district, Rolando.

[Speaker 2] (2:08:45 - 2:09:37)
Once again, Mr Chairman Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant property before you is mid block on Belmont, it contains about 12,500 square feet and is improved of land, and is improved to the one story commercial building. The proposal is to rehabilitate the ground floor and add two stories to the existing building, resulting in about 8000 square feet of commercial space along the Belmont frontage. We will also have one dwelling unit on the ground floor that will be an ADA unit, as well as 12 additional units on the upper two floors that will be added to the existing building 13 parking spaces will be provided on site.

We did have a community meeting on this matter. It's an alderman report is his word, and had no objections to the proposal.

[Speaker 1] (2:09:38 - 2:10:05)
Hi, Rolando we do have a letter of support from Alderman report yes. Only question I have is the existing building one story and then you're adding residential on top of it. Is there an existing commercial tenant.

There's no, there's no existing commercial okay so you're starting from scratch, new commercial with, they say 13 residential units, and then the number of parking spaces, I'm sorry, 13.

[Speaker 41] (2:10:05 - 2:10:06)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:10:06 - 2:10:54)
All right. As I said, committee members we do have a letter of support from all the member boy is going to get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine form. I'll move to Alderman Lopez Alderman Raymond Lopez makes the motion and he opposed.

Any objections to the motion. Hearing none. The item is passed.

All right, moving on again in the 30th Ward paid seven middle document number 20807 30th Ward ordinance was referred on September 14 of 2021. This common address 2419 through 2425 North Central Avenue, change requests from an RS three residential single unit detached house district to a B to one neighborhood mixed use district, Rolando.

[Speaker 2] (2:10:55 - 2:11:54)
Once again, Mr Chairman. Last, last item I have this Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant. The proposal here is to rezone the property so that we can provide some offsite additional parking for a restaurant.

There is existing restaurant there was an existing restaurant restaurant at 2430 North Central across Central Avenue from this location. It is being rehabilitated for a cozy corner restaurant. The owner wishes to have some additional parking to serve that restaurant.

And for that purpose has purchased this property, it will contain 23 parking spaces, it will have a 10 foot wide landscape buffer around the entire property that will contain trees as well as shrubs and other amenities, and the access to the proposed parking lot will be from Central Avenue. Again, we have consulted with Alderman reporters on this matter, and I believe he is supported.

[Speaker 1] (2:11:55 - 2:12:21)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman reporters. I know this is a successful concept I believe started in, I think, almost like you are almost like you're on Lincoln, if I'm not mistaken, but anyways, they do a real, real nice job there, but the parking. In general, is how safe is the parking isn't adjacent to it is it across the street or across.

[Speaker 2] (2:12:22 - 2:12:42)
It is across the street from the site, it's probably I'm going to say about 150 feet to get to the intersection to cross the street to it there's also parking. There's current parking on the same property as the restaurant. There's probably about 10 parking spaces on that site, but some additional parking was desired, hence this location.

[Speaker 1] (2:12:42 - 2:14:19)
Yeah, I'm just thinking of the safety issue, you know, kind of cross. Yeah. All right.

Good. Any questions, comments. Hearing none.

We do have a lot of support from Alderman rebellious Alderman Kaplan makes the motion to move to pass by the same roll call that we choose to determine form. Any objections to his motion. Hearing none, the item is passed.

Again, a great addition to the 30th board I believe I think will be very successful. Thank you, Mr Chairman members committee. Okay, let me, let me.

My staff says we have page eight. Our attorney Lewis Powell is not on the call yet. So we will hold that item.

Alright, so we do have three. That's me. Okay, all right, I'll have to do it.

Just easy way, we do have Kareem from the office of Lewis how. So we will move forward on document number 20839 in the sixth ward ordinance was referred on September 14 of 21 common address to 7310 South Halston Street. The change request be one to neighborhood shopping district to an M 11 limited manufacturing business park district.

[Speaker 1] (2:16:40 - 2:17:03)
Okay. All right. With that, any questions.

Comments. All right, a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum alderman Burnett makes that motion. Any objections to his motion.

Hearing on the items past.

[Speaker 27] (2:17:04 - 2:17:08)
All right, we thank you for your consideration, as well as the committee.

[Speaker 1] (2:17:08 - 2:17:09)
Thank you, sir, and good luck.

[Speaker 27] (2:17:10 - 2:17:11)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:17:12 - 2:17:50)
Don't be drinking too much of that stuff. Okay. Okay.

Personal experience. Okay, so. All right.

Let's see middle of page eight document number 20804 sixth ward ordinance was referred on September 14 of 21 common address 745 East 75th Street. Change request be one one neighborhood shopping district to see one one neighborhood commercial district. Tomorrow, Walker.

Yes, good afternoon Chairman How are you this afternoon. Good afternoon. Let's talk about East 75th Street, please.

[Speaker 24] (2:17:51 - 2:19:14)
Sure. For the record, my name is Tamara Walker, and I'm an attorney and my office is located at 1016 West Jackson Avenue here in Chicago. So I'm here today on behalf of the applicant, the social network LLC.

And it's for a property located at 745 East 75th Street. So, currently the subject is an existing two story brick building with a one story patio. I'm sorry with a one story portion at the rear of the property, the property sits on a 2487.5 square foot lot. The applicant is here proposing to establish a general restaurant on the first and second floors with a rooftop patio that's why I misspoke about the rooftop. So he's looking for a rooftop patio on the second floor. There are no dwelling units in the building, and there's no on site parking currently at the property.

So we filed an application to amend the zoning from a B that be one dash one neighborhood shopping district to a C one dash one neighborhood commercial district in order to allow for the applicant to conduct his business. And we do have the support of Alderman Roderick Sawyer. We've sent all the proper notification to the community, and we are available for questions.

Chairman, thank you. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:19:15 - 2:19:22)
Tomorrow, would you please forward a copy of the Alderman's recommendation to Nicole and our committee. Sure.

[Speaker 25] (2:19:22 - 2:19:24)
We've been in communication tomorrow I can email you.

[Speaker 1] (2:19:25 - 2:19:45)
Okay. All right. All right.

So, if this is, again you're talking to the wrong zoning committee person being a restaurateur I usually have a question or two. So, it's 2500 square feet is the plot of is basically the size of the building.

[Speaker 24] (2:19:47 - 2:19:56)
The building square footage our land use consultant is also on the call Mr Musa where I am looking to see if I have the exact square footage of the building.

[Speaker 1] (2:19:58 - 2:20:01)
If you're doing a two story restaurant, and a patio on the road.

[Speaker 24] (2:20:02 - 2:20:02)
Correct.

[Speaker 1] (2:20:03 - 2:20:10)
So it's not a it's a fairly sizable operation. Right, that is correct. And then you mentioned about parking or not.

[Speaker 24] (2:20:11 - 2:20:45)
Currently there is no parking. Mr Donnell Digby is the owner in the principal member of the social network LLC. He is looking to obtain additional parking.

As of now, in that location adequate street parking he actually was in the process of obtaining additional property but that deal was unsuccessful, so he is still looking to obtain additional parking. However, currently there is enough street parking in the area to support that business. Any on the commercial corridors and not on the residential.

[Speaker 1] (2:20:45 - 2:21:24)
Correct. Okay. All right, and the ultimate is aware of that obviously and he's definitely supportive of the, of the economic development coming forward.

Absolutely. If you would just forward that to the poll and figure it out. But we do have his support letter or we will have a support letter.

Any questions, comments from other committee members. Hearing none. Can I get a motion to move to pass by the same role colors used to determine quorum.

It's passed all the way back makes motion any objections to his motion. Hearing on the item is passed.

[Speaker 24] (2:21:24 - 2:21:27)
Good luck to you. You know, get the letters in the call today.

[Speaker 1] (2:21:28 - 2:22:08)
Yeah, and maybe we'll have some Northsiders going to 75th Street for a change. How about that. Thank you.

Cup fans are going to be allowed, maybe. Oh, absolutely, but I had to follow the crowd today. Thank you.

All right, good luck. All right, bottom of page eight document number 20808 ninth board ordinance was referred on September 14 and 21 common addresses 10701 South Martin Luther King Drive, and the change request RT for residential two flat town home and multi unit district to a B three to community shopping district. And this is James Stola on the call, James.

[Speaker 36] (2:22:09 - 2:23:25)
Yeah, for the record James stole on the attorney for the applicant rose cafe LLC, and they proposed to open a coffee shop with minimal food preparation. They're going to rehab, an existing building that's a one story commercial building that has been boarded up for quite some time. It's previously was used over 30 years ago and perhaps within the last 30 years as a dry cleaners.

Before the zoning change to an RT for now across the street is on B three to, so it's consistent with the, with the area, and they're not going to change the footprint of the building or just going to rehab it to open up a coffee shop, and just for also just in case there's any issues with it there is a church across the street across Martin Luther King Drive there. So, if that's an issue at all. But it seems to be a good location for this type of a business there's nothing, or this type of a coffee shop because there's nothing really in that area, and there's a lot of multi unit buildings, and across the street and the street also, but it's going to be consistent with the with the neighborhood because it isn't our, it isn't a B three to across the street.

I have nothing further.

[Speaker 1] (2:23:26 - 2:23:32)
Thank you, James you've met with Alderman Beal and we have, it's my understanding that we have his support.

[Speaker 36] (2:23:33 - 2:23:36)
We have been communicating with them and with the community group.

[Speaker 1] (2:23:37 - 2:23:42)
Well we're going to hear from Alderman Beal right now if he's on the call. I'm here Mr Chairman. All right.

[Speaker 9] (2:23:43 - 2:23:46)
You talked about the South Martin Luther King Drive coffee shop.

[Speaker 5] (2:23:47 - 2:24:18)
Mr Stola is exactly correct. This building has been vacant for a long time and it's an old dry cleaners. And, you know, I'm excited to put this property back in use in the community, it's going to be a small coffee shop with some reading area, and hopefully we can grow this business because there are a couple of empty lots, just to the east of it.

Where we can use it as parking, and, you know, I think this would be a great amenity to the community as well by putting this property back in use so I'm in full support and ask the committee to support it as well.

[Speaker 1] (2:24:19 - 2:24:28)
Thank you Alderman. Questions for the Alderman or the applicant. Hearing none.

Can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call it used to determine quorum.

[Speaker 16] (2:24:28 - 2:24:30)
It's passed by Alderman Wagesback.

[Speaker 1] (2:24:30 - 2:24:39)
Alderman Wagesback makes the motion and the objections to the motion. Hearing none the item is passed. Alderman Beal, do you have anything else on that.

[Speaker 15] (2:24:39 - 2:24:45)
I think that's all I have Mr Chairman. Thank you so much. Thank you.

Thank you. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:24:45 - 2:25:11)
Alrighty, top of page nine document number 20834 t one in the 11th Ward ordinance was referred on September 14 of 21, the common address to 2745 South Princeton Avenue, the change request, RS three residential single unit detached house district to an RM 5.5 residential multi unit district. Mark Kupiec.

[Speaker 33] (2:25:13 - 2:26:19)
Mr Chairman, Mark Kupiec, I'm an attorney with offices at 77 West Washington represent the applicant applicant is also the owner of the subject property. This property is already developed with two old buildings, an old multi unit building in the front, and the old coach house building in the rear. The applicant was attempting to get a building permit to remodel the buildings, but ran into a problem because we could not find a permit record for all the existing apartments.

The plan is to rezone the property and pull a permit to remodel the building, as is with the existing apartments, five in the front building two in the rear building. We've been working on this for a while, started off by meeting with Alderman Thompson. wanted a community meeting we had a little delay with the pandemic but we did have a virtual community meeting, and no neighbors expressed any problems with it.

And with that we followed up with the alderman and his staff, and I do believe you have his letter of support.

[Speaker 1] (2:26:21 - 2:26:23)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Thompson.

[Speaker 33] (2:26:25 - 2:26:27)
And with that we'd ask for your recommendation.

[Speaker 1] (2:26:27 - 2:26:36)
All right, so existing building. Yes permits. Basically keeping the same number of units seven.

[Speaker 33] (2:26:36 - 2:26:37)
Correct.

[Speaker 1] (2:26:37 - 2:26:40)
And I'll ask the proverbial question is their parking.

[Speaker 33] (2:26:41 - 2:26:56)
Well it's in the existing parking that we're keeping the existing coach house, but the these buildings 100 year old buildings, they've got the parking that they've, they've always had on site and we're maintaining existing parking spaces on the first floor of the coach house.

[Speaker 1] (2:26:57 - 2:26:58)
We didn't answer my question.

[Speaker 33] (2:26:59 - 2:27:06)
We do not have seven spaces, no. Well how many do you have Mark, I believe we've got, I believe we've got three.

[Speaker 1] (2:27:07 - 2:27:33)
Okay, just for the record. Okay. Alrighty.

Questions, comments from the committee. Again, we do have a letter of support from Alderman Thompson. Can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine form.

It's passed by Alderman Wagesbeck Alderman Wagesbeck makes that motion any objections to his motion. Hearing none the items past. All right, thank you, Mark.

[Speaker 16] (2:27:34 - 2:27:34)

Good afternoon Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant. The property before you has an existing building on it with a total of six dwelling units on the property it has space in the basement to add two additional units. I don't believe there's any parking on site Mr Chairman, but we are requesting that we change the zoning of this property in order to allow us to add two more units in the basement.

This is not an ADU area. Otherwise we would have proceeded in that fashion.

[Speaker 1] (2:32:10 - 2:33:30)
All right, well that that's pretty straightforward. I know we have a letter of support from Alderman CTO Lopez. Any comments, questions from committee members.

He met a Castro and I sorry I mispronounced the first name I should know better. Okay.

[Speaker 21] (2:34:39 - 2:35:27)
Good afternoon. My name is human and Castro I apologize for my Halloween decorations in the back. I'm a zoning attorney at a cost to Asger and I am the attorney for the matter before you I apologize for the technical issues on the case before.

Thank you to Rolando for covering. So the matter before you today is, as you mentioned, 2120 West Armitage, this is an existing to flat is a legal nonconforming residential unit on the ground floor. And it's legal nonconforming because it is a B three to zoning district currently so it is a grandfathered unit essentially.

So we are rezoning it to an RT for which fits the area in order to legalize that unit, and we have support from the Alderman's office as well and I believe he is on the call.

[Speaker 1] (2:35:29 - 2:35:37)
We do have Alderman walk us back on the call. Scott you want to talk about West Armitage please 2120.

[Speaker 16] (2:35:37 - 2:35:55)
Yes, sir. We got the support of the community organization and this is to simply legalize the ground floor, legal nonconforming use for this property it's been a residential use for quite some time. And this would just bring it into conformance for planning purposes.

[Speaker 1] (2:35:55 - 2:35:56)
All right.

[Speaker 16] (2:35:56 - 2:35:58)

You met a Castro please.

[Speaker 21] (2:36:44 - 2:37:23)
Yes. Hello again, this is human Castro the attorney for the matter before you today. This project is also very straightforward, we are trying to rezone the property.

It's actually has two different zoning so the property is sort of split into, you can imagine, part of the property is C one one. The other part of the property is and one one and we're trying to rezone it to C one one to just have the zoning be one zoning. And we are going to be building a one story commercial building for office space, a parking spaces, and we have an automatic letter of support as well.

[Speaker 1] (2:37:24 - 2:37:56)
Do you have. We first of all we have a substantive narrative plans I believe. Correct.

Okay, so all the men walks back moves to accept the substantive narrative plans for the by the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine form. Any objections to his motion. Hearing on the substantive narrative plans are in front of us.

I think you've made your description. We have Sergio I believe from Alderman Vegas his office that would like to speak on this item, sir.

[Speaker 16] (2:37:56 - 2:38:02)
Sergio from Alderman Alderman Vegas his office, you have to step away but he does support this matter.

[Speaker 1] (2:38:04 - 2:38:14)
Okay, so we'll have that on file. Who is that chairman Susanna Robles and zoning and a long time no talk to.

[Speaker 38] (2:38:14 - 2:38:20)
Yes, I was just, I did not receive the substitute narrative and plan that.

[Speaker 19] (2:38:22 - 2:38:26)
Oh, looking through here. I don't have that.

[Speaker 41] (2:38:27 - 2:38:28)
Let's see.

[Speaker 19] (2:38:30 - 2:38:37)
That might have been my error. So I don't know the changes. Okay.

[Speaker 12] (2:38:37 - 2:38:39)
Oh, there were no changes I apologize.

[Speaker 1] (2:38:41 - 2:38:46)
Well wait wait wait. So Nicole, would you read it what do you what do you say, I don't know.

[Speaker 12] (2:38:46 - 2:38:54)

He met, let's go back to you on this thing. Okay, so the address on application 20821 t one. Oh two one.

20821 t 136 more. He met our record.

[Speaker 21] (2:39:13 - 2:39:19)
I don't believe there is a narrative, there is a substitute. I believe I misspoke.

[Speaker 1] (2:39:20 - 2:40:18)
Well we both misspoke I think so let's let's let's let's nullify that and for Anna's edification. We do not have a substantive narrative and plan so what I'm going to ask is, I'm going to ask you. If there's any questions from committee members in regards to this technical issue, and get another motion to accept this on its face without this up without any substitute or narrative plans.

So with that I'm going to ask for the motion moved to pass by the roll call that was used to determine form. And that'd be all been Vegas. I'm sorry not Vegas here, all men walks back moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine form.

Any objections to that motion. Okay, so hearing no objection. This item is is passed, period.

All right, Alderman Kaplan moves to accept the substantive narrative plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that motion. Hearing none, the substantive narrative plans are in front of us.

Continue, Tyler.

[Speaker 5] (2:46:42 - 2:47:37)
The property is currently improved with a three story mixed use building, the applicant proposes adaptive reuse this existing building by adding a floor and making facade improvements to the building. To do so the applicant requests zoning change from the C one one two three zoning district. After rezoning the property will be improved with a mixed use building with the first two floors being built for commercial use the third floor, or a dwelling unit, and the fourth floor for a dwelling unit for a total of two dwelling units.

There'll be two indoor parking spaces provided with this application. Prior to this hearing the applicant met with Alderman Burnett, the neighbors of West Loop, the West Central Association, and the West Loop community organization who also were supportive of this project and I believe Alderman Burnett is available here to express his support for this project.

[Speaker 1] (2:47:39 - 2:47:49)
We do. Alderman Burnett, would you like to talk about the application on North Green Street, please. Mr. Chairman, as the counselor said he did meet with the local community organizations.

[Speaker 35] (2:47:50 - 2:47:51)
This is a minor change.

[Speaker 1] (2:47:52 - 2:47:54)
Walter, can you speak up a little bit you're a little faded.

[Speaker 35] (2:47:54 - 2:48:09)
This is a minor change considering what's been going on in this community. So it's sort of a no brainer for myself and all of the community organizations we don't see a problem with it. So we asked for the committee support with it.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:48:10 - 2:48:19)
Thank you Alderman. Any questions for the Alderman or the applicant. Hearing none, can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

So, all of them in Pat Dow moves to accept the substantive narrative plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to our motion. Hearing none the substitute narrative and plans are in front of us.

Tyler.

[Speaker 5] (2:49:42 - 2:50:59)
The property is currently improved with a two and a half story residential building containing three dwelling units. The owner recently discovered that the city is not recognizing the garden unit as a conforming unit, based on research into the properties history the applicant discovered that while city water records reflect three units existed here more than 50 years, the prior owner permit to repair fire damage. And within that building permit, he only listed to dwelling units.

And this happened about 15 years ago, through this rezoning the owner seeks to rezone this property from an RS three to an RT for zoning district, in order to reestablish the garden unit and city records, no changes are being proposed to the existing building. There's currently two garage parking spaces here those two garage parking spaces will will remain, this is outside the ADU pilot areas. Prior to this hearing, prior to this hearing the applicant met with Alderman Burnett and engaged in a community meeting with the West Humboldt neighbors who supported this rezoning and I believe Alderman Burnett is here to confirm his support for this particular project.

[Speaker 1] (2:51:00 - 2:51:05)
Thank you, Tyler. All of in Walter Burnett please. I'm Drake Avenue.

[Speaker 35] (2:51:05 - 2:51:33)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. You know, Mr. Chairman, honestly I think this, this rezoning will probably get fixed in a new ADU, but considering the fact that they're just trying to reuse the basement apartment. And the, we had a community meeting with the West Humboldt Park Development Councils and no one in the community had a problem with it.

Thank you, Mr. Chair.

[Speaker 3] (2:51:33 - 2:51:34)
Thank you Alderman.

Like the project before the applicant discovered that only four dwelling units were recognized at this property. When it went in for building permits to do some, some renovation work at the property.

The city's only recognizing for 12. The applicant seeks to rezone this property to an RT for zoning district which is a conforming zoning district for the six existing dwelling units, so that they all become conforming. No changes are being proposed to existing building, other than adding to parking spaces that correspond to the two dwelling units we are seeking to establish here for a total of five dwelling units at this property.

Prior to this hearing the applicant has worked with all the woman and engaged in her 33rd board community process which resulted in the older woman giving her letter of support for this project should be on file with the committee. As a result, I respectfully request this committee's favorable recommendation the reason for the 132 the 34 North Francisco from an RS three to RT for zoning district happy, happy to answer any questions.

And we're just seeking the change to see one to allow continuous use, there'll be no changes to the exterior of the building parking or any other parts of the building.

[Speaker 37] (2:55:54 - 2:55:54)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (2:55:56 - 2:55:57)

Applicant would like to develop a property with a new four story mixed use building containing two commercial spaces that grade six units above, and six onsite parking spaces. Mr Chairman, you know, this is a type one, I did submit drawings and the narrative.

Nothing's changed really from what I originally submitted but I just at least want to recognize that, you know, I did submit, you know, their plans. But there are no changes, no changes.

[Speaker 1] (2:58:06 - 2:58:09)

So, it was an old frame probably an old frame house on a double lot.

[Speaker 11] (2:58:55 - 2:59:18)
Yeah, so double lot what I think what happened is if you, if you know the property the house is set back all the way to the rear, and as well as the garage so there's a big front yard. So what I suspect at one point there was a front building so it was a multi improvement building, the front building. I'm not sure when it happened but probably was demolished at some point, and a single family remain in the rear for many years.

[Speaker 41] (2:59:19 - 2:59:19)
Yeah.

[Speaker 1] (2:59:20 - 2:59:27)

[Speaker 11] (3:02:25 - 3:02:48)
Yeah, and we're actually with this new project. Currently there's really no on site parking so with this new project we are establishing 14 parking spaces. The girls are not allowed to drive.

So the students don't drive to school. So it's purely for school purposes it's only for employees, faculty and staff. Okay.

Yeah. Okay.

[Speaker 25] (3:03:41 - 3:04:44)
Good afternoon Chairman. Members of the board for the record Colleen Doherty from cold pack law group on behalf of the applicants. DTL YKVA LLC.

The subject property 650 West Wright would is currently improved with a two story to dwelling unit property. The applicant is seeking an amendment from the current RT four to an RM five. In order to accommodate two additional floors adding one additional dwelling unit for the two additional floors would be duplexed.

There would also be an additional parking space added for the additional unit. This is a type one application. We have worked extensively with the older woman's office older woman, Smith, as well as the Park West Community Association, and the Chicago Historic Preservation Commission.

We do have a letter of support from older woman Smith. And I'd be happy to answer any questions, you may have.

[Speaker 1] (3:04:49 - 3:05:05)
I am pretty familiar with this block. We have someone from 43rd Ward all all the woman Smith or staff. All the men's Michelle Smith.

Michelle.

[Speaker 19] (3:05:05 - 3:05:07)
Yes, thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (3:05:07 - 3:05:08)
650 West right would be.

[Speaker 19] (3:05:15 - 3:06:13)
I apologize, Mr Chairman. Yes, we're in support of this this is actually a block that is almost entirely are five. And the the change of zoning in this neighborhood takes place in the couple of blocks adjoining this water.

So, this request is really very reasonable and very consistent with the other zoning in this immediate area. Plus, in contrast to other situations where a building like this would have been turned down torn down and turned into a modern three flat. The family has very much wanted to preserve the existing existing building.

So this is supported by our neighborhood groups, they've even consulted, they've consulted with the landmark commission. And we're actually pretty, we're actually quite happy with this outcome. And as for the support of the committee in allowing this upselling to occur.

[Speaker 1] (3:06:17 - 3:06:21)
All the woman how many units in this building. Great.

[Speaker 19] (3:06:21 - 3:06:25)
I believe it's going to, I think let's ask Council be sure I believe it's only going to be two.

[Speaker 1] (3:06:26 - 3:06:27)
And parking.

[Speaker 19] (3:06:30 - 3:06:33)
There's parking in the alley isn't that right. Council.

[Speaker 25] (3:06:33 - 3:06:51)
I'm sorry I just stepped in for I just stepped in from another meeting so the properties currently two units, it will become three, so the additional two stories will accommodate a 30 units and three total. And then yes there will be no additional parking space added for free parking spaces for free units.

[Speaker 1] (3:06:51 - 3:06:52)
Fantastic.

[Speaker 25] (3:06:52 - 3:06:53)
Yeah.

[Speaker 1] (3:06:53 - 3:07:05)
And I, I'm sure this is an owner occupied unit. Yes, whatever. Well, Alderman Alderman Smith you and I know this block very well.

[Speaker 41] (3:07:06 - 3:07:06)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (3:07:06 - 3:07:16)
This is one of the smallest buildings on that block, and it's a handsome building and kudos to the applicant and your office for preserving this building.

[Speaker 41] (3:07:17 - 3:07:18)
So, yeah.

[Speaker 1] (3:07:18 - 3:08:04)
Any questions, comments. Hearing none. Can I get a motion to move to pass by the same protocol that was used to determine quorum.

Passed by Alderman Wagesback makes that motion, any objection to his motion. Carrying on the item is passed. All right, that's, thank you very much.

Now we're moving on. Yep, bottom page 15. Document number 20816 47th Ward ordinance was referred on September 14 and 21 common addresses 4613 North Damon Avenue to change request from an RS three residential single unit detached house district to a B 2.15 neighborhood mixed use district. We have Megan Wade on this fall.

[Speaker 29] (3:08:06 - 3:09:38)
Hello, my name is Megan Wade and my husband David Trotter and I are the owners of 4613 North Damon. It's a two story four unit building that has a storefront commercial storefront with one apartment above, and then two apartments in the rear, and the three car garage. We purchased the building in late July with the intent to use the storefront as an office for our two businesses I'm a landscape architect and my husband is an architect late in the purchasing.

And then of course we're going to rent the, the other, there's three other units which we plan on just renting continuing to rent to the existing tenants late in the purchasing process, we learned that the zoning department no longer recognizes the storefront as a unit, because the previous owner rented it out as a residential unit for the past 20, 20 months and in doing so, all non conforming rights to use the storefront for commercial purposes were lost. Therefore, we are proposing to rezone the building to be 2.

I'm sorry, be to dash 1.5, which is the most restrictive option that allows the building to be in compliance with in its current state. We're not proposing any changes to the building, although we do plan to renovate the storefront facade of the local chamber of commerce says, and all the adjacent neighbor neighbors are in support of the change. And we are thankful that Alderman Martin also sent his letter of support in, and we are available for any questions that you have.

[Speaker 1] (3:09:39 - 3:10:09)
Thank you, Megan we do have a letter of support from Alderman Martin. Any questions comments from committee members. Hearing none, all the men walk us back makes motion do pass by the same roll call it was used to determine determine quorum.

Any objections to his motion. Hearing none, the item is cast, Megan. I'm also very familiar with this area of Damon so I it's going to be a nice rehab of these existing building so good luck to you.

[Speaker 37] (3:10:10 - 3:10:11)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:10:12 - 3:10:42)
Staying in the 47th war top page 16 document number 20815 t 147th board at common address 1744 through 1754 West Addison Street, also known as 3601 to 3613 North Ravenswood. The change request from a C one two neighborhood commercial district and RS three residential single unit detached house district, all to a be free free community shopping district. Andrew Scott.

[Speaker 14] (3:10:43 - 3:11:54)
Thank you very much, Mr Chairman members of the committee. For the record, my name is Andrew Scott here on behalf of the petitioner 3601 North Ravenswood LLC. Mr Chairman you did sum up the request to rezone very accurately it's proposing to rezone the subject property at the northeast corner of Addison and Ravenswood from the current zoning classification of C one two, and RS three to a B three three type one.

This is actually a pod project we're located within several hundred feet of the Addison Brown line stop. And so that's the nature of the development. The sites currently improved with single story commercial slash retail spaces and two two flat units, and the proposal is to demolish the existing improvements and do a mixed use development with 52 dwelling units to live work units on the ground floor 12 parking spaces and approximately 5500 square feet of retail.

And at this point, Mr Chairman, we did submit a substitute narrative and plans to staff, and I'd like those incorporated into the record.

[Speaker 1] (3:11:55 - 3:12:09)
So, Alderman Kaplan then moves to accept the substantive narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine form. Any objections to the motion. Hearing none.

The substantive narrative and plans are in front of us, you can continue.

[Speaker 14] (3:12:10 - 3:12:57)
Thank you, Mr Chairman. Just to follow on, we have had a very robust community process over the past several months. We've appeared before the Alderman Zoning Advisory Committee.

We've had a zoom community meeting where we had over 60 participants, we met with the Lakeview Roscoe Chamber of Commerce on several occasions. We have presented the West Lakeview neighbors and we've also met with our immediate neighbors to address all the concerns that were raised. And so, with all of that effort we're here today to ask for the favorable support, I believe you should have a letter of support, and also a commitment letter on behalf of developer on file with your office.

And I think I saw Alderman Martin on a little while ago but I'm available to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (3:12:57 - 3:13:06)
All right, we do have Alderman Martin on the call. Alderman Martin, would you like to talk about Ravenswood Addison, please.

[Speaker 17] (3:13:07 - 3:13:54)
Briefly and thank you Chairman, um, a few things that I would know and echoing what Mr Scott said about the community process I think they've done a very strong job in terms of reaching out to the immediate neighbors to the most active nearby neighborhood association, the Roscoe Village neighbors who support the project, working very closely as well with the Lakeview Roscoe Village Chamber of Commerce to incorporate a lot of their edits or their suggested that it's especially when it concerned commercial, and then finally working under the new arrow with the Department of Housing, or whereby there will be seven two bedroom units that will all be located on site which I think is is terrific and a reflection of what we've heard consistently from folks in West Lakeview and North Center which is more affordably priced family sized units.

[Speaker 1] (3:13:57 - 3:14:16)
All right, questions for the Alderman comments. Matt I've got a couple of questions on this. The existing is the existing plot of land as to single single resident homes and some kind of commercial building on it.

I'm not.

[Speaker 17] (3:14:17 - 3:14:34)
It's a commercial strip, many of the businesses have since closed and there's a raven. Yeah, and then on Addison I think to either single family homes and or two flats but but Mr Scott might be able to speak more to those.

[Speaker 1] (3:14:35 - 3:14:47)
All right, well that's, I mean it is what it is you're building a fairly large building transit oriented development. The it is commercial on the going to be on the ground floor.

[Speaker 14] (3:14:48 - 3:14:49)
That's correct. Yes.

[Speaker 1] (3:14:49 - 3:14:55)
Oh good. Okay, because I thought I heard live work units but maybe that was a different there are going to be, there are going to be live work units.

[Speaker 14] (3:14:56 - 3:15:01)
Okay, but we'll have to go to the zoning Board of Appeals for a special use for those. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (3:15:01 - 3:15:17)
And then on the new arrow. Do the math here you have 52 units. Seven, two bedrooms is that does that fully comply with the with this based on the size of the unit.

[Speaker 14] (3:15:18 - 3:15:50)
So I think Alderman Martin may have understated our commitment. We have in fact agreed to seven, two bedrooms, one one bedroom, and we're going to buy out the balance 1.4 1.4 what million. No, I'm sorry 1.4. So, that gets you to, so we would have an obligation of 10 with 52 units that gets you to 10.4. And you would round down on the number 10.4 units.

[Speaker 1] (3:15:50 - 3:15:51)
Okay.

[Speaker 14] (3:15:51 - 3:15:57)
So you have you round down in terms of the hard units that you have to provide but you still have to buy out the point for.

[Speaker 1] (3:15:57 - 3:16:21)
Okay, well wait a second. That 10 units required 1010 units are required, except for this point for let's get the point for for a second, seven two bedrooms and one one bedroom. That's correct.

And then, and then tell me the what the remaining party goes again, the buying out of the remaining one.

[Speaker 11] (3:16:25 - 3:16:27)
How about two, three. That's right.

[Speaker 1] (3:16:27 - 3:16:34)
Well to know seven, seven and one is a, you're absolutely right we are.

[Speaker 14] (3:16:35 - 3:16:44)
Our numbers are off by 17. You're right, we're off by one.

[Speaker 1] (3:16:46 - 3:17:10)
All right, so you'd have to buy out 1.4 unit. We have anybody on the department on this one, or they're at the White Sox game already. Yes.

All right, Alderman Alderman Martin. Matt. Yes, you'll double check on all this.

[Speaker 17] (3:17:10 - 3:17:36)
We worked very closely with Ricardo Lopez and we'll follow up to ensure that, especially given the fact that there are more two bedroom units than what would typically be concerning here that the math designers stand that there's additional credit that's provided when you do more family size units than what would typically be required given the unit mix so we'll follow up with him and make sure.

[Speaker 14] (3:17:36 - 3:18:21)
That's exactly it Mr chairman I apologize, Alderman you're correct, Alderman Martin you're correct. Because the mix would have tip the typical mix would have required five bedroom units let's just say we weren't going to do. You know we just did the straight, based on the percentage of the types of units that we had in the building.

The new arrow allows you to get a 1.25 credit for a two bedroom unit forever and relative to a one bedroom unit so essentially what we did is instead of providing five one bedrooms which would have been the straight application. We're doing for two bedrooms. So that takes out the fifth one bedroom.

[Speaker 1] (3:18:23 - 3:18:56)
Okay, this is all works we are this is this extensive. So it's a new ordinance, we're all trying to navigate it and apply, you know, you know just interesting questions will probably have more of these, as we, as we have more, more development under the new arrow. So, as long as the Alderman is okay with departments okay with it, which I believe we're okay and we have his letter of support.

That's all my questions and comments.

[Speaker 14] (3:18:56 - 3:18:58)
Apologies for the confusion.

[Speaker 1] (3:18:59 - 3:19:57)
Any, any other committee members want to chime in, or if not, can I get a motion to move to pass by the same role Paul was used to determine quorum move to pass Alderman wagus back. No. All right.

The motion. The motion was moved by Alderman wagus back. Any objections to the motion.

Hearing on the item is passed with a substantive narrative and plants. All right, we're going to stay in the 47th Ward, and we are going to page 19. Document number 2075 71 in the 47th Ward again ordinance was referred on June 23 or 21 common address is 2250 through 2258 West Irving Park Road, and the change request from the two three neighborhood mixed use district and a B one one neighborhood shopping district, all to a B three three community shopping district.

And we have Katrina McGuire on this one.

[Speaker 38] (3:19:57 - 3:20:24)
Good afternoon, Mr Chairman members of the committee. It's a pleasure to be with you this afternoon. Again, yes, Katrina McGuire from Thompson Coburn, for the record here on behalf of the applicant land rush holding LLC.

This is a type one application as noted and we, there was a substitute set of plans and ordinance that was submitted some time ago. We would just ask that that substitute ordinance and narrative be incorporated here and all the men.

[Speaker 1] (3:20:24 - 3:20:40)
Marie Haddon moves to accept the substantive narrative and plans for the type one application by the same role to determine quorum. Any objections to her motion. Hearing none, the substantive narrative and plans are in front of us, continue Katrina.

[Speaker 38] (3:20:40 - 3:21:17)
Thank you. This is a five story building with 39 units proposed on the second through the fifth floors commercial uses on the ground floor 19 parking spaces as well as 42 bicycle parking spaces. This is a project that has been through several reiterations or iterations rather and major modifications that were made.

Several meetings, including with North Center Chamber of Commerce, and the North Center Neighborhood Association both organizations which do support the project. I know that Alderman Martin is here and we do enjoy his support as well. So with that, I would be happy to turn this over to Alderman Martin.

[Speaker 1] (3:21:18 - 3:21:22)
Hey, Alderman Martin on the Irving Park application please.

[Speaker 17] (3:21:22 - 3:22:24)
Yeah, I'll say two or three things. One. This is the site of some members may recall the old Chicago Joe's restaurant which closed some number of months ago.

Our my office as well as the Chamber of Commerce did separate visioning studies along the corridor in the neighborhood more generally, the desire to have restaurants and if possible family friendly restaurants was was brought up repeatedly. So we have a commitment to have this be a black iron ready and talks are underway with a potential restaurant tour. Also, happy that the eight affordable units will all be located on site, eight of the 39 and then the fact that through different iterations.

We went through five two bedroom units to 14 two bedroom units again to accommodate the fact that many families are moving into the North Center community, so I would, I would appreciate the committee's favorable consideration. All right.

[Speaker 1] (3:22:25 - 3:22:30)
Thank you, Matt. I'm sorry maybe I wasn't listening is this to D.

[Speaker 17] (3:22:31 - 3:22:34)
It is with Western with Western Avenue nearby.

[Speaker 1] (3:22:35 - 3:22:38)
Okay, great. And the number of parking spaces.

[Speaker 41] (3:22:39 - 3:22:40)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:22:40 - 3:23:14)
Okay, I'm Katrina it's been a long day. Sorry, I know you said that I think in your narrative. All right, questions, comments from many members.

If not, can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum alderman Kaplan makes that motion to pass any objections to his motion. Hearing none, the item is passed. Thank you, as with the substantive narrative implants.

[Speaker 41] (3:23:14 - 3:23:15)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:23:16 - 3:24:12)
Okay, now we're moving back. We're done with 47th Ward I believe we're in the bottom of page 16. Document number tool 783 in the second ward ordinances referred on July 21 of 21 common addresses 1546 through 1556 North Clark Street, 100 through 129 West North Avenue and 1555 through 1565 North LaSalle street.

The change request residential business plan development number 1272 to residential business plan development number 1272 as amended. Jack George. Mr. George. I need to unmute jack.

[Speaker 18] (3:24:15 - 3:24:15)
Can you hear me.

[Speaker 1] (3:24:16 - 3:24:18)
We can't hear you now.

[Speaker 18] (3:24:18 - 3:24:20)
You can hear me or not you can.

[Speaker 1] (3:24:20 - 3:24:23)
We can hear you loud and clear jack.

[Speaker 18] (3:24:23 - 3:25:34)
Thank you Mr Chairman sorry for the problem. My name is Jack George I'm an attorney with offices 71 South Walker I'm here this afternoon on behalf of the applicant which is 1515 North Clark Street LLC. Mr Chairman members of the committee this property is at 1515 North Clark Street, there are two sub areas sub area a and sub area B.

This was previously approved as a PD for residential condominium project which is now up and built. What we're seeking to do today is to amend plan development number 1272 to permit a veterinarian office on the first floor. As you can see on the rendering up there the building that's right on the corner there is a new building that was put up.

What we're seeking to do is just to have the veterinarian office on the first floor. When I did this PD originally we didn't have that as a permitted use. That's now a use that we need to have done.

So all we're seeking by this amendment is to have that permitted and I would ask at this time Mr Chairman. This was before the plan commission on September the 16th, and I would ask that the report of proceedings and exhibits that were part of the proceedings. Before the plan commission be incorporated into and made as a part of the proceedings before you today.

[Speaker 1] (3:25:35 - 3:25:50)
All right, I'm going to make a motion to incorporate those documents, all the men walk expect makes motion to incorporate the records from the planning commission by the same roll call that was used to determine form. Any objections to his motion. Hearing none the records are incorporated.

Continue.

[Speaker 18] (3:25:51 - 3:26:07)
This is, this is a, this is an Alderman Hopkins ward. He, as I understand it, he's in support of this project that's what was said before the plan commission. And so I would ask for a favorable recommendation on this matter and I stand ready to answer any questions that any of you might have concerning the project.

[Speaker 1] (3:26:10 - 3:26:17)
Any questions, comments committee members. Brian Hopkins Alderman Hopkins.

[Speaker 20] (3:26:18 - 3:26:53)
Thank you, Mr Chairman. The only concern raised by the community was that this facility would potentially board animals and that will not happen. There will be no boarding of dogs or cats or any other animals this is for treatment of animals who are ill or injured only.

So it's not a boarding facility it's a veterinary treatment facility. And there's a lot of dogs and cats in Sanford village. So, this is needed, and it's a most welcome use for most of the residents that we talked to.

So with no objection, I would move to pass.

[Speaker 1] (3:26:54 - 3:27:07)
Thank you, Brian busy corner. I know a lot of people are walking but interesting to see the loading and unloading on this facility there's parking on this one too or no.

[Speaker 18] (3:27:07 - 3:27:13)
There is parking but it's not part of this we're not we don't have any additional parking for these for this veterinarian use.

[Speaker 1] (3:27:14 - 3:27:17)
That's a corner from the history museum correct.

[Speaker 18] (3:27:17 - 3:27:33)
That's, that's correct. That's, that's correct. And Alderman happens is correctly, we are not going to have any overnight boarding services allowed.

This is only for sick animals and we're doing making no other changes to sub area a under this amendment. Yeah.

[Speaker 20] (3:27:33 - 3:27:41)
And Mr Chairman there's a pre existing loading zone, and there is metered parking down on Clark Street and also on North.

[Speaker 1] (3:27:41 - 3:27:48)
Great. Alrighty. Well, Mr George will you you were the attorney on this original PD correct.

[Speaker 18] (3:27:49 - 3:27:51)
Yes, I am I was, I was the one.

[Speaker 1] (3:27:51 - 3:28:08)
Yeah, well this one will go a lot smoother than the original. I think I was on a planning commission I think I've entertained this corner used to be, as my staff tells me used to be a famous little restaurant on that corner. There was a once it was a one story building about.

[Speaker 18] (3:28:09 - 3:28:11)
You're right. Good memory.

[Speaker 1] (3:28:11 - 3:28:16)
Yeah. Alrighty. And of course we all miss the village theater right that's the one, one next to it.

[Speaker 18] (3:28:16 - 3:28:18)
We all do. That's right.

[Speaker 1] (3:28:19 - 3:28:39)
All right. Any other comments, questions, if not, can I get a motion move to pass by the roll call to determine quorum move to pass over Hopkins move to pass on this item any objections to his motion. Hearing on the item is passed as revised.

[Speaker 18] (3:28:40 - 3:28:41)
Thanks very much.

[Speaker 1] (3:28:41 - 3:29:11)
All right, top of page 17 document number 2131 in the 11th board ordinance was referred on July 24 of 19 common addresses 505 through 507 West route street, and the change request residential single unit detached house district to a C one dash 1.5 neighborhood commercial district. Rich talk is on the call, I believe.

[Speaker 9] (3:29:22 - 3:29:22)
Yeah.

[Speaker 1] (3:29:28 - 3:29:32)
All right, Mr talk you want on mute or try to get on the call please.

[Speaker 26] (3:29:34 - 3:30:50)
Sorry about that. Thank you. Thank you, Chairman.

Good afternoon Chairman tiny members of the zoning committee. My name is Richard Tom. I'm an attorney appearing on behalf of the applicant and property owner, Bracken Management Inc.

Regarding application numbers you said 2131, which does seek a zoning change from RS three to see one dash 1.5. The property is a one story building takes up about half the lot. It had historically been used for commercial purposes, it was historically used as a small trucking company site. The rezoning will facilitate some planned improvements in the properties intended to host small events, such as fundraisers charitable events and meetings.

Alderman Thompson had hosted a community meeting to allow the applicant to present the project. As a result, Alderman Thompson was kind enough to provide a letter of support for the project. I believe and hope that you have a copy of that letter of support.

We will be following up to seek separate approvals from the CPA related to parking and other licensing. Otherwise, subject to the approval of the zoning change use and density parameters will comply with the Chicago zoning ordinance, and we would request your favorable recommendation.

[Speaker 1] (3:30:52 - 3:31:05)
A letter of support from Alderman Thompson. Just a quick question. Since this was applied in July of 19.

Was there a lot of community process on this or what.

[Speaker 26] (3:31:06 - 3:31:24)
There was there was in part there was some issues to resolve with the neighbors but in part there was some some working on getting off site, off site parking location, which has been done, and it just took the slow boat I'll say, maybe COVID was a part of that as well.

[Speaker 1] (3:31:24 - 3:31:30)
Okay, but the total according to my application, eight parking spaces.

[Speaker 26] (3:31:31 - 3:31:51)
So the site itself could fit about a we're probably going to shift that off site there's a, there's a site about two blocks away at 4001 south normal, it's got over 50 parking spaces it's used during the daytime. This particular venue will be more of an evening event. So, so that site will be used again over 50 parking spaces.

[Speaker 1] (3:31:52 - 3:33:02)
All right, just for clarification. Okay. Any other questions, comments.

All right, Alderman hadn't makes a motion move to pass by the roll call the established quorum. Any objections to her motion, hearing on the item is is passed. Thank you.

Thank you. All right, bottom of page 17. Document number 2070 to 28th Ward ordinance was referred on May 26 to 21 common addresses 1401 through 1555 West Congress Parkway 500 to 532 South Loomis Avenue 1400 through 1554 West Harrison Street and 501 through 531 South Ashland change request institutional plan development number 168 as amended to see three five commercial manufacturing employment district, then to institutional plan development number 168, as amended. Carol Stubblefield please on this.

[Speaker 12] (3:33:03 - 3:34:02)
Thank you, Mr Chairman and members of the committee for the record Carol Stubblefield with Neil Roy offices at 20 South Clark here on behalf of the applicant rush University Medical Center with me on the call today to answer any questions our members from the rush development team, our project architects and our traffic consultants. The applicant is proposing to amend PD 168 to include hospital as a permitted use to facilitate the development of an acute care hospital for inpatient physical rehab services. The amendment will also seek to rezone the entire plan development to an underlying see three five to permit high rise signage on the adjacent route Schlager ambulatory building.

That was the prior PD amendment that is currently under construction now. This project was heard and unanimously approved at the September 16 2021 Chicago Plan Commission. We do ask that the findings and conclusions of the Chicago Plan Commission all documents given to the Department of Planning and Development be adopted into today's record.

[Speaker 1] (3:34:03 - 3:34:15)
All the men walk us back moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that. Hearing on the records are incorporated continue Carol.

[Speaker 12] (3:34:15 - 3:35:32)
All right, thank you so much. The project is located in the near west side community area and is bounded by Congress Parkway Ashland Avenue Harrison Street and Lomas Street. The new hospital will be five stories and approximately 93 feet to the top of the penthouse, it will be approximately 135,000 square feet, including the mechanical penthouse space and have 70 surface parking spaces.

Rush has complied with all notice requirements and obtained the required approvals from CEDAW, FIRE, and MOPD. The project will comply with the city's sustainability policy and stormwater management. The applicant also plans to meet the city's goal for inclusion and diversity.

After approval construction is anticipated to start in the first quarter of 2022 and be completed in the second quarter of 2023. The project will create approximately 1000 temporary construction jobs, and once completed and operational, it will add approximately 320 permanent jobs. The development team has presented the project to the community and has the support of alderman urban who I believe was in attendance earlier today at committee.

We do have his support for this amendment and the project, and we'd be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (3:35:34 - 3:35:54)
Carol we do have a letter of support from all of an urban on this project. Obviously it's going through plan commission. The one thing that you mentioned that I would like to identify, where is this rough signage, where you is it going to be on this building itself.

[Speaker 12] (3:35:55 - 3:36:22)
The high rise signage. This is not first I don't think this new building would qualify as a high rise building for high rise signage. So that high rise signage would go on the new ambulatory building, the roof slugger building that is to the west of this so if we can, yeah, if you stop here and see the roof slugger building on that southwest corner of the site.

And that's where the high rise signage would go there.

[Speaker 1] (3:36:23 - 3:36:59)
So the infamous new building that oddly shaped but a very attractive building that's where you're going to put signage on. Correct. All right.

Um, I don't have any other, but if you're doing see what is it you're doing a C three five. You said, in order to permit signage, but this is the only intended signage even though the whole PD is three five. The only signage would be on this marquee building that's already built.

It's under construction right now.

[Speaker 12] (3:37:00 - 3:37:26)
Correct. Because high rise signage I don't have the definition in front of me but it's a certain elevation it's a certain height of a building that renders you a high rise high rise signage. Our building being 93 feet I don't think triggers that it is not our expectation to request high rise signage for the new acute care facility.

Okay.

[Speaker 1] (3:37:27 - 3:37:34)
Yeah, I mean, there's different zoning heights and building heights you know I believe high rise. I don't know what that number would be.

[Speaker 41] (3:37:36 - 3:37:37)
But, yeah.

[Speaker 1] (3:37:38 - 3:38:01)
All right. Any other questions, comments. Hearing none.

Can I get a motion move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine form. Alderman blog is back makes the motion. Any objections to his motion.

Hearing none of the items. This item is passed as revised.

[Speaker 12] (3:38:01 - 3:38:03)
Thank you, Mr Chairman committee.

[Speaker 1] (3:38:03 - 3:38:04)
All right, good luck to you.

[Speaker 12] (3:38:05 - 3:38:05)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:38:22 - 3:40:03)
Moving on to the top of page 18 document number 20574 in the 40th Ward ordinance was referred on December 16 of 2020. These addresses, how many addresses starting with 2645 to 27. I'm sorry, 2645 through 2759 West Foster 2716 through 2760 West Foster 2801 through 2859 West Foster 2826 through 2836 West Foster 5101 through 5159 North Francisco 5100 through 5158 North California Avenue 2724 through 2758 West Winona Avenue 2739 through 2759 West Winona Avenue 2800 through 2858 West Winona Avenue and 2801 through 2851, I would assume, West Winona Avenue.

The change request RS three residential single unit detached house district to see one five neighborhood commercial district and see one five neighborhood commercial district to residential institutional plan development number 92 as amended and designated as sub area be and designating a sub area a portion of residential institution plan development number 92 found a map, 13 one, we better have some slides on this. I don't know what I just wrote wrote into the record here.

Alright, so we have Graham Grady on this.

[Speaker 8] (3:40:04 - 3:45:52)
Good afternoon Chairman tiny Can you hear me. We can. Thank you chairman and members of the committee on zoning.

My name is Graham Grady and along with my colleagues Sylvia Mike is it's our pleasure to represent Swedish covenant hospital doing business as Swedish hospital. With regard to this application. Hearing none.

The records are incorporated continue. Thank you very much. Available to answer questions today are Marcia Jimenez the director of government affairs at Swedish and David Dastar of Jensen and Halsey, the project architect.

First we'd like to thank all the men Vasquez and his staff for his leadership and a highly effective community meeting early on in the process for this important community asset that we're asking the committee to review and approve today we'd also like to thank staff, the Department of Planning and Development, and see that, and other agencies as well. In particular, we'd like to thank first deputy commissioner, Claudia harassment of the Department of Planning and Development who actually made a site visit to this location, and who also provided information and insight on the design of the building that you will see, and we'd like to thank Commissioner and others. If we could take a look here.

This is an amendment to plan development 92 which is the area shaded in white. We propose to add the area shaded in orange which is on the north side of Foster Avenue. In order to build a new seven story medical office building, which will be a tremendous addition to the Swedish hospital campus.

The orange square that you see there is currently zoned RS three. It is our intention to rezone that square to see one five, and also rezone the entire white shaded area of PD 92. Also to see one dash five.

In addition, we then seek to create two sub areas sub area, a which will be the white area which is the existing Swedish campus, and then sub area B for the new building, which is shown in the orange square. If we can go to the next slide please. This shows the terrific rendering the beautiful architecture the great design of this building, which is totally in keeping with the very recent foster medical pavilion which you can see in the upper right hand corner in the distance.

The two buildings compliment each other very well, and signify the advanced architectural design that Swedish is incorporating into it into its campus. As I mentioned, this is a seven story medical office building, which will contain approximately 4200 square feet of medical office space 32 interior parking spaces on floors two and three medical outpatient facility on floors four through seven, and approximately 9000 square foot green roof atop the building. Here you can see the site plan, as well as the interior interior layout.

There will be bike racks both in on the inside of the building for staff and customers and patients rather as well as a few bike racks along the street. The building of course is fully accessible has been reviewed by MOPD fire prevention stormwater. All the other agencies that get us to this point.

We have a loading area off of the alley. And this location is extremely well served by public transit there are buses on both foster, as well as California. If we can go to the, to the next slide.

Here you can see the building to the left in the foreground on the north side of foster and I mentioned the, the existing foster medical billion which is up, up into the right. The project has been enhanced by comments from the Department of Planning and Development. We have relocated the entrance a little bit further away from the driveway intake and ingress and egress, and we've made other enhancements to the facade of the building.

In addition, as a part of our discussions with the Department of Planning and Development, Swedish will engage in a massive tree planting program in which they will plant on their campus 20 new trees, each year for each of the next three years, adding a total of 60 trees to this already. Sylvan and bucolic health care campus. We are happy to answer any questions that you may have.

I know many of you are familiar with the Swedish covenant hospital campus. Swedish, as you may know, has provided tremendous aid to the city throughout the COVID crisis with providing testing and vaccinations, health care information to many, many Chicago residents, including many residents who are able to pay for health care services. Swedish has a tremendous record of providing medical care services to the community, not just those who live in the immediate vicinity, but throughout Chicagoland.

We're happy to answer any questions that you may have. Again, we'd like to thank Alderman Vasquez and all the city agencies that have gotten us to this point on this project.

[Speaker 1] (3:45:52 - 3:46:41)
Thank you, Graham. Thank you. Alderman Vasquez has a support letter this went to plan commission.

I think, obviously it's a great, great hospital institution, and, you know, they've got a great Miss Jimenez, you know, I want to give her a shout out. She's been a former city employee and I know she's done really good work with the hospital so and continues to advise us on all things Swedish, which you know I have a soft spot for that to begin with. So, that being said, questions, comments from committee members.

Hearing none. Can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine form.

[Speaker 41] (3:46:42 - 3:46:44)
Move to pass Alderman Wagesback.

Initially, we had filed an application to change the zoning from our three to our m 5.4, but at the request of the alderman, we're asking to amend this to a type one map amendment with plans.

[Speaker 1] (3:48:31 - 3:48:49)
So you're asking this application to go from 20642 to 20642 T, meaning type of one. He won. All right.

All right. Department on a roadways.

[Speaker 38] (3:48:50 - 3:49:03)
We're good with this motion on that, as I stated, yes chairman I did receive narrative and plans to amend the original to a type one. Okay, not.

[Speaker 1] (3:49:04 - 3:49:32)
This is not a amendment to the ordinance. That's the type one. All right.

Okay, so can get, can I get a motion, move to pass as a type one by the same role call it was used to determine form. So mobile to make Cardona, or Alderman Cardona makes the motion any objection to the motion. Hearing none.

Right. Gerald we do have a letter of support based on the type one application from all the minimal style. And given your narrative I'm sure it reflects with the department what you just said about FAR hyphen and such.

That being said, I think we're being any comments or questions from committee members hearing on can I get a motion to move to pass.

[Speaker 41] (3:51:06 - 3:51:06)

Yeah, right.

[Speaker 1] (3:51:47 - 3:52:45)
We got one clerical correction to do, and this is on page one, and the Illinois Medical District, which was application, a 8728 Illinois Medical District with those boundaries. We did not incorporate the plans from the plan commission. So, we need to go back to that, and I read it into the record.

Again, this is the Illinois Medical District on Ashland Paulina Damon and such. All right, all of them in August back moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same role call it was used to determine quorum.

Any objections to that motion. All right. With that, then let's get a second motion just to approve that application.
