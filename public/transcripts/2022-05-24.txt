And our first speaker, Blanca Torres. Blanca?

[Speaker 36] (8:13 - 8:14)
Hello, yes.

[Speaker 12] (8:15 - 8:15)
Can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (8:16 - 8:17)
Yes, we can.

[Speaker 12] (8:17 - 11:23)
Would you identify yourself for the record and speak to us? My name is Blanca Torres, and I'm a longtime parishioner of St. Adalbert. I live on the block and a half away from the property, which is under ordinance 02019-5785 MAP 4H for reclassification from RT4 to POS4.

I support the downzoning of the property of the former parish of St. Adalbert. We want to ensure through this downzoning effort that the whole community of Tulsan, former parishioners and their area residents have a say in what happens in this special place. Our altar person, Byron Sitchko-Lopez, understood our concerns and listened to what we had to say.

I am also part of the St. Adalbert Preservation Society, a nonprofit started to make certain the parishioners of St. Adalbert had a voice in what happened in their church. We have sought to keep our church open through the last six years when the effort to consolidate the churches started in Tulsan back in 2016. Whatever happens at this property is of paramount importance to the efforts to keep our community vital, engaged and diverse.

To be in a society, we need to hear from all sides concerned. This measure is being done to ensure that right of the community. Especially in these times of difficulty, we need to have positive and enforcing anchors to the community, places of refuge and education.

We need to have places to help in the process of community building and not tearing down. This is vitally important in a place like Tulsan who is at a crucible of their history in how we go forward to have a neighborhood that is fully participatory to a new and old generations alike. I also stand as a representative with the greater family of the St. Adalbert community who put their all in their church. Some say it is only a building and that people are what make a community. But buildings were built by these very special people. Some buildings weren't saving to enhance and provide enlightenment, to have succor and respite, to bring everyone together.

We went to school here, we got married here. We did all of what we had in our community, we did it here. We looked, my parents who were such people, they had worked hard within their parish to build a community that was strong and vital.

My father who passed, I remember being in the church and that was one of my first memories. He has now passed, but as so many others who have worked for this community, but they would want us to keep this place in the heart of Pilsen, beating and forever going strong for future generations to come in whatever form the community decides. Thank you.

[Speaker 36] (11:25 - 11:28)
Thank you, our next speaker is Ward Miller.

[Speaker 13] (11:35 - 11:38)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman, can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (11:38 - 11:41)
We can, would you identify yourself for the record please?

[Speaker 10] (11:42 - 14:49)
Sure, I'm Ward Miller, Executive Director of the nonprofit organization Preservation Chicago. And we're always grateful to this committee and your support of our landmarks and historic buildings throughout the city of Chicago, including those buildings which one day may be considered for Chicago landmark designation. Today, we are before you to ask that you consider and support the proposed down zoning of the former St. Adelbert's Roman Catholic Church located at 1650 West 17th Street in the Pilsen community. As many of you know, this Basilica Church designed by one of Chicago's finest ecclesiastical architects, Henry Schlax has been on our Preservation Chicago, Chicago seven most endangered list for many years. The church was closed and deconsecrated in 2019 by its owner and this has led to a great partnership of architects, preservationists, historians, parishioners, community members and people of all different ethnicities to come together to encourage the building be preserved, landmarked and protected from an uncertain future and the potential of demolition. The church building modeled after St. Paul's outside the walls in Rome is a magnificent structure and with its identical 185 foot towers is the tallest building in the Pilsen community. The building is also a cornerstone of the community since 1914 along with its predecessor structure since 1874 and its closure and reduction by its owner to quote unquote profane but not sorted use was a sad day for many of us and for our city. Collectively many of us are of the opinion that St. Adelbert's should be preserved. This extends to both the exterior and the magnificent interior and all of its features and furnishings and we want to encourage a down zoning of the buildings and site in order to better control possible reuse options.

One of these from the community members, former parishioners and stakeholders includes a proposal to retain the building as a sacred site and chapel for the community. This plan would also encourage the building not be sold to the highest bidder but thoughtfully support the community's wishes. Please remember that these structures were built with pennies, nickels and dimes of a community of faith and gifted to the current owners, in this case the Archdiocese of Chicago to maintain staff and protect in perpetuity.

Often as we see these days, that promise is not honored and the spirit of the gift is not maintained. So we would therefore like to support the down zoning of the site proposed by Alderman Ciccio-Lopez to continue the dialogue and robust conversations between the greater community of members, former parishioners, stakeholders and the current owners. We at Preservation Chicago also want to encourage the Chicago landmark designation of St. Albert's.

[Speaker 30] (14:56 - 14:58)
Chairman, you're muted chairman.

[Speaker 1] (14:59 - 15:01)
Oh, I'm sorry. Our next speaker, Margo Duhamel.

[Speaker 16] (15:04 - 15:05)
Hi, can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (15:05 - 15:08)
We can, identify yourself for the record please.

[Speaker 16] (15:09 - 18:11)
Hi, I am Margo Konechni-Duhamel. My family has lived on 17th street for over 110 years. I lived at 1655 West 17th street and attended St. Albert's school. My grandfather, Joseph Konechni worked as a bricklayer's assistant and helped place the bricks in the tower. St. Albert church has immense historical significance spiritual and architectural significance for the city of Chicago, excuse me, and the world. And I would put it on a global scale.

I have traveled throughout Europe and have been to many churches, synagogues and sacred places and St. Albert's is up there with all of them. It is the finest example of Polish diaphora architecture considered by the university of Lublin Poland in 2016. They did a survey of all the churches in America and St. Albert was the first church they visited when they came. It is an irreplaceable church in terms of the immigration history in Pilsen bringing in the Polish and the Mexican communities and being such a heartbeat for that community. In terms of architecture, it has, it is irreplaceable. It wouldn't, it would cost more than a hundred million dollars to build something like this right now.

It has a Tiffany stained glass half dome. It has a 13 ton career marble altar. It has over 14 or 16 four-story marble pillars eight granite pillars and a marble copy of Michelangelo's Pieta, which I don't know how much that weighs, probably five tons or something.

And at the point right now, it's in grave, grave danger. The Archdiocese of Chicago wants to cannibalize the church. Obviously they want to tear it down and sell it to the highest bidder and put condos up there.

They have a plan right now to move the marble Pieta out of St. Adalbert's into St. Paul that is posted on the St. Paul's website. I don't, they'd have to tear a wall down to get that out. So it's just, it's very, I mean, it's just a treasure and it's an inconceivable thought to see that this church would be destroyed.

This building would be destroyed. It's at the level of the Stock Exchange of the Garrick Theater and it could be and will be an engine of economics for the neighborhood.

[Speaker 1] (18:13 - 18:16)
All right, our next speaker, Jurek Jablonski.

[Speaker 30] (18:19 - 18:23)
Chairman, I don't see Jurek Jablonski here.

[Speaker 1] (18:25 - 18:29)
All right, we'll give it a pass. Next speaker, Julie Sawicki.

[Speaker 11] (18:36 - 21:42)
Good morning, Alderman. My name is Julie Sawicki and I'm here today to ask you to vote yes for the down zoning proposed by 25th Ward Alderman Byron Ciccio-Lopez for the St. Adalbert site at 1650 West 17th Street. It's no secret that Pilsen has been fighting the pressures of gentrification for decades.

Yes, housing is needed, but it is needed citywide. And there is a lot of vacant land everywhere. I am in real estate, so I understand and appreciate real estate development, but not here.

Progress is not trampling over a site that is cherished by two of the largest immigrant communities in the city and the Pilsen community. St. Adalbert is the pride of Kelowna and a testament to the contributions of our immigrant ancestors. Progress is not bastardizing a church by gutting it and putting condos in it.

This idea is even distasteful to non-Catholics. While the history and architecture of St. Adalbert is illustrious and inarguable, Alderman, you may be wondering about its future. Who will maintain the church and the site and what will become of it?

For the past five years, we've been collaborating with the St. Adalbert stakeholders to develop a plan that respects all, first and foremost, those of the parishioners, the Catholic faithful of St. Adalbert and those who built it and sustained it for over 140 years. With all considerations in mind, it was important for us to develop a long-term plan that was viable and achievable and then one that honored its original purpose as closely as possible. The core of our plan includes designating the church as a shrine to St. Adalbert as there is none in the United States and to convert the convent into a B&B style retreat house. The beauty of this plan is that the retreat house would serve as a primary revenue generator to sustain this site long-term. We wouldn't have to rely on perpetual fundraising or government funds. Faith-based tourism is a $20 billion industry in the U.S. alone and St. Adalbert has been featured in Chicago's open house program for several years and it has attracted tourism. Preservation Chicago has listed it several times as one of the most endangered sites in Chicago. This type of plan would not only create jobs in the neighborhood, but it would drive the economy in the neighborhood as well. It would also provide a budget to do meaningful community programming and in our current state of affairs in Chicago, we need solutions.

We are in crisis and for the solution, it's all hands on deck. We are disappointed that the Archdiocese of Chicago doesn't see an opportunity here to be part of the solution in our neighborhoods and is instead shutting our churches and having a fight.

[Speaker 1] (21:46 - 21:48)
Our next speaker is Chris Waz.

[Speaker 30] (21:57 - 22:13)
Chris Waz, please. Chris Waz, please press star six on your phone to unmute. All right.

Is that Chris? Good morning. Can you hear me now?

[Speaker 1] (22:13 - 22:16)
We can. Identify yourself for the record, please.

[Speaker 19] (22:17 - 25:02)
Christopher Waz. I've been involved for the last few years in an effort to save St. Adalbert Church. As we already heard from several speakers, so well articulated arguments for preserving this incredible site.

I applaud the Alderman Cedric Lopez for his effort to down zone the site and I fully support it. I would like to point out especially to the social aspect. We all know all the social troubles in the city, shootings and all this.

And a large contributor to this crisis is the uprooting of the people. And this striking visible sign of the heritage of people inhabiting the neighborhood, the Polish immigrants and then the Mexican immigrants and the peaceful transition from one community to the other community, taking over as we heard from Lanka, Mexicans moving into the neighborhood and finding their home in the parish. These are wonderful stories and the church will be the visible sign of history, of belonging to this place for the two largest immigrant communities in the city.

And it really will contribute that sense of belonging, of continuity. These are the building blocks of social cohesion and certainly will help our city to become integrated, to become peaceful and people possessing a sense of belonging to this place. So just for that reason alone, we should work toward preserving the St. Adalbert. And again, I'm very grateful for the Alderman to have this motion to down zone the St. Adalbert and let's hope that we'll succeed. Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (25:03 - 25:10)
Thank you. Our next speaker, Margaret Januszewski. I hope I got that halfway right.

Margaret.

[Speaker 30] (25:15 - 25:36)
Margaret, please press star six on your phone to unmute. Hello. Yes, we can hear you.

Hello. You can proceed. You press star six again, you got muted.

Please press star six just one time. One more time.

[Speaker 1] (25:37 - 25:40)
Hello. Yes, we can hear you.

[Speaker 17] (25:41 - 25:43)
You can hear me?

[Speaker 1] (25:43 - 25:49)
We can. Hello. Are you, Margaret?

Margaret, would you proceed? Let's proceed with your testimony, please.

[Speaker 17] (25:50 - 28:55)
Okay. My name is Margaret Januszewski. I have a degree in urban planning and policy from the University of Illinois.

I am a member of Society of St. Adalbert and I'm really worried about the faith of the church. Okay. I will be talking from the perspective of urban planner.

St. Adalbert Church is a focal point for the whole Pilsen neighborhood. Why is it important? It gives, it provides sense of settlement to the people.

It means clarity with which the area can be perceived and identified. Identify. Okay.

So identity is provided. Identity provided by the church is translated to this. People have an experience of being in a very special place.

And I would like to quote Kevin Lynch in that aspect. Okay. So Kevin Lynch says, the direct enjoyment of the vivid perception is enlarged because sensible identifiable places are convenient pegs on which to hang personal memories, feelings, and values.

Place identity is closely linked to personal identity. I am here, support, I am. Okay.

Another aspect of this church, it provides elements of structure and it gives sense of structure. It means sense of orientation. So we know where we are, which implies how other places are connected to this particular place.

Okay. And the significance of orientation is clear enough. Poor orientation means lost time, wasted effort, especially for strangers.

And it is crucial for handicapped, blind, crippled, retarded, and the deaf. Okay. Okay.

I want to say this. This is a very historic building and it can be, okay. It can, it's properly marketed.

It can be a very important tourist destination. And also it can become a catalyst for the neighborhood, catalyst for developing small businesses like coffee bars, restaurants, gift shops.

[Speaker 1] (28:56 - 28:59)
Thank you, Margaret. Our next speaker, Edward Kuski.

[Speaker 30] (29:06 - 29:14)
Edward Kuski. Edward Kuski, please press star six on your phone to unmute. There you go.

[Speaker 13] (29:15 - 32:20)
Yeah. Good morning, Alderman and staff. Thank you for your services to make City of Chicago a better place.

My name is Edward Kuski. I'm chairman, not chairman, president of the Casswood Terrace Association. I'd like to talk on the upzoning in the 46th Ward at 854 Casswood Terrace.

First, I'd like to cover some history of Casswood Terrace and its background to the issue at hand. The first home built on Casswood Terrace was in 1896. And by 1928, all 28 historic homes were in place on Casswood.

In Casswood subdivision, while property has a covenant on the deed that restricts all dwellings to a single family. Unfortunately, over the years, three of the historic buildings were lost. The remaining 25 were listed on National Register of Historic Places in 2009.

These homes have always been zoned R1. Over the last 28 years, we've had to fight to protect our covenant and R1 zoning to retain the character of the street. Our covenant was upheld in six legal cases, including appellate and Supreme Court.

Our best protection has been both the covenant and the zoning of R1. We want that to continue. Upzoning to RT4, even for a short period, weakens our protection.

Until now, all we have are historical homes that never needed any upzones. Unfortunately, 854 has been vacant and a mess since 1992, and we'd like to see it restored. The only reason we consider upzoning was the owner promised a strong binding agreement.

Since February, the owner and the lawyer have never tried to negotiate the binding agreement. In fact, March 15th, they went dark and did not return any calls or respond to any emails. 41 Casswood Terrace neighbors submitted objection letters with objection letters of upzoning without a binding agreement.

I had offered them before in early May, an agreement, simple agreement by email, but they never responded to that. We do not understand this behavior. Some are concerned that he may want to stay RT4 as long as he can.

Is there something he wants to do that is prohibited by R01? That raises a concern for the community. Never heard about this planned upzoning at a time by family or the ward.

[Speaker 1] (32:20 - 32:33)
Thank you, Ed, and personal greetings from the 44th ward. Appreciate your interest in this particular application. All right, our next speaker is Miguel Chacon.

[Speaker 30] (32:37 - 32:41)
Miguel Chacon, please press star six on your phone.

[Speaker 36] (32:49 - 32:49)
Miguel Chacon.

[Speaker 30] (32:54 - 32:56)
You were unmuted just now. There you go.

[Speaker 20] (32:57 - 35:41)
Okay, Miguel. Thank you, sorry. Yes, this is, my name is Miguel Chacon, and I'm speaking today to voice my opposition to Alderman Sigcho Lopez's rezoning of the St. Adelbert site. Unlike most of the speakers before me who have spoken on this matter, I'm an actual current resident who has lived in Tilton for the last 15 years. Longer than the alderman has lived here. And during that time, plenty has changed, but our community has also missed out on plenty of potential development due to aldermanic progress.

And just like former alderman Danny Feliz, our current alderman is choosing to follow the same path and downzone a site because it is not, because it's what the community wants, but rather because it fits the alderman's political agenda. More importantly, he's doing this against the will of the people in his own ward. The residents of Tilton are not asking for this.

We're not supporting this. And the parishioners of St. Paul's have overwhelmingly stated their opposition to this measure. Yet he is siding with a group who are not Chicago voters nor Tilton residents who are advocating for the church to reopen.

While their intentions might be noble, their plan is highly unlikely to come to fruition. We can look at St. Boniface on the North side as a clear example of what not to do. That property sat vacant for 30 years and has become an eyesore in the community with nothing to show for it.

I'm sure aldermen will yell at every opportunity that he's preventing these quote unquote backroom deals and developers don't want public meeting comments. But the fact is that the alderman has not held a single meeting about this rezoning and he's done this in the past. His own zoning board has voted, has not voted on this.

And yet he claims to support a transparent zoning process. But those are flat out lies and he can't dispute that. This rezoning will not landmark the property, will not save the property.

We already have those mechanisms in place. This is nothing more than political grandstanding. And he wants to be nothing more than be considered Tilton's saviors, but I'm not exactly sure what he's saving us from.

We need more development. We need more neighbors in our community. And Tilton's neighborhood, the population has dropped.

Our schools are grossly under enrolled. Our community lacks the basic resources it needs to thrive. Yet he's more concerned about saving us from potential development than bringing the resources that we just so desperately need.

I encourage everyone to look past his high-pitched shouting match and PR tactics of being for the people, as he says, when in fact he's going against the will of his own constituents and leading with lies and innuendos. I know the aldermen in this committee generally side with the aldermen of each ward on the issues of zoning, but I encourage all the members to consider what is best for the city and the residents in each ward and the tax dollars and the people that live in these neighborhoods instead of the stubbornness of just one politician. I encourage you guys to vote to not rezone the property.

It will not do anything to save the property as it is. There's still other things that can be done, but this is not the right way to go with this. And so I appreciate my time and I appreciate it.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (35:42 - 35:44)
Thank you. Our next speaker, Elizabeth Roman.

[Speaker 38] (35:48 - 35:50)
Can you hear me? Hello?

[Speaker 30] (35:53 - 35:54)
Yes, we can hear you.

[Speaker 14] (35:54 - 35:55)
Hello, can you hear me? Can you hear me?

[Speaker 30] (35:56 - 35:57)
Yes.

[Speaker 14] (35:57 - 38:53)
Hello? Okay, thank you. Thank you.

Good morning. And thank you for the opportunity to share with you today. My name is Elizabeth Roman.

For the past eight years, I have served as the president of the National Catholic Council for Hispanic Ministry known as NCCHN. Established in 1991, our mission is to serve and promote Hispanic ministry through education, advocacy, networking, and leadership. Three years ago, NCCHN relocated its national headquarters to Pilsen Neighbors Community Council in a partnership that has brought a national ministry organization to serve in the community.

For the past decade, NCCHN has had an alliance with Pilsen Neighbors. Eight years ago, we began planning and celebrating the people's mass at Fiesta del Sol. With the people's mass, we added an element of faith and prayer to the festival.

I speak before you today, not just as a Catholic leader, but as someone who is vested in serving in the Pilsen community. I am concerned like so many with what is happening to our people hit so hard in a pandemic and living amid the horrific violence that continues to devastate our communities. We also live with the added burden and fears of being displaced from communities where we have lived as we have heard for generations because new housing developments in our own communities remain out of reach for most of us.

It is heartbreaking to know that the Archdiocese of Chicago has closed over 120 parishes in just four years, among them, St. Adelbert's. St. Adelbert's, as we've heard, is an iconic structure known as much for its stunning architecture as it is for the controversial closing and the church towers, which for years have been wrapped in scaffolding due to their continual deterioration, standing tall as a citywide symbol of the decaying state of the Catholic church in this city. In 2019, NCCHM and Pilsen Neighbors presented a proposal to Cardinal Stupich for St. Adelbert's. For nearly three years, we have been meeting and discerning with the Cardinal's liaison for Renew My Church to invest and transform the St. Adelbert's campus into a thriving community center of encounter, culture and arts, education and formation. So we believe the only way to preserve and maintain St. Adelbert's in the service of the community and for the future is for it to be down zoned. We consider that this zoning best reflects a public use, which not only honors the faith that built it, but also benefits the community, provides services and continues the connections to the diverse communities that have ties to the former St. Adelbert's Parish. Thank you for your time and consideration. God bless you for considering this zoning initiative in favor of the people. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (38:53 - 39:00)
Thank you. Our next speaker, Elvira Bernal.

[Speaker 30] (39:01 - 39:04)
Chairman, Elvira Bernal is not here.

[Speaker 1] (39:05 - 39:09)
All right. Our next speaker is Donna Graves.

[Speaker 15] (39:10 - 39:11)
Can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (39:11 - 39:12)
We can.

[Speaker 15] (39:13 - 42:11)
Good morning. My name is Donna Galuzzo Graves. I was born and raised in Pilsen and my husband and I are raising our five children here today.

I began attending St. Paul Church on Point and 22nd Place over 30 years ago, and I'm proud to say I am the current director of Parish Vitality and Mission. I am here today representing the families of St. Paul who have recently signed a 520 family petition asking you to not down zone the campus of St. Adelbert. We have been told that this process will ensure a community process if there are any future zoning changes requested.

This is confusing to us because there is currently a zoning advisory board for the 25th Ward with representation that advises Aldermen Cincholopas. The community is currently involved. Furthermore, we, the members of the ward, are currently bearing the financial burden to maintain the campus.

As you know, many parishes in Chicago have merged and St. Paul has welcomed families from the latest closures of St. Anne and St. Adelbert. This merger means that St. Paul has been responsible for the buildings and the upkeep of all of these properties as well as our own historical site. Today's 10 person finance council is made up of parishioners of each church and people of the 25th Ward.

We oppose this. Families from all over the city and suburbs who have close connection to Adelberts, many have spoken today, have taken this fight all the way to the Vatican. But after years of attempts, the appeals were denied.

I can understand their passion. I am saddened by their pain and I respect their commitment to history, but this church will not be reopened. What's more, we have just been informed that the 102 residents living within 250 feet of the property who were asked to sign a petition in support of down zoning were given false information.

As a Latina and a member of the community, I am offended that people outside my ward come into my neighborhood with a translator and lie. They were told there was a plan to tear down the church to put up condominiums and this is false. The 520 families representing St. Anne, St. Adelbert and St. Paul are asking you not to do this. We have had two deaths at St. Adelbert, one by suicide and countless individuals breaking into the buildings. Two months ago, our security team found a dead man who had broken into the property and passed away. Each time there is an incident at the campus, we have to pay to resecure the site.

The building continues to fall apart. It is my hope that we can work together in the future to do what's right for the community, but this process of down zoning will not change the fact that the community will be involved and we are asking you not to do it.

[Speaker 1] (42:17 - 42:45)
I believe that ends the public comment period. And in the interest of time and the interest of St. Adelbert, committee members, we are going to move to this aldermanic application by Alderman Siccio-Lopez. It's located on page one of the revised agenda at the bottom of page one.

Alderman Raymond Lopez.

[Speaker 23] (42:46 - 42:49)
Chairman, good morning. Can I be recognized for quorum, please?

[Speaker 1] (42:50 - 44:18)
Yes, sir. And did you hear we're moving? We're gonna be on page one.

We're moving to the aldermanic St. Adelbert application, A8487, 25th Ward. Ordinance was referred on July 24th of 2019. The common address is 1628 through 1650 West 17th Street, also 1629 through 1651 West 16th Street.

The change request from an RT4 residential two-plat townhouse and multi-unit district to a POS-4 parks and open space district. And I believe, I know that Alderman Siccio-Lopez is the sponsor of this. We'll hear from him.

We have talked with the alderman and he will present his, not his witness, a witness in support of his application. And then with all due respect, we have a member of the Archdiocesan of Chicago to speak in opposition. So we'll have one pro and one con on this.

And we'll start with the alderman, of course. Alderman Siccio-Lopez.

[Speaker 3] (44:20 - 50:43)
Thank you, Chairman, and good morning. Thank you to all the committee members for listening to this important issue in our community. As you have heard from the public comment, many of the parishioners and residents, and we have to be factual, I'm also concerned about some of the misinformation that was spread out in terms of the issue at hand.

This is not a new issue. As you know, many of you, this was an issue that we have dealt in our community for almost seven years. In good faith and in commitment to our community, when we took office, we review and rejected a previous plan because it did not have any community input and would have made St. Adalbert yet another project where we would have had luxury units. Fast forward, we had a conversation back then, this is in 2019, 2020, with our two dioceses, with the mayor's office, to make sure that we guarantee a fair process, that we have an open discussion and respect the parishioners, the residents of the ward, especially now in the middle of a pandemic, when we see the huge need in terms of housing, in terms of social services. I think it's only fair that we take into consideration the voices of the community, the voices of the residents who overwhelmingly support an open process. The promises of discussing this matter after things are decided are disingenuous.

And history has told us that after this fact, things are very difficult to change. Furthermore, what we have not discussed here is that in this parish, in a two acre parish, we also still have an active school, a set of schools in our school where a set of CASA's parents have also concerns about any kind of deal that does not include their voices as well. As you know, we have parents who make their schedules around schooling for the children and have not only one, but sometimes two children in the school.

We need to be respectful of our constituents, of our parents, of the community at large. That's what in 2020, we agreed with the Archdiocese and the Mayor's office to have an open process and discuss any proposal coming in front of us with the parishioners and residents as we should. Unfortunately, and again, after multiple attempts, we have not been able to even get a meeting from the Archdiocese.

I sent a letter on February 15th of this year, the latest one. Again, this is an issue coming from 2020 to 2019, where we have already discussed that the Archdiocese indeed has put St. Albert for sale and we wanna discuss the best process moving forward. Unfortunately, what we have seen and what you have heard from parishioners and residents in the ward who don't have any interest other than making sure that the community has a voice are saying that we need an open process.

As you know, I don't take any money from developers. I don't have any other stake, but as someone who grew up Catholic, I do think that our parishioners and our residents deserve an open process that deserve a conversation and a decision that should be in the best interest of the neighborhood, not individual parishes, not the Archdiocese and no one else, but the community and the parishioners at large. We ask you is simply to give us an opportunity to have an open process, to make sure that any proposal we're coming from or zoning advisory board who has recommended that we take this conversation to the public, they are not recommending that we have any behind scenes conversation.

They are supporting these down zones. We also have the vast overwhelming support of residents within the ward, even the National Catholic Council for Hispanic Ministry. We have a large community made of Polish parishioners, Mexican parishioners who are asking to have a voice in all of this.

I urge our colleagues to make sure that we give them a voice and that we're committed to have a fair process. What we cannot do is to sell a parish in the middle of a pandemic to the highest bidder and to neglect or decide later the fate of a school that is still open, the fate of our community that is struggling with displacement. What has not been said that displacement has affected over 14,000 Mexican residents.

With this pandemic has been so rough in our community. We asking the Archdiocese, we asking the St. Paul's Finance Committee who has a stake in this real estate transaction to make sure that we talk about the urgent needs of the parish, but we will do it collaboratively with the Archdiocese, with the parishioners, with the residents and with our office. We together can overcome the challenges ahead, but we gotta be factual.

The fact is that the vast majority of residents in the ward and I put my word on it because I have walked the streets, I have talked directly with residents and I know they wanna be respected and have a voice in this process. The vast majority and I think to my colleagues, please check your email when you have the facts. You have at least 50 emails that have come directly from residents within 250 feet.

You have a petition with addresses that are signed and petitions also again from with 250 feet. We verified with the majority of residents and parishioners are. We asking the Archdiocese please respond to the call of Mexican and Polish parishioners.

We have sent you multiple letters. The latest on February 15th. We deserve a meeting.

It is unconscionable that our community gets treated like that and that we're not even able to get a meeting. So we discussed this. So this is our attempt and our effort to bring everyone to the table and guarantee that parishioners or residents have a voice in this matter.

And the decision is always done in the best interest of the community. The decisions of the past where things are done behind scenes, where realtors and developers have the first set. So are over in our community.

We're asking you just for the committee to give us an opportunity for an open process. This is what the zoning changes that. And we hope that we look forward to working collaboratively with Archdiocese, Tampa and our community to make this a positive in our community and I hope and ask for your favorable vote on this item.

[Speaker 1] (50:44 - 50:59)
Thank you, Alderman. In terms of the witness in support of your down zoning, we have, who is gonna speak on that behalf? Or did they speak in the public comment period, Alderman?

[Speaker 3] (51:06 - 51:11)
Well, I have Elisabeth on the line, Elisabeth Roman. I don't know if she can hear us.

[Speaker 1] (51:11 - 51:27)
She was in the public comment period, I believe. Alderman, we did hear from Elisabeth Roman in the public comment period.

[Speaker 38] (51:30 - 51:30)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (51:31 - 51:41)
All right. Now we're gonna hear in opposition is Eric Wolin from the Archdiocesan of Chicago. Eric.

[Speaker 36] (51:55 - 52:00)
Mr. Chairman, while we're waiting, this is Alderman Dowell to be counted towards quorum.

[Speaker 1] (52:00 - 52:05)
Thank you, Alderman Dowell. Do we have Eric Wolin?

[Speaker 2] (52:06 - 52:11)
And Alderman, Mr. Chairman, can you hear me now? We can. I'm sorry.

[Speaker 1] (52:11 - 52:14)
Identify yourself for the record, please.

[Speaker 2] (52:14 - 52:33)
I'm Eric Wolin. I'm the Chief Capital Assets Officer of the Archdiocese of Chicago. And I do appreciate the chance to quickly present to you and talk a little bit.

We've heard from a number of different constituents here. I'd like to clear up a couple of things and answer any questions to the extent that's necessary.

[Speaker 23] (52:34 - 52:41)
First and foremost- Chairman, excuse me, Chairman, point of information. Can we have the guest turn on his camera so we can see who's speaking?

[Speaker 1] (52:42 - 52:44)
All right. Eric, is that possible?

[Speaker 2] (52:45 - 52:48)
Sorry, I thought it was on. I thought I had to be promoted.

[Speaker 13] (52:49 - 52:49)
One second.

[Speaker 30] (52:49 - 52:55)
We're gonna promote you. Yeah, he just accepted the promotion, so he's coming in. All right.

[Speaker 36] (52:59 - 53:00)
Are we there yet?

[Speaker 2] (53:04 - 59:09)
Nope. They upgraded me to be a panelist. So can you see me now?

All right, there you go. There you go. So thanks so much.

So a couple of things, first and foremost. I know a number of things have been said. There are a number of folks that are passionate about this project and this property.

And we understand that and we share that passion. First and foremost, I wanna be clear. This is about St. Paul and the parish. This is not about the archdiocese. Contrary to what you may have heard, these parish properties, these parish assets are the assets of the local parishes, right? And they're an important source of funding for local mission.

The inability to reuse these properties in some way has a dramatic impact, both as we heard from Donna, the operating costs of carrying them are significant, and the foregone cost of being able to possibly do something with them. It's a significant component of funding local mission, funding the parish, funding its mission, and those funds go back into the community, right? So in this case, St. Paul has spent over a million dollars maintaining those properties over the last six or seven years as this has unfolded. That's money that could have gone into the community sale proceeds, right? And could potentially are a big source of funding mission. So this isn't about the archdiocese.

This isn't about taking assets and selling them or anything to that extent. These are the genesis of this is at the parish level. We also support an open process.

We've had over the last three plus years, we've had meetings with the alderman. We presented a proposal two or three years ago that had a 40, a developer had come in, had a proposal that had over 40% affordable housing at the time when it wasn't required. That wasn't acceptable to the alderman.

He has indicated over and over again, the only thing he can do here is support 100% affordable housing. But, and as a matter of fact, we had a meeting with the city and others where we had a developer put a proposal together for 100% affordable housing and show that that just wasn't financially feasible. That was over two years ago.

They're just, we'd love to work collaboratively. We try to put proposals forward and we haven't made any progress. The parish, and again, this isn't about the archdiocese, right?

So the parish has reached out to the alderman. I know in letters, you know, going back to November, other letters in February, you know, that's where the dialogue should take place. That's with the local folks.

Those letters haven't been responded to, right? That dialogue hasn't been able to happen. That's an important dialogue to occur.

There is a process in place. The idea that there wouldn't be community involvement in the redevelopment, ultimate redevelopment of the Dalbert is simply false. That discussion has to occur no matter what.

And this zoning action does nothing to make that any more likely or change that dynamic. In fact, we've heard about folks that want to preserve the buildings. The idea of zoning a site as public open space where the buildings are totally non-conforming and there can be no reuse of them runs totally contrary to that.

It doesn't make any sense. And, you know, candidly, we view it as a taking by the city as you would expect we might. There's nothing that then can be done with those properties.

Those properties require significant investment. We heard from members of the Santa Dalbert Preservation Community and others, the Hispanic Mission and others. All of those groups we've been engaged in discussions with for over three years.

They have had an unfettered right to put a proposal together for us to discuss the reuse of Santa Dalbert. And they failed to do, put together anything that is practical, feasible, or meaningful. That's, again, we appreciate their sentiments, but they've had years of opportunity and have been unsuccessful in doing that.

The towers at Santa Dalbert require, just to stabilize them, require over $5 million of investment at this point in time. To redevelop the property and make it habitable or usable or functional with the convent building and the rectory and the church would probably be over a $20 million investment. There just isn't the resources, unfortunately, in those groups or others to invest in those buildings.

And so we're looking for a way to meet the needs of the parish, to meet the needs of the community. We've been very transparent that something needs to happen with those buildings because they continue to deteriorate. As we've heard, they are very costly to the parish and they are, and the inability to move forward on something, again, just dramatically negatively impacts the faith community locally there.

As Donna mentioned, in a single day, so we were alerted to this rezoning effort last Thursday. In a single day, the parish was able to gather 500 signatures in opposition of this zoning action. So the idea that the community is overwhelming and in favor of it is simply false.

And I imagine if the parish went out and had a week to gather signatures, there would be many, many hundreds more, if not more than that. So again, I appreciate the sentiments. We absolutely wanna work with the community and the parish wants to work with the community to find a collaborative solution here.

We've been doing that for years with no resolution. And again, we think this zoning action actually moves that process backwards, not forwards. It offers no protections and actually just limits what it damages the site and damages the parish.

So thank you all, I'll be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (59:09 - 59:41)
Eric, we're gonna have an opinion at my request from the law department about the ordinance, and then we will open it up for questions and answers. And of course, we'll hear from Citro Lopez who has his hand up, but I'm gonna see if there's other members of the committee that would like to ask questions on this application. So we have Lisa Misher on the call from the law department, Lisa.

[Speaker 4] (59:41 - 1:02:50)
Well, good morning chair and good morning all in the committee and all in attendance. Yeah, so the city law department, the city of Chicago is not infrequently sued for down zonings. And what we would have to demonstrate is that the down zoning meets the rational basis standard that it's not arbitrary and capricious.

And courts look at a number of factors in deciding whether a rezoning, whether it's down zoning or up zoning is constitutional. And one of the most important factors is how this new zoning category fits in the context of other zoned properties in the area. So for example, if a property is zoned RT4 and it's down zoned to RT3, or some other residential category, there might be a close question about whether that rezoning would be upheld by a court.

Moving within a residential business and commercial and industrial categories up or down by a number can often be justified. This down zoning from RT4 to a POS, Parks and Open Space is highly unusual. Parks and Open Space essentially eliminates all development rights and converts the property to effectively open space, almost a public use.

The church property, although a church like a community center has characteristics of community property and that all are invited, it's private property. It does not belong to the public. It will be viewed as private property in court and a court would look at whether this change in zoning from RT4 to a POS is a legitimate down zoning.

Based on our experience, I don't think it would withstand that test. A POS, it just eliminates all development rights. If a community wants to convert property to a public use in our system of property rights, the way to do that is to buy it, not to down zone it to a point where it can't be used and to use that down zoning as leverage for demanding a different type of use.

So I'd have to say that I have a very negative outlook on how this would prevail and how this would be decided in court.

[Speaker 1] (1:02:52 - 1:03:08)
All right, Lisa, thank you for your opinion and law department opinion. I'm sure you'll be on the call if people have questions from the law department. All right, and we're a couple other hands up on this item.

We'll start with Alderman Capelman.

[Speaker 39] (1:03:09 - 1:03:13)
Excuse me, Chairman, I was raising my hand before.

[Speaker 1] (1:03:15 - 1:04:12)
Look it, you will be closer on this, okay? There might be questions for you, the law department or for the archdiocese. This is how I'm, no, no, no.

This is how I'm running the meeting, okay? You will get your final say. You'll also be available for questions, but we need to hear, we've heard from you on your opening statement and we're gonna hear, I'm going to let the other committee members ask some questions, both to you, the law department and the Catholic church.

So that being said, I'm gonna call on, I will call on you, but I'm going to call on Alderman Capelman first by Alderman Raymond Lopez next and Alderman Cardona third. And then I'll ask you to respond because you might have questions asked of your application. So let's start with Alderman Capelman.

[Speaker 21] (1:04:12 - 1:05:42)
Thank you, Chairman Tunney. I heard the testimony of so many people living in that area and their passion for that community. And I fully get it.

Many of you know, it's no secret, I'm a former Franciscan friar and that's actually what brought me here to Chicago. I have a brother who is a Dominican priest on the West coast and we talk all the time about what the Catholic church is going through. It's a very tough times now with a drop in attendance and actually a drop in people becoming Catholic priests.

So I fully get that. My concern is as an alderman, I took an oath of office that I would uphold the US constitution. And this really smacks of going against the fifth amendment where it's a taking.

Now we can sometimes do that if we offer them something back in return. So my question is, if we're going to down zone this property, which devalues it, which goes against the US constitution, the fifth amendment, what are we doing to incentivize it? What are we giving back so that it does not look as if we are taking?

[Speaker 1] (1:05:46 - 1:06:01)
So the question is the taking issue that Lisa Misher had talked about. I'm going to ask if Alderman Sicho Lopez would like to respond to the question by Alderman Kaplan. And let's respond to the question.

[Speaker 3] (1:06:06 - 1:07:21)
It will be very clear. And I tell you that there's no secret that we have differences in some of the recommendations that oftentimes come from the law department. Last time we had these recommendation by the law department, they told us that we could not settle the case of 18th and Peoria.

And because of our insistence, and by the way, that was another property that the Midwest Jesuit sold it to a developer only to find ourselves later in a legal battle that was costly to the city. In fact, cost us $12 million. The irresponsibility to look at these matters factually because of the relationship that the mayor has with Archdiocese is unconscionable.

I tell you that it is clear because we got the recommendation of the zoning change, by the zoning administrator. This is the first time that the law department expresses any concern. But I tell you that this zoning change is legal and it will stand because there has not been any proposal in front of us.

There has not been. There's multiple communications with Archdiocese where we have asked multiple locations to disclose any proposal and to have an open meeting. They have not responded a single time.

Mr. Walling, tell our office how many times we have in touch with the office. How many times you have responded in writing? All right, all right.

[Speaker 1] (1:07:22 - 1:07:30)
All right, you've made your point. No, no, no, you've made your point. We're still gonna hear from you at the close, but I wanna move on to Alderman Raymond Roberts.

[Speaker 21] (1:07:30 - 1:07:49)
Chair, I just want to add- I'm sorry, Alderman Kappelman. My question was not answered. If we're going to take something away and that's downzoning, what are we giving back that the Archdiocese feels comfortable with?

I'm not gonna speak for Alderman.

[Speaker 3] (1:07:49 - 1:07:58)
All right. Again, we're happy to talk this conversation with Archdiocese, but it takes two to have a conversation. If the other side doesn't wanna talk.

[Speaker 1] (1:07:59 - 1:08:26)
All right, so Alderman Lopez, you've got to hear the debate among the committee members. I know you have strong feelings. We've heard both sides have strong opinions on it.

So what I assess, Alderman Lopez says that he believes that this is passing the test of time and will be constitutional. All right, Alderman Raymond Lopez.

[Speaker 23] (1:08:30 - 1:08:45)
Thank you, Chairman. The original Alderman Lopez on deck now. And I am parked, so if anyone sees me in my car, don't worry.

I do have a question for the Archdiocese. Is there a buyer in mind for this property?

[Speaker 2] (1:08:47 - 1:08:54)
We do. So we do. Sorry, we are in discussions with a potential buyer.

[Speaker 1] (1:08:55 - 1:09:04)
Eric, just for the record, responding to Alderman Raymond Lopez, identify yourself for the record and your role with this Archdiocese.

[Speaker 2] (1:09:04 - 1:09:59)
Sorry, Chairman. So Eric Wolin, Chief Capital Assets Officer of the Archdiocese. So we have had overtime discussions with potential buyers of the property.

And in conjunction with those historically, we have had discussions with the aldermen on and off as that interest has occurred. We are in discussions with another potential buyer right now. We don't have anything signed.

The expectation, of course, is that any potential proposal, we're not a redeveloper, right? We're not in the business of redeveloping properties. So ultimately, we would identify a buyer and they all fully know that there is a public process that they would have to go through to vet any sort of plans.

[Speaker 1] (1:09:59 - 1:10:08)
Okay, Eric, you wanna complete the thought? We're gonna complete the thought, answer the question, and then we'll ask Raymond Lopez if he has a follow-up question.

[Speaker 2] (1:10:08 - 1:10:18)
Absolutely. So there is a buyer we're in discussions with now, but nothing has been finalized at this point. And what is the...

Raymond, excuse me.

[Speaker 23] (1:10:18 - 1:10:23)
Chairman, what is the scope of the project and what's the price?

[Speaker 2] (1:10:24 - 1:10:40)
So I can't disclose that. It isn't finalized. What I would tell you is their plan would be to reuse the buildings.

What's the scope of the price of sale? I can't disclose it because it isn't final. Sure you can.

Actually, you can. And Chairman, I would...

[Speaker 1] (1:10:40 - 1:10:56)
Well, wait, wait, wait. Raymond, Raymond, if he says... Raymond, if he says...

Let me just say this. For the record, he is not responding to your question about the price and just leave it at that. So carry on after that.

[Speaker 23] (1:10:57 - 1:11:56)
I won't leave it at that, Chairman, because this committee three years ago knew the selling price of church property when the archdiocese sold the parking lot at Chicago and State. We were well within our scope then to ask what the price was and what was going on. So this is not outside of past precedent because I was here in that chamber when we had this discussions with the archdiocese last time.

So I'm confused from a historical sense as to why I can't get an answer, even in vague generalities, what we're talking and how much this is going to raise for the archdiocese. Because my understanding is that no parish owns property unto themselves. They are all owned by the archdiocese.

So for the archdiocese not to be able to tell us what the price is when past precedent, as we've been told that, seems to tell me there's something else that we're not... That's something underhanded, for lack of a better expression.

[Speaker 1] (1:11:56 - 1:12:30)
So I would like an answer because I'm old one. So let me reacquaint you with the Holy Name parking lot site. When a private application came before this committee about a redevelopment plan was when...

When we had a redevelopment plan, that was when the question about the value of the underlying real estate. It was not in... It's a different case than what we're experiencing right now.

We had much more of a development plan to entertain and to possibly approve or not approve.

[Speaker 23] (1:12:30 - 1:13:11)
Well, thank you chairman for that because that's exactly my point. I think that's my colleague's point for why they want to downzone because there's not enough information being shared at the moment with the current zoning, which would beg the question, which a tool that we've all used, every single one of us to downzone properties to ensure the community has access. So I think while the archdiocese and the would-be developers are not obligated now to tell us anything, the downzone would make that a requirement.

And I think that is why we only support this because clearly there are answers to be had that are not being gotten. And the only way to force the issue is to downzone this property. And I support that.

Thank you, chairman. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:13:11 - 1:13:13)
Alderman Cardona, please.

[Speaker 31] (1:13:14 - 1:13:27)
Thank you, chairman. This is a question to the archdiocese. Eric, if this process goes downzone, will the archdiocese sue the city of Chicago?

[Speaker 2] (1:13:30 - 1:13:38)
In most likelihood, yes, to preserve our property rights for the reason... Sorry, do I need to identify myself every time I answer, chairman?

[Speaker 1] (1:13:39 - 1:13:44)
No, I think the first time was there under this type of test question and answer period.

[Speaker 2] (1:13:45 - 1:13:48)
So I think the simple answer is yes.

[Speaker 1] (1:13:49 - 1:13:50)
Alderman Cardona.

[Speaker 31] (1:13:51 - 1:14:07)
This is for the law department. If this matter does go about in court, what is the possibility that the city might lose or the city might win on this action?

[Speaker 4] (1:14:10 - 1:16:41)
I think there's a significant chance that the city will lose. The court would look at... I mean, there's the two primary claims would be the takings claim and a substantive due process claim, which looks again at whether there was a rational basis to the downzoning.

And there are a number of factors the court looks at. The takings claim is probably the easiest one to articulate, which is you would evaluate the value of the property under its current zoning, and then the value of the property with POS zoning. And if there is a substantial diminution in value, there is very likely a takings claim.

So, you know, courts, I will say courts are very deferential to the city under the substantive due process claim. But even here, because this is such a significant jump from RT4 to POS, it would be difficult there to articulate a rational basis for that move. Especially we have testimony here that the purpose of this downzoning is to leverage an agreement with the church and the community.

That, so there has not been articulated here any other basis for the downzoning that I've heard other than the church and the community have not, the church and the alderman have not reached a compromise on how the property will be developed. And so the purpose of the downzoning is to get the church to the table to make that, to reach that compromise. And that's not, that doesn't fall into any recognized purpose of downzoning.

Downzoning, any downzoning or upzoning is supposed to be based on land use purposes only.

[Speaker 1] (1:16:42 - 1:16:45)
All right, Alderman Cardona, is there another question?

[Speaker 31] (1:16:46 - 1:17:03)
I just got another question for the IHT's. Communication between you and the Alderman's office, do you have a timeline when it started and until current today? Yeah, we're hearing two different stories.

[Speaker 2] (1:17:03 - 1:18:02)
One from the Alderman and one from the Archdiocese. Sure, so we've had meetings regarding St. Adalbert going back probably three years. I don't have the exact dates.

You know, we've had multiple meetings. We haven't had any meetings recently because frankly, you know, until recently there was no activity on the property. However, the parish, you know, did reach out to the Alderman starting late, you know, last year, we tried to push the discussion away from the Archdiocese.

I mean, again, I need to reemphasize, this is a parish, this is, these are parish decisions. These are parish assets, whether or not technically or legally they're owned by the Archdiocese, they're treated as parish assets. And they've been reaching out to the Alderman over the last six months to try to encourage that discussion.

But our discussions involving the city, you know, Department of Housing and others to talk about potential reuses here have occurred over the last three years with the Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (1:18:04 - 1:18:33)
Alderman Cardona, anything else? That'd be it. Okay, all right.

I did say, I do see two more. I still see more hands up. That would be Alderman Osterman, Haddon, and Waguespack.

But I did say that I would hear from Alderman Siccio Lopez, because those, you want to wait, Alderman Siccio Lopez, because we have a fair amount of hands still up. What would you like to do?

[Speaker 7] (1:18:34 - 1:19:25)
Well, I would like to hear from our colleagues, but what I would like to also point out, again, it seems like this conversation is very driven towards the profit of the sale of a parish, you know? And I think that, you know, the whole conversation around also the legal opinion or something that, as you see, has zero details. I'm just really concerned about just hearing from the legal department now in a purely speculation, nothing concrete.

And last time we had to go through this was, again, when a situation we had to go, again, with our own legal counsel. I think that this is concerning, right? That we'll hear as all the persons from the legal department, the day off, but all along with the zoning administrator was recommending the zoning change, everything was fine.

I'm just concerned about the last- Point taken.

[Speaker 1] (1:19:25 - 1:19:32)
Point taken. And the relationship here. Right, point taken.

We will hear from you to close. All right, Alderman Osterman.

[Speaker 8] (1:19:34 - 1:21:54)
Yes, can you hear me okay? Yes. So I'll say this, that I'm gonna support Alderman Sitko Lopez in the downzoning today.

I think I am one that I would rather see an amicable solution for an adaptive reuse. Amical means people sitting down together and not yelling at each other on both sides. So I will say that that's the case.

The bigger issue that I'm gonna point out to my colleagues is this. This is not the first, nor will it be the last situation like this that's gonna occur in our city. And I think that it would be wise for the planning department to sit down with the archdiocese first and talk about all of their properties that they have and what their future plans may be, to look at it more holistically instead of it being one at a time.

Because the archdiocese is the largest of the churches in our city that have issues with older buildings and decreased parishioners, but they are not alone. But it would be in our city's interest to look at this holistically and not get into a fight neighborhood by neighborhood. If we look at it holistically, there could be a win-win there for everybody, where these buildings and properties can be used in a positive constructive way and not pitting the church against us, where we may end up in court or we may not end up in court.

Because otherwise we're gonna be spending a lot of time in the zoning committee on all of these churches. And I think once we deal with the Catholics, we go on to the other faiths that are all having similar problems. And I think as a city and a place that needs spaces within communities for young people and old people to gather safely, we should look at this in a positive way instead of in the way that we're in right now.

So I'm with the Alderman today, but I would encourage the law department, the planning department to look at this more proactively and how we move forward. Thank you. Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (1:21:54 - 1:21:56)
Alderman Maria, Alderwoman Maria Hadden.

[Speaker 9] (1:21:58 - 1:25:08)
Thank you, Chair. I also have been listening and I've read a lot of the comments and testimony that was sent to the committee that you forwarded onto us. I'll say I'm also in support of Alderman Citro Lopez's efforts here because I see why he's doing it.

I appreciate Alderman Osterman's comments and 100% support that and would encourage the archdiocese and our department of planning to work together on those future plans. I know we're working with parishioners and the St. Ignatius property and have had some different conversations that I think are going well, but realize that this is a bigger issue. And as much as this might come to private property, and in the archdiocese and the parish kind of moving within what they feel to be their rights, non-profit status, right?

And the tax exempt status that all non-profit institutions, whether they be the archdiocese or our universities, there are responsibilities that these institutions have to the public and the community. And we should be working together to find solutions on what we can do with our spaces. We certainly are in need as the city, as residents.

And I know that if we are looking and questioning the use of what powers and authorities we have as older people, we should be using our powers and authorities in support of our constituents and our parishioners in order to make sure that they're at the table, that they're part of the discussion and that they've got voice in the solution. So that's why I support this effort to make sure that those conversations can continue because it's very difficult. And there's oftentimes an imbalance of power between large institutions and the residents that we serve in not being given the information and the feeling that things are being done behind closed doors and not necessarily having information disclosed even in a public setting when asked.

And these are wholly important sites to so many people in our community and they absolutely care about what happens to them. Adaptive reuse, we've seen so many wholly spaces turned into private homes, residences, condos. And it's hard to set aside the negative feelings that can come to a community when it seems a decision is made simply for profits.

And I know that things are more complex than that but that's why we've got to work together. So support Alderman Sigtjo-Lopez in this effort because I think it'll lead us to a solution. And I hope the archdiocese and all that you do for Chicago and for Chicagoans, I hope that you guys will work with the city and maybe be able to tell us what you need in order to strike that balance as Alderman Osterman spoke to.

So thank you, Chairman Tun.

[Speaker 1] (1:25:09 - 1:25:11)
Thank you, Alderwoman. Alderman Scott Wagesbeck.

[Speaker 6] (1:25:13 - 1:25:44)
Thanks, Chairman. Actually, I had some questions for Mr. Wallen. So Mr. Wallen, when you talked about other potential projects there, you had mentioned that you had, well, you had one project that 40% affordable that wasn't accepted. But what percentage of this property do you see as reusable in your estimation for residential adaptive reuse?

[Speaker 2] (1:25:46 - 1:26:50)
I guess that's a tough question to answer, right? I mean, it is a very large, very expensive, very complicated building. I think we've had, in the past, we've had proposals to us that would redevelop the entire property into residential of some sort, right?

With a component of affordable, a component of market rate, the church building is a huge challenge, right? Incredibly expensive, and people had a lot of difficulty getting their arms around what to do there. The current proposal is one of developing more of a community space, more of a potential event space or something along those lines, maybe, and looking at it that way.

And then some complimentary uses associated with that. I think our expectation had always been that it would be a residential reuse of some sort of adaptive reuse, but the economics can be challenging.

[Speaker 6] (1:26:51 - 1:27:02)
But it's adaptive reuse that you were looking at, not a tear down of, I mean, I guess, you might have to take apart some of it, but we've seen adaptive reuses.

[Speaker 2] (1:27:03 - 1:27:17)
Yeah, every proposal we've ever entertained, I mean, we're sensitive to the community, we're sensitive to the buildings, has been an adaptive reuse of the property. I mean, there is some vacant land there that might have some new development, but the buildings themselves would be reused.

[Speaker 6] (1:27:17 - 1:27:29)
Okay, and then in your position, you essentially handle a lot of these other properties throughout the diocese, even though the individual parishes are the ones kind of making the decision?

[Speaker 2] (1:27:30 - 1:27:40)
That's correct, so we help facilitate, we bring in a level of real estate expertise to help advise the parishes and manage the process.

[Speaker 6] (1:27:40 - 1:27:53)
And then roughly how many other properties have been rezoned in the last few years? I mean, not going back 10 or 20, but maybe decade, because that's when I think you started consolidating over the last decade, right?

[Speaker 2] (1:27:54 - 1:28:15)
Yeah, really, probably over the last five years is when the bulk of the unifications have occurred. And I guess just to clarify your question, Alderman, when you say rezoned, are you referring to, like for instance, properties we've sold that have been subsequently been redeveloped or rezoned while they're still church property?

[Speaker 6] (1:28:17 - 1:28:35)
The prior, the former. So basically ones that you redeveloped with those real estate experts perhaps and got a zoning change with a type one type plan or something like that. And I'm not saying give me the exact number, but just you've been doing them.

[Speaker 2] (1:28:35 - 1:28:43)
Yeah, I would say, frankly, let's say over the last four to five years, that's probably less than a dozen.

[Speaker 6] (1:28:43 - 1:28:44)
Okay.

[Speaker 2] (1:28:44 - 1:28:47)
And probably closer to half dozen, frankly, that I could name.

[Speaker 6] (1:28:47 - 1:28:50)
Okay, and then how many unifications have you done?

[Speaker 2] (1:28:51 - 1:29:13)
Well, the Archdiocese overall in Cook and Lake County, we basically, we're at about 230 parishes now, down from about 330 over the last five years. But what I should clarify, that doesn't mean a hundred sites have closed, right? A unified parish in many cases becomes a multi-site parish.

[Speaker 6] (1:29:13 - 1:30:02)
Okay. I guess I was going to Alderman Osterman's point. You're gonna have a lot of other, but you have your unifications.

You're probably gonna have some other closings based on what's happening. From somewhat of what I read in some of those letters, St. Hedwig, St. John Birchman, where I'm kind of dealing with issues there. And then my last question is what, so I get the rough idea of what you had there, but what's the typical reuse or rezoning classification that you achieved in some of those other developments?

I mean, I know of the one with St. Hedwig, I know exactly what happened there with the affordable piece and the residential reuse or adaptive reuse of the convent. You have done other convents and other non-Catholic churches. So I just wonder roughly.

[Speaker 2] (1:30:03 - 1:30:48)
Yeah, so today that would be a very typical reuse, right? I mean, frankly, most of what we've done in the city today has been a few schools and several convents that are being converted to residential. And those would follow, they would have the required affordable component.

There have been a few that I think have been small enough that maybe haven't hit that requirement. I don't know exactly, but usually they'll go in for some sort of a zoning. Rarely have we done anything, has anyone done anything as of right?

I think we've had one maybe, and the rest have required the public hearings and the rezonings and all those types of things.

[Speaker 6] (1:30:48 - 1:31:09)
Adjustments, right, okay. And then in each one that we did, I think we did go back and forth quite often, but it was part of the community, the church community, the parish and the diocese all at the table, plus those real estate experts. Is that your experience, at least with us or several others?

[Speaker 2] (1:31:10 - 1:32:02)
It is, and again, typically, right, we always try to be respectful of the buildings, of the community and all those things. Ultimately, we're not the developers, right? And so, we try to select the right people to present the right proposal, right?

And that involves discussions either directly with us, with the relative, with the appropriate alderman, with our potential buyer, right? With the alderman and the alderman's office. I mean, all those discussions occur.

I mean, that framework is available. Almost all of our properties in any sort can't be developed as of right. They're just not known that way.

And so, the opportunity for community input for discussion occurs in every case. I don't know of one where that didn't occur.

[Speaker 6] (1:32:03 - 1:33:02)
All right, well, I appreciate the answers to those questions. I see what kind of position you're in, but I also appreciate the letter. Although I don't know, thank you, Mr. Wallen. Chairman, I don't know if Lisa Miescher could answer this question too. She had mentioned that when it comes to lawsuits, it's about the actual zoning change. And if it's, I remember what specifically the word was, it has to have, you can't have a significant jump.

Courts are deferential to the city with the due process issue. What, Lisa, could you answer on Mr. Wallen's second page of the archdiocese letter about the arbitrary decision? This is the second to last paragraph.

I don't know if you have that in front of you.

[Speaker 4] (1:33:03 - 1:33:06)
I'm sorry, I don't have the letter in front of me.

[Speaker 6] (1:33:06 - 1:33:43)
If I could just read it, the real portion real quick. It's, in addition, we view this action, this is from Mr. Wallen, as a violation of the religious land use and institutionalized persons act, religious freedom restoration act of 1993, and then the Illinois constitution as discriminatory against religion and unnecessary burden on religion. So in that sentence there, when we're looking through the law department at, when the court is looking at these types of decisions, do they typically include that on a zoning decision or is that, is it relevant or irrelevant?

[Speaker 4] (1:33:43 - 1:34:11)
Well, it can be relevant when a, especially when the church or other religious institution is operating. I think it's different when a church is no longer functioning as a religious place of worship.

[Speaker 6] (1:34:13 - 1:34:20)
So it- You don't have it in front of you. So I know it's kind of difficult to answer that, but.

[Speaker 4] (1:34:21 - 1:34:53)
We are in a better position because the church is no longer acting as a religious place of worship, but it's not, I don't, I'm not an expert in that law, but I don't think it's completely off the table because, for example, I would just like to say that a court doesn't distinguish in zoning decisions between nonprofit religious institutions and what sort of duty they owe to the community and a private property owner.

[Speaker 6] (1:34:54 - 1:34:56)
Okay. Does not distinguish.

[Speaker 4] (1:34:57 - 1:35:11)
No, a court will look at the zoning decision independent of who the property owner is. If it is a private property owner, the church will be treated the same as any other private property owner.

[Speaker 6] (1:35:11 - 1:35:20)
Okay. All right. Thank you for that.

Appreciate it. All right. Chairman, you might want to send the letter over to her, but that's all I have.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:35:20 - 1:35:30)
Letter's been sent to Lisa Misher. Okay. All right.

Our final question from committee members is Alderman Hopkins.

[Speaker 29] (1:35:31 - 1:35:40)
Yeah. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to make sure I'm correct on this.

This is a change to POS-4, the cemetery classification. Is that correct?

[Speaker 1] (1:35:44 - 1:35:48)
Yes. POS-4 is the request of the Alderman.

[Speaker 29] (1:35:48 - 1:35:56)
Is there any other use within that designation besides cemeteries or is it- Let me ask Patrick.

[Speaker 1] (1:35:57 - 1:36:04)
Brian, if you don't mind, I'll ask Patrick to just elaborate on the POS-4. Thank you.

[Speaker 27] (1:36:04 - 1:36:24)
Sure. Hi, good morning, Chairman and Alderman. Patrick Murphy with Department of Planning.

So it allows for wireless communication facilities and minor utility services, which are available in other zoning districts as well. But from the pantheon of open space uses that are available in a POS district, there is nothing else allowed in a POS-4.

[Speaker 29] (1:36:27 - 1:36:39)
And am I correct in that any of the other POS districts would require public ownership of the land at the time that the zoning designation is imposed?

[Speaker 27] (1:36:40 - 1:36:40)
Correct.

[Speaker 29] (1:36:40 - 1:37:00)
It's designed for publicly owned real estate. Yes, sir. Right.

So this is the only one that could be used on land that is not owned by a public entity. Yes, sir. Is there any portion of it that would currently be in compliance with POS-4 if we pass this?

[Speaker 27] (1:37:03 - 1:37:08)
No, not, strictly speaking, no, from what they are, from what the facility is used for, no.

[Speaker 29] (1:37:11 - 1:37:24)
Okay, well, I'm not going to say anything more because I'm creating a record here, but I'm going to stand with my colleague on this, but there's obviously some pretty serious defects with this. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:37:25 - 1:37:36)
All right. So Alderman Siccio-Lopez, we want to take a vote if there's a recommendation or a motion but do you have the final say, as I said before?

[Speaker 7] (1:37:37 - 1:39:54)
Yeah, no, thank you. Thank you, Chairman, and to our colleagues. I want to reemphasize our commitment.

I think Alderman Osterman said it as well. Our commitment is to have an open process. I think that what we're asking our community is to look at the facts and the facts of the matter is that we have a community that is struggling.

It has a struggle and being victim of corruption, of displacement, you name it, a community that needs help. What we're asking is to have an open process. Last time this was told, this same discourse was used, the developer that supposedly is used is offered 40%, that is not correct.

It was less than that. It was merely a mere 30%, perhaps with the studios. By the way, this developer also was the developer that whitewashed or beloved Casa's plan.

And that is why they had a lot of tremendous opposition. Not only did not offer adequate affordability, but also was a developer that was questionable in our community. That is why it's important to have open conversations and to do it in the open.

We owe it to our parishioners. We owe it to the residents in our community to be part of these conversations. We understand the need of team now more than ever to have, as you see, independent legal counsel.

We believe strongly as we've done with 18th and Peoria that time will be wise and will prevail because we're doing it with transparency and participation of parishioners and residents. Make no mistake. This is a proposal that will blindside our community if it's allowed to go unchecked.

That's what we need to make sure that as elected officials and I think every other person here must have the positive community. This is a community that is asking for help and transparency and this is our intent and our commitment here publicly to do so with the archdiocese, with our parishioners and residents, but do it in the open. We take risks all the time and settlements are taken by the city as legal department said often, but where has the city take a stance for the right thing to take a risk for the community that is seeing unprecedented crisis?

We're asking you to take a decisive vote to make sure that we hear parishioners and we believe also what Alderman Osborne said and said it well. This is an opportunity for us to have a different approach to empty parishes, to give an opportunity to recreate and transform, especially in times of crisis. We need these spaces to thrive.

[Speaker 1] (1:39:54 - 1:39:59)
Again- Alderman Lopez, will you summarize? Yes. So we can get going.

[Speaker 7] (1:39:59 - 1:40:49)
Yes, thank you. So the last thing I'd like to say is to please give us a chance. We see how in other communities, people have had an opportunity to have a seat at the table.

We hear multiple examples. There is precedent. Why the Latino community and the Polish community for that matter is not being treated the same.

That is discriminatory. And we ask the archdiocese to sit at the table, to sit in transparency. We can hear the different plans here.

This is the first time I heard more, many of the things that the archdiocese said. Why we don't say those things in the open and in meetings? We have our commitment to work with us, but what we cannot allow is in this kind of organization that don't pay taxes to try to profit when we have an unprecedented crisis.

Please, to my colleagues, I urge you, start with our community. You have our commitment, and I know that we will pass legal motion. And thank you again, sir.

[Speaker 1] (1:40:49 - 1:40:59)
Thank you. All right, I appreciate it. If no other questions by committee members, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 23] (1:41:00 - 1:41:01)
So moved Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 1] (1:41:04 - 1:41:06)
Any objections to his motion?

[Speaker 21] (1:41:07 - 1:41:09)
Alderman Capelman votes no.

[Speaker 6] (1:41:12 - 1:41:14)
Any others? Chairman, I'd like to be recorded as no.

[Speaker 1] (1:41:15 - 1:41:39)
All right, let me do that. Well, hold on. I'm gonna do a roll call, okay?

So, all right. We're gonna take a roll call on this item, please. I'm gonna start with Vice Chair Roboyas.

No. I'm sorry, is that a no? No.

Okay. Alderman Hopkins.

[Speaker 38] (1:41:40 - 1:41:40)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (1:41:41 - 1:42:11)
Alderman Dowell. Alderman Sawyer. Alderman Beal.

Alderman Raymond Lopez. Aye. Alderman David Moore.

Alderman David Moore, aye. Alderman Rodriguez, Michael. Aye.

Alderman Siccio-Lopez.

[Speaker 38] (1:42:12 - 1:42:13)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (1:42:14 - 1:42:30)
Alderman Burnett. Aye. Alderman Cardona.

Aye. I'm sorry, let me get, Alderman Cardona. Aye.

Alderman Wagesveld.

[Speaker 38] (1:42:30 - 1:42:30)
No.

[Speaker 1] (1:42:32 - 1:42:55)
Alderman Austin. Alderman Villegas. Aye.

Alderman Riley. Alderman Capelman. No.

Alderman Osterman. Aye. Alderwoman Haddon.

Aye. Chair Toney is a no.

[Speaker 36] (1:42:56 - 1:42:57)
Alderman Dowell is an aye.

[Speaker 1] (1:42:58 - 1:44:04)
Alderman Dowell is an aye. 11 ayes, four nays. Anyone else?

All right, so we have 11 ayes and four nays. This will report it out in the affirmative at the council meeting on Wednesday. All right, thank you, everybody.

And we'll, now we will go back to the regular agenda and we'll start off. Who's on page four? You are on, yeah, you're jumping.

All right, okay. We'll start off with the addendum to the agenda. The first item on the addendum is document number 02022-1035.

The amendment of the municipal code section 17-6-0403-G. Excluding food and beverage retail sales use group within plan manufacturing district number 4B from required floor area limits. Alderman Burnett, would you like to speak on this matter?

[Speaker 24] (1:44:08 - 1:44:38)
Yes, Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. If I'm not mistaken, this is the ordinance that allow for folks to get liquor license along the river. We have a large music venue at the site of Morton Salt that's gonna bring a lot of tourists and a lot of money to the city of Chicago.

So I asked for the committee support.

[Speaker 1] (1:44:40 - 1:44:59)
All right, we have a question here just to affirm what we are attempting to pass. Patrick Murphy, would you get on the call on this one just to make sure that we're on the right application that the Alderman has presented?

[Speaker 27] (1:44:59 - 1:45:14)
Right, this is Patrick Murphy with the Department of Planning. Alderman Burnett, this is the ordinance regarding PMD zoning designations, not riverwalk uses and liquor licenses.

[Speaker 24] (1:45:19 - 1:45:28)
Oh, go ahead. Just excuse me, I'm in the car and I listened to you briefly. So this is which one?

This is the PMDs?

[Speaker 27] (1:45:28 - 1:45:29)
Yes, sir.

[Speaker 24] (1:45:31 - 1:45:31)
To do what?

[Speaker 27] (1:45:33 - 1:45:33)
Go ahead.

[Speaker 1] (1:45:34 - 1:45:35)
We're excluding something.

[Speaker 27] (1:45:35 - 1:46:03)
Right, there are... Patrick. Sorry, go ahead.

There are already certain allowances for uncapped food and beverage retail sales in PMDs. This adds another PMD sub area to that. Exactly.

This is not the Morton Salt area, Alderman Burnett. Which area is this, Patrick? No, this is Kinsey.

[Speaker 24] (1:46:04 - 1:46:16)
Oh, this is over in Kinsey. Oh, this is the... So, oh, okay.

And did I introduce this, Pat, or ask you to do this?

[Speaker 27] (1:46:17 - 1:46:20)
Yes, you introduced it, sir. Would you like me to call you, sir?

[Speaker 24] (1:46:21 - 1:46:31)
Yeah, can you- To explain? Sure. Can you put it on hold?

I apologize, Alderman. You know, I have a hundred of these things going on and I can't remember them all. But let me get refreshed on it, okay?

[Speaker 1] (1:46:31 - 1:47:04)
All right, so we'll come back to this with Alderman Burnett in a few minutes. Okay, thanks. Thank you.

All right, so next item is one historical landmark fee waiver document number 0R2022-114 in the 46th ward for the property located at 1039 through 1059 West Lawrence. We have Ms. Rimes, who's on? Michelle Rimes.

[Speaker 28] (1:47:04 - 1:48:39)
Michelle Rimes, would you talk to us about this item? Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, I am Michelle Rimes.

I am a project manager with the Department of Planning and Development and staff to the Commission on Chicago Landmarks. The applicant is seeking a permit fee waiver in the amount of $43,904.70 for the expenditure of $5 million for the repurposing and alterations and renovation of a building that includes facade work, installation of new storefronts on the first floor, the installation of windows on the second floor, construction of a new roof with the addition of a solar panel, interior work including the installation of new mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems and finishes to the elevators, walls, hallways, apartment kitchens and the bike home. The project scope also includes the construction of a landscape courtyard with a dog friendly area.

The property is located at 1039 to 1059 West Lawrence Avenue. It is a architecturally significant building. It was once known as the Viceroy Hotel and it is going to be converted into an 80 unit building.

[Speaker 1] (1:48:43 - 1:48:50)
All right, thank you, Ms. Rimes. Alderman Kappelman on the Lawrence landmark fee waiver, please.

[Speaker 21] (1:48:52 - 1:49:25)
Yes, this is Alderman James Kappelman. This is a building that in the community, it was hit hard by the life safety ordinance. They were required to do a lot of remodeling that was indicated and due to all those high costs and the extreme financial hardship, the owner went to over 20 banks, I think 22 banks to get loans to help get this done.

So I ask my colleagues to support this.

[Speaker 6] (1:49:31 - 1:49:33)
Move to pass chairman if there's no questions.

[Speaker 1] (1:49:38 - 1:50:20)
All right, Alderman Wajcicak makes the motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, this item is passed.

All right. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.

And then we'll go back to Alderman Burnett's document, Aldermanic introduction of 02022-135, the amendment of municipal code section 17-60403-G, excluding food and beverage retail sales use group within plan manufacturing district number 4B from the required floor area limits. All right, Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 36] (1:50:27 - 1:50:33)
Walter, I know you're in the call.

[Speaker 24] (1:50:45 - 1:50:46)
I apologize.

[Speaker 1] (1:50:48 - 1:50:58)
Okay, we got you now. So let's talk about this, Aldermanic. Can you hear me, Alderman?

I'm back. We're back and we need to hear from you.

[Speaker 24] (1:50:59 - 1:51:40)
Yeah, definitely. So Patrick gave me some clarification. I have a sub area in my PMDB area in the Kinsey area.

We're bringing it into conformity as all of the sub areas throughout the city to allow these things to happen. In particular, for me along Ashland Avenue, there's opportunity for an establishment to come, but we're doing it for the whole area to be consistent. I asked for the committee support on this, which is trying to bring it into conformity with all the other PMDs to have sub areas like this.

[Speaker 1] (1:51:40 - 1:51:48)
All right. All right. And you have an active applicant that's wanting to fill the space?

[Speaker 24] (1:51:50 - 1:52:14)
Well, there's a potential applicant, but that's speculation. So we did a sub area along Ashland Avenue where we allow for more commercial spaces to go up and we want to allow for those areas to be able to have these things.

[Speaker 1] (1:52:14 - 1:52:49)
Great, okay. Questions for the Alderman? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move to pass for the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

I get a motion. Alderman Capelman makes the motion. Any objections to his motion?

Hearing none, the item is passed. All right. All right.

I know we will hear from you later, Alderman Burnett, I'm sure. All right. Now we're on page five.

It's five. Okay.

[Speaker 38] (1:52:50 - 1:52:50)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:52:51 - 1:55:12)
Now we're moving on to large signs over 100 square feet in area, 24 feet above grade. We'll hear them all together. I'll read the ward followed by the address and take a motion at the end.

In the first ward, one sign located at 2501 Northwestern Avenue, three signs in the 11th ward located at 2201 South Halsted Street, three signs in the 14th ward located at 5211 South Cicero Avenue, one sign in the 24th ward located at 3420 West Roosevelt Road, two signs in the 25th ward located at 921 South Jefferson Street, one sign in the 32nd ward located at 2785 North Clybourne Avenue, one sign in the 41st ward located at 8700 West Bryn Mawr Road, one sign also in the 41st ward located at 8501 West Higgins Road. And lastly, one sign in the 50th ward located at 3100 West Peterson Avenue. No questions, if no questions by committee members.

Can I get a motion to move do pass for the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Alderman Wagesbeck makes the motion. Any objections to his motion?

Hearing none, these orders are passed. We'll now move on to the regular agenda in an effort to minimize technical difficulties and to ensure the committee meeting runs as smoothly as possible. The typical order in which items will be heard has been updated throughout the duration of virtual committee on zoning meetings.

Items will be grouped together according to witness attorney and will be heard in that order rather than the ward order. All right, page one, I am going to skip over the 44th ward application and then my, and we'll do 44 together with the private application and then I will cede the chair, I think to Alderman Wagesbeck. All right, so middle of page one.

All right, should I read it in the record first? Patrick, would you, we're on document number 8751. You wanna, I hear you wanna chime in on this.

[Speaker 27] (1:55:13 - 1:55:26)
No, well, Patrick Murphy with Department of Planning, just that the posted notice signed requirement was not installed by staff in time to meet the notice requirements for this item and move ahead for this month's hearing.

[Speaker 1] (1:55:29 - 1:55:40)
All right, Alderman Talaferro is on the call. Chris, are you, have you heard the response from our planning department?

[Speaker 34] (1:55:41 - 1:55:45)
No, you know what, I just missed it. I apologize. All right, Patrick.

[Speaker 27] (1:55:45 - 1:55:58)
Sure, I'm sorry, Alderman Talaferro, Patrick Murphy, Department of Planning. The posted notice requirement for this Aldermanic item was not put up in time by staff. So the item, we only found out this morning.

The item cannot go ahead with this month's hearing.

[Speaker 34] (1:55:59 - 1:56:02)
Okay, we can, Chairman, we can hold it in committee. That's fine. All right.

[Speaker 27] (1:56:02 - 1:56:02)
Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 34] (1:56:03 - 1:56:21)
I had a little concern as well. It's an M1-2, it's all school property that's going to go to, or just being, before this committee to be RT4. And I was wondering why we're not making it just M1-2 instead of residential, but I'm glad it's being held.

[Speaker 1] (1:56:22 - 1:56:39)
Thank you, Alderman. Thank you. Now let's go back to 44 for a second.

I understand that the signage was not posted properly or on a timely matter on my item in 44, that being 835 West Addison?

[Speaker 27] (1:56:39 - 1:56:40)
Correct, sir.

[Speaker 1] (1:56:40 - 1:56:51)
Okay, so we will defer based on process, make sure we did. My office was aware that notice was sent, but posting was not.

[Speaker 27] (1:56:51 - 1:56:53)
The sign was not put up on the property, correct, sir?

[Speaker 1] (1:56:54 - 1:57:28)
All right. So I'm going to get them both, well, we'll do them separately. So we'll start in the 29th Ward, document number A8751.

The ordinance was referred on April 27th of 2022, common address 5050 West, a 5050 through 5064 West Harrison Street. The change request is M1-2 limited manufacturing business park district to RT4 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district. I need a motion to defer this item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

[Speaker 6] (1:57:29 - 1:57:30)
So moved chairman, Alderman Wagesbeck.

[Speaker 1] (1:57:30 - 1:58:02)
Alderman Wagesbeck makes the motion. Any objections to the motion? Hearing none, the item is deferred.

Now I'm going to go back to page one, number A8772, 44th Ward. Ordinance was referred on May 2nd of 2022. Common address is 835 West Addison.

Change request, RM5 residential multi-unit district to B13 neighborhood shopping district. And I'll need a motion to defer this item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

[Speaker 6] (1:58:03 - 1:58:05)
So moved chairman, Alderman Wagesbeck.

[Speaker 1] (1:58:05 - 1:59:08)
Alderman Wagesbeck makes the motion. Any objections? Hearing none, this item also will be deferred.

We have dealt with the item in the 25th Ward that would be the Adelbert item. So now we're on page two and we are now in the 50th Ward. Document number 21006, 50th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on April 27th of 2022. Common address is 6524 North Rockwell. And the change request from an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RT3.5 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district. And I believe we have Terrell Henley or Stacey Adam Henley. I think Stacey Ann, right. So would you like to explain this to the committee, please?

[Speaker 33] (1:59:09 - 1:59:39)
The Henley's? Sure, good morning committee members. My name is Terrell Henley.

Myself and my wife are the property owners at 6524 North Rockwell Street in the West Rogers Park neighborhood. We're looking or rather seeking approval to rezone our area from an RS3 to an RT3.5. And the reason why is we have a pretty sizable basement space that we currently use as part of an extension of our family home. And we want to convert it to an apartment to create a legal three flat.

[Speaker 1] (1:59:42 - 2:00:34)
Thank you for your testimony. We do have a letter of support from Alderwoman Silverstein. Questions by committee members?

If not, can I get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Osterman so moves. Alderman Osterman makes the motion.

Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the item is passed. Thank you and good luck to you.

Thank you. Middle of page two, document number 21013-T1 in the 48th Ward. Ordinance was referred in April 27th of 2022.

Common address 1215 through 1219 West Devon Avenue and the change request. B31 Community Shopping District to B33 Community Shopping District. We have Paul Colpac on this item in the 48th Ward.

[Speaker 26] (2:00:36 - 2:00:55)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the board. My name is Paul Colpac. I represent the owner and the applicant, Dr. Mamedi. As you mentioned, we're requesting a zoning change from B31 Community Shopping District to B3-3. Since this is type one, I would ask that the exhibits and the narrative be made prior to this proceeding.

[Speaker 1] (2:00:56 - 2:01:08)
So Alderman Kaplan moves to accept the substantive narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine form. Any objections? Hearing none, the substantive narrative and plans are accepted.

[Speaker 26] (2:01:09 - 2:01:53)
Thank you. The purpose of the zoning change property is a mixed use property with commercial restaurants on the first floor and unused office space on the top floors. The request is to reconfigure the upper level to five dwelling units with four parking spaces.

This does qualify as a transit-oriented development. We have gone through Alderman Osterman's community process. We believe we have community and aldermanic support.

There is a letter in your file from the alderman for the same.

[Speaker 1] (2:01:55 - 2:02:00)
Hi, we do have a letter of support from Alderman Osterman, I believe, and he is on the call.

[Speaker 8] (2:02:01 - 2:02:16)
Harry, do you want to talk about this item? All is correct. They've got my support.

They've gone through the community process, five new units of park residents, and one of them will be an ARO unit. So we're looking forward to it, and I hope that the committee can support this change. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:02:18 - 2:02:24)
Alderman Osterman, so we're going from B3-1 to B3-3. Was that to take advantage of TOD?

[Speaker 8] (2:02:25 - 2:02:59)
It was to take advantage of the site with underutilized property on a commercial street to add some residential. So I think the goal was have it kind of add some density to the Devon area and kind of help spruce it up. There's good commercial on the first floor, but you want to add some residents up top, and one of the units will be affordable.

And parking? Parking is limited. I think there are a couple of parking spaces, but it's close to the Devon and the Granville Redline stations, as well as the Broadway bus.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:02:59 - 2:03:10)
Questions from committee members? Can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum with the substantive narrative and plans as part of it?

[Speaker 6] (2:03:10 - 2:03:12)
Chairman, Alderman Wagesbeck moves to pass.

[Speaker 1] (2:03:12 - 2:03:48)
All right, Alderman Wagesbeck makes the motion. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, this item is passed with the substantive narrative and plans.

Thank you. Bottom of page two, document number 20998, 30th Ward. Ordinance was referred on April 27th of 2022.

Common address, 4211 West Roscoe Street. Change request. From an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district.

Paul Colpeck again.

[Speaker 26] (2:03:49 - 2:04:28)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the board. My name is Paul Colpeck. I represent the applicant, Mr. Rafael Szymanski. As you mentioned, Alderman, we're requesting the zoning change from RS3 residential single unit to that of an RT4 residential two-flat and multi-unit district. The purpose is to allow a construction of a two-story four-dwelling unit residential building with onsite four-car parking garage. We met with Alderman Roboyas.

We went through his community process. We believe we have community support as well as automatic support. There is a letter in your file from Alderman Roboyas.

[Speaker 1] (2:04:31 - 2:04:48)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Roboyas. I believe he still is on the call or no, no, no. He's left the meeting for now, but we do have a letter of support on file for this application.

Questions from committee members.

[Speaker 38] (2:04:50 - 2:04:51)
Move to pass.

[Speaker 1] (2:04:51 - 2:05:01)
Alderman Dowell makes the motion move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to her motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

[Speaker 26] (2:05:01 - 2:05:04)
Thank you very much for your time. Everybody be well, be safe.

[Speaker 1] (2:05:04 - 2:05:30)
Thank you, Paul. Top of page three. Document number 21020 in the 48th ward.

Ordinance was referred on April 27th of 2022. Common address 5300 through 5318 North Kenmore Avenue, change request from an RM5 residential multi-unit district to B11 neighborhood shopping district. And Bridget O'Keefe is the attorney on this.

[Speaker 22] (2:05:37 - 2:05:38)
Bridget, I think you're muted.

[Speaker 35] (2:05:42 - 2:06:00)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My name is Bridget O'Keefe. I'm a partner at Gaspin and Almond, 300 South Wacker Drive, Chicago 60606.

With your approval, Mr. Chairman, I'd like to introduce you to my colleague, Janet Stengel, who's an attorney with our firm who will be handling this matter today.

[Speaker 1] (2:06:02 - 2:06:04)
All right, let's carry on.

[Speaker 35] (2:06:06 - 2:06:08)
All right. Janet, why don't you proceed?

[Speaker 1] (2:06:10 - 2:06:12)
I think we're promoting her, so it might be a second.

[Speaker 22] (2:06:21 - 2:08:45)
Okay, I think I'm on the panelist now. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, and good morning, everybody. I am Janet Stengel.

I'm also an attorney at Gaspin and Almond, located at the same address that Bridget provided. Also with us is Kate Piatt-Eckert, our executive director of our client, Steve Theodore, and Peter Moore, artistic director of our client, Steve Theodore, and Monica Chata, who is the architect and a principal at Civics Projects Architecture. Our client, Steve Theodore Company, seeks approval of a rezoning application for a change in zoning for the property located at 5300-5318 North Kenmore Avenue for a change in zoning from an RM5 residential multi-unit district to a B11 neighborhood shopping district.

The property is located at the northwest corner of Bourbon and Kenmore. Excuse me, Steve Theodore Company has been located in Edgewater since 2008, and when a property developer bought their former location, which was also on Bourbon Avenue, almost two blocks away, closer to Broadway Street, Steve Theodore began looking for a new home. They were thrilled to find a location also in Edgewater at the property that we are presenting today.

The purpose of this rezoning, therefore, is to allow development of a small entertainment venue for Steve at that location. The property formerly operated as a Christian Science Reading Room, which closed in 2021. Steve Theodore proposes to reuse the existing 3,500-square-foot building for a 70-seat theater.

You can go ahead and change slides, please. There are approximately 13 parking spaces in the rear of the property. There is an existing gravel lot, which Steve Theodore plans to use.

Steve also intends for cars to enter on Kenmore Avenue and exit the property on Bourbon Avenue. Steve Theodore participated in an extensive community process facilitated by Alderman Osterman. We can go ahead and change slides, please.

This slide shows a rendering of the proposed Steve Theodore. Our community process included an open house hosted by Steve and two virtual community meetings. We'd like to thank Alderman Osterman for his time and his efforts in moving this process forward.

We are grateful to have his support. And as we've seen him speak earlier, he is here today. Thank you, and we appreciate your time and happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (2:08:47 - 2:08:48)
All right, Alderman Osterman.

[Speaker 8] (2:08:50 - 2:09:28)
Yes, just really wanna say that this is a win-win for our community. Steve Theodore has been an amazing theater company in our neighborhood. I wanna thank Kate and Peter from Steve.

Their building was sold. They looked all over the place and they found a new home half a block from their original site. And to my colleagues, this is a former Christian science reading room building that would have been a tall redevelopment.

Instead, it's gonna be an amazing community theater in our neighborhood. It's a great example of an adaptive reuse. So I would ask the committee support of this zoning change.

[Speaker 1] (2:09:30 - 2:09:42)
Thank you, Alderman. Did I see in one of the slides an addition that's gonna be part of this or is that already in the, yeah. Proposed future addition?

[Speaker 22] (2:09:44 - 2:09:57)
Yes, there is a possibility of a proposed future addition. Our client will work within the B-1-1 neighborhood shopping district standards for this. This is something that they are discussing for the future.

[Speaker 1] (2:09:58 - 2:10:02)
Great, all right. Questions, comments by my colleagues?

[Speaker 6] (2:10:05 - 2:10:07)
Motion to pass, Chairman, if there's no questions.

[Speaker 1] (2:10:07 - 2:11:03)
Alderman Wagesvek makes motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Thank you. Congratulations. I'm envious of retaining and expanding theater in your ward.

All right. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yep, all right. Middle of page three. All right, I'm gonna document number 21-000, 47th Ward, ordinance was deferred April 27th of 2022.

The address on this one is 4333 Northwestern. And I believe the attorney, Sarah Barnes, has asked this to be deferred. Sarah?

Yes or no? Yes or no?

[Speaker 5] (2:11:03 - 2:11:06)
Please, we are deferring. Thank you so much.

[Speaker 1] (2:11:06 - 2:11:49)
Can I get a motion to defer this item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? So moved by Alderman Cardona. Alderman Cardona makes the motion to defer.

Any objections? Hearing none, the item is deferred. All right, now we're on the bottom of page three, document number 21015.

Let me repeat that. 21015, T1, in the 33rd Ward, ordinance was deferred on April 27th of 2022. Common address 2820 through 2830 North Elston Avenue and the change request.

C12, Neighborhood Commercial District to C13, Neighborhood Commercial District. Sarah Barnes again. Sarah?

[Speaker 5] (2:11:50 - 2:15:10)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and esteemed members of the committee. For the record, my name is Sarah Barnes and I'm an attorney for Loss's Tampa Bay. I'm happy to be here today on behalf of the applicant 2820 North Elston Development, LLC.

Over the past year, we've been working very diligently with other women, Rodriguez Sanchez and all of the amazing community organizations that represent the Avondale and Bricktown neighborhoods towards the development proposal that you have before you here today. That development proposal will allow for the construction and occupation of a new five-story mixed-use building at the subject site. That building will be comprised of a total of just about 4,100 square feet of commercial and community space on the first floor with 40 dwelling units located and situated on and between the second through fourth floors.

In consideration of ongoing community engagement, I am happy to advise that of those 40 units, 16 of the units will be two-bedroom units and 12 of them will be three-bedroom units. And as well, in consideration of this proposal, the applicant has committed to providing 25% of the total units as affordable to families and individuals earning a 60% area median income in this neighborhood. And this is really intended to provide meaningful new affordable residences for the families of the Avondale and Bricktown neighborhoods.

We're really happy to have gotten to work with Alderwoman Rodriguez-Sanchez on that component of the new development. As well, in further considerations of kind of the community and making this a collaborative effort, the design for the new building does dedicate the entire south facade to the display of public artwork. And that will be commissioned by and through the Alderwoman's office and goes to local artists residing and working within the 33rd Ward.

So that's another exciting element, as well as dedicated community space on the first floor, which will feature free wifi and lounge areas for the public to partake as they see fit. And as well, a lot of bicycle parking. So again, over the last year, this has really become a collaborative effort with the community.

And I'm very happy to be here today with the support of Alderwoman Rodriguez-Sanchez and the other community members. And I do wanna commend the Alderwoman on facilitating such a robust community engagement regarding this project. It's one that I'm really proud of.

[Speaker 1] (2:15:10 - 2:15:12)
Thank you, Sarah.

[Speaker 5] (2:15:12 - 2:15:15)
With that, we respectfully request your support.

[Speaker 1] (2:15:15 - 2:15:24)
All righty. We do have a letter of support from Alderwoman Rodriguez-Sanchez. I see Alvin Waguespack with his hand up on this one.

Scott.

[Speaker 6] (2:15:25 - 2:15:47)
Thanks, Chairman. It sounds like a good project. Sarah, just one question.

That property has the alley and then it has a driveway, I think on both Diversity and on Elston. Did you guys modify that or would you have sort of the same setup?

[Speaker 5] (2:15:48 - 2:16:11)
Yeah, they're actually, we're gonna be having the curb cut on Elston so that won't be used anymore. And they're actually gonna add green space. That's gonna, that entire driveway is going to become a community garden area and dog walk.

And then the parking will be accessed via the public alley.

[Speaker 6] (2:16:11 - 2:16:16)
Great. Okay. I was just curious.

It's right next to the Golden.

[Speaker 5] (2:16:17 - 2:16:18)
Yeah, the restaurant.

[Speaker 6] (2:16:18 - 2:16:19)
Yeah.

[Speaker 5] (2:16:19 - 2:16:22)
Yeah, exactly. Yeah, we worked with them on the parking plan.

[Speaker 6] (2:16:23 - 2:16:26)
Great. Okay. Thank you, Chairman.

That's all I had. Thank you, Sarah.

[Speaker 5] (2:16:26 - 2:16:27)
Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (2:16:27 - 2:16:37)
Other questions? As I said, we do have a letter of support from Alderwoman Rodriguez-Sanchez. Can I get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 6] (2:16:38 - 2:16:39)
Moved to pass, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:16:39 - 2:17:18)
Alderman Waguespack makes the motion. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, this item is passed.

All right. Top of page four, document number 20922-T1 in the 47th Ward. Ordinance was referred on January 26th of 2022.

Common address is 1647-49 West Irving Park Road. To change request, B11 Neighborhood Shopping District to B23 Neighborhood Mixed Use District. Again, Sarah, on this item in the 47th Ward.

[Speaker 5] (2:17:20 - 2:17:56)
Good morning for the last time today. For the record, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, my name is Sarah Barnes and I'm an attorney at the Law Offices of Sam Banks. Happy to be here today on behalf of the Applicant Irving Class LLC.

Before I continue, Mr. Chairman, I would like to also note for the record that prior to these proceedings, I did tender a copy of a substitute narrative and substitute plan. So I would, to the Department of Planning and Development in further consideration of this application, I would ask therefore that those documents, those substitutes please be adopted into the record here today.

[Speaker 1] (2:17:57 - 2:18:12)
All right. Alderman Cardona moves to accept the substantive narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, the substantive narrative and plans are in front of us and accepted.

[Speaker 5] (2:18:15 - 2:19:23)
This proposal, which the subject property is located on a segment of Irving Park Road that is predominantly residential in nature and use. Therefore, we are seeking to redevelop the subject property with a new development that will be compatible with those existing uses. The proposal calls for the construction and occupation of a new four-story, eight-dwelling unit condominium building, which will feature off-street secured parking for eight vehicles.

We worked with Alderman Matthew Martin, as well as his 47th Ward Zoning Advisory Council and the North Center Neighborhood Association and the North Center Chamber of Commerce, all of which parties are in support of this proposal as it appears here today and in the substitute materials. And therefore, we would request the committee's favorable recommendation for this application. Mr. Chairman, I believe that Alderman Martin's office did tender a copy of a letter of support to your office yesterday.

[Speaker 1] (2:19:24 - 2:19:47)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Martin. Questions, comments from committee members? Moved to pass.

Alderman Dowell makes the motion moved to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed again with the substantive narrative and plans.

Thank you, Sarah. Have a good day.

[Speaker 5] (2:19:47 - 2:19:49)
Thank you, Chairman, you as well. Take care.

[Speaker 1] (2:19:50 - 2:20:33)
All right, moving on. We're in document number 21011, 47th Ward. Ordinance was referred on April 27th of 2022.

This common address, 2176 West Eastwood Avenue. The change request from an RS3, residential single unit detached house district to an RT4, residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district. All right, our witness here is Lori Orszczukowski.

I'm gonna leave it at that. So Lori, would you like to identify yourself and speak on this item on Eastwood Avenue, please?

[Speaker 25] (2:20:34 - 2:22:35)
Hello, Mr. Chairman and committee. Thank you for your time today. I'm Lori Orszczukowski, the owner and occupant of 2176 West Eastwood Avenue, Chicago 60625 in Lincoln Square.

It is currently a legal two-unit building for the past several decades, possibly half a century. The past owners who owned the property for 70 years had also constructed a third unit apartment in the attic, which they also rented out. So I'm asking for a zoning change from RS3 to RT4 for two reasons.

First, this will allow me to legalize and convert from two dwelling to three dwelling units. I should probably say that when I purchased the property, my mortgage lender did require, instead of 20% down, 25% down for three dwelling unit building and was also appraised as a three unit building. So I would like to renovate and beautify the building.

So the second reason is for the zoning change request is that I intend to renovate the building and add a dormer on the third floor so that the headroom in the stairs going up to the third floor unit will comply with building code. But the dormer addition is only gonna match the current height of the building at 37 feet and four inches so the square footage of the building is only gonna increase by less than 100 feet. I'm going to continue to occupy one of the units and would rent out the other two units.

And then I've also committed to Alderman Martin's office that I will work with him and the city to back zone after my construction project is complete.

[Speaker 1] (2:22:37 - 2:23:32)
All right, looks like a lot of work there. So appreciate your investment. I'm sure the Alderman does too.

Questions, comments from committee members? Hearing none, can I get a motion to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderman Cardona makes the motion.

Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the item is passed. Good luck, Lori.

All right. Thank you. Bottom of page four, document number 21018, 47th ward.

Ordinance was referred on April 27th of 2022. Common address 3904 North Hamilton Avenue in the change request. From an RS3, residential single unit detached house district to an RT4, residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district.

We have Katrina McGuire on this application. Katrina.

[Speaker 32] (2:23:33 - 2:24:06)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. Again, for the record, Katrina McGuire from Thompson Coburn here on behalf of the applicant. The goal here is to preserve the existing structure which dates back to 1905.

This allows the project to fully utilize the existing FAR as well as to build an addition, which will allow the rehab of the building to move forward. We do enjoy the support of the neighborhood group as well as Alderman Martin. And we, similar to the prior project, have agreed to revert the zoning back to the RS3 zoning when the project is complete.

[Speaker 1] (2:24:07 - 2:25:02)
All right, Katrina, we do have a letter of support from Alderman Martin. Questions for the application applicant? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move to pass for the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

So moved by Alderman Cardona. Alderman Cardona makes the motion. Any objections to his motion?

Hearing none, the item is passed. Thank you. We are on page five, top of page five, document number 21021 in the 47th ward.

Ordinance was referred on April 27th, 2022. Common address is 4748 to 4756 North Oakley. Also 2301 to 2305 West Lawrence Avenue.

The change request from a B11 neighborhood shopping district to a C11 neighborhood commercial district. We have Mr. Jack George on this item.

[Speaker 18] (2:25:02 - 2:25:12)
Mr. George. Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Jack George.

I'm an attorney and I'm with the Ackerman Law Firm, 71 South Wacker. I'm here this morning as you've indicated.

[Speaker 38] (2:25:13 - 2:25:13)
What's this?

[Speaker 18] (2:25:14 - 2:27:23)
Can you hear me Alderman? We can, loud and clear. I'm sorry.

I'm here on behalf of the Applicant Lewin Associates LLC. The subject property is located at 4748 to 4756 North Oakley and 2301 to 2305 West Lawrence. The existing zoning is B1-1 and we're seeking to change it to C1-1.

The site is an existing commercial shopping center known as the Square Shopping Center and it has a number of different tenants in there. What we're seeking to do is to lease one of the vacant units in the shopping center as an adult cannabis dispensary, but the B1 zoning for the property does not allow the adult use cannabis dispensary. And as a result, we're seeking to change the zoning from the existing to C1-1.

The tenant who will operate it is Botavi Wellness who will be partnering with the Justice Cannabis Company operating as DB, as Black Dispensary. As you know, Mr. Chairman, and all of the other aldermen on this phone know, this is something that has to then be required to be processed as a special use. And that is something that we will be doing.

But in order to do that, I first have to be able to change the zoning so that I comply with the zoning requirements. In this particular case, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I have met with Alderman Martin on this. We've had multiple meetings with the Alderman's office.

We've had meetings with the 47th Ward Advisory Committee. We've met with the Lincoln Square Neighbors Committee, the Lincoln Square Ravenswood Committee of Commerce. There was a general community meeting that I attended about three weeks ago.

I've had three meetings with the 19th District Police Department to discuss plans and they all are now supporting this project. And so all of these meetings have resulted in Alderman Martin giving me a letter of support for the project, which I think you probably have. I have a copy, but hopefully a copy has been given to you.

And so based on that, we're asking for the property to be rezoned and we would ask for your favorable support of this application and we thank you for your time.

[Speaker 1] (2:27:25 - 2:27:33)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Martin and I am sure there was a very detailed community process on this one. So.

[Speaker 18] (2:27:33 - 2:27:36)
There was Mr. Chairman, yeah.

[Speaker 1] (2:27:36 - 2:28:27)
Alrighty, questions for the applicants? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move to pass for the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? You pass, Alderman Cardona.

Alderman Cardona makes the motion. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, this item is passed.

All right, middle of page five, document number 20, I'm sorry, 21004, 33rd Ward. Ordinance was referred on April 27th of 2022. To commercial.

Felix, do you want to mute yourself, Felix? Okay. This common address, 3614 North Kedzie Avenue.

Change request from an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to C11 neighborhood commercial district.

[Speaker 18] (2:28:28 - 2:28:56)
