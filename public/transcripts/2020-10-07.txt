[Speaker 2] (3:21 - 3:33)
Good morning, Chairman. Good morning, everyone. Good morning.

Good morning, everyone.

[Speaker 1] (3:42 - 4:34)
Good morning, colleagues. I hope everyone had a very good night rest, so we can have a long, arduous meeting today. Look at you, Patrick.

I know you were in bed at 7 last night, were you not? All right, we're going to wait for a couple of more committee members. I think we're, and rest assured, it'll be a short meeting.

Good morning. Good morning, Carrie. How are you today?

Blessed and grateful. Aren't we all? Amen to that.

We woke up this morning. That's what I was just saying to Patrick Thompson. He looked like he had a really good night's sleep last night.

That blood pressure, Patrick, I'm telling you right now.

[Speaker 2] (4:35 - 5:58)
It's less red, isn't it? I think you just look fresh and bright eyed. Thanks, Maria.

Morning, everybody. Morning. Red you have on your pink?

I do, I do. It doesn't always show up. I'll send my picture to the group.

I feel like the colors, at least on my screen, look kind of weird. I always say that pink is not my color. Well, I'm also not really great with colors, so I am not technically colorblind.

But I just learned the other day that this jacket that I thought was like a nice burnt orange color is actually pink, which is totally fine. I've had it for like three years. And I was talking to my wife, and I was like, I think I'll wear the orange jacket.

And she's like, what orange jacket? And I go and get it. She's like, that is pink.

No, you claimed your color, Maria. Don't let them know. I think I just need more of the grays in life.

I think that's what it is. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, Tony.

Good morning.

[Speaker 1] (5:59 - 6:35)
Good morning. As you can see, there's a lot of camaraderie here this morning. Actually, we're doing social time together, so we should really try to be six feet apart and still in the room, so to speak, as Hamilton would say.

Because obviously, we all have a lot more in common than we have apart. Absolutely. The best city in the country.

So are we going to start? Are you looking at me, Tom, when you say that? I'm looking at you, my brother.

Where's your pink shirt? Yeah. You know, Jason, you wear pink so much better than I do.

OK?

[Speaker 2] (6:35 - 6:37)
I can't help it if you like the game, you know?

[Speaker 1] (6:37 - 6:43)
We're not going to have any labels, no pronouns, and none of that stuff. Right, Tony? Tony?

[Speaker 2] (6:44 - 7:11)
Not in it. Oh, not Mr. Pretty Man over there, eh? There you go.

Yeah. But if you want to wait a couple more minutes. No.

Lopez, where's your pink shirt, man? What's happening? They had a pink Hispanic heritage shirt.

I'd be all about that right now. Bruce Gessler and Demetrio.

[Speaker 1] (7:11 - 7:13)
We got to start before we get in trouble here.

[Speaker 2] (7:14 - 7:16)
No, before you get in trouble.

[Speaker 1] (7:17 - 7:49)
Exactly, exactly. All right, good morning. It's about 9.02 or something. The October 6, 2020 Committee on Zoning Landmarks and Building Standards is now reconvened. Pursuant to applicable law, the chairman has determined that an in-person meeting is not practical or prudent. Accordingly, attendance at this meeting will be by remote means only.

Are we doing a roll call? Yep. OK, so let's call the roll.

All right, let's start with Alderman Hopkins.

[Speaker 2] (9:07 - 9:10)

[Speaker 1] (9:11 - 9:16)
Is that Alderman Dowell? Yes. OK, so we have 16 members present.

[Speaker 2] (9:16 - 9:17)
Alderman Fullerstein is here, too.

[Speaker 1] (9:18 - 11:13)
Thank you. All right, we've got more than enough to begin the meeting. A quorum has been established.

So as we start the meeting, quickly I want to say thank you for everyone, your input on the air quality. Do we have a number of that ordinance? I think we do, just for the record.

The Clean Air Ordinance, 02020-4590. So we held this in committee yesterday, and I think after having a lot of discussion with a lot of you and the administration, I believe that more work needs to be done on this issue, both from what I say the left side of the brain and the right side of the brain. Obviously, there's concerns about the environmental air quality.

Nobody is interested in diminishing air quality. The other side of this is we've heard a lot from our business interests and the ability or the regulation of going to the ZBA more often than not. So I determined that we need more work to be done on the ordinance, and we will not be discussing this issue this morning at our 9 AM meeting.

So I'm going to ask for a motion to adjourn. Move to adjourn, Mr. Chairman. Vice Chairman Roboius makes a motion to adjourn.

And this meeting is adjourned, and we'll all see you in 10 o'clock. And I really appreciate you getting on the early morning call. Thank you.

[Speaker 2] (11:14 - 11:15)
Thank you. See you later.
