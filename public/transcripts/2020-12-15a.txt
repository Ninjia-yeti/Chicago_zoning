[Speaker 50] (11:14 - 11:18)
Mr. Goodman, please press star six on your phone to unmute.

[Speaker 1] (11:26 - 11:49)
Back to Kenneth. Our next speaker is Jackie Lowe. Jackie Lowe.

Is that you, Jackie? It is. Okay.

Good morning. You can proceed.

[Speaker 18] (11:50 - 14:35)
Good morning, Chairman Tunney and committee members. My name is Jackie Lowe. Regarding the proposed upzoning for the building at 4511 Clark Street, I respectfully request you delay the decision.

Why in the world are all you hearing from me and so many of my neighbors at this late stage of your process? Because that process was paused in March by COVID. The newly formed Clark Street Block Club may have had their say, but the nearby Clark Street commercial business owners and the people living directly behind 4511 North Clark Street on Dover Street did not get to finish the negotiation with MCZ Development.

My wife and I have spent 21 years rehabbing a single family historic home on the 4500 block of Dover Street. We're excited about the new development in our neighborhood and welcome the interest in investment in Uptown. But the zoning code was established for a reason and we support maintaining the current zoning for the 4511 Clark Street development, which doesn't come back up on your agenda until number 25.

So please take some notes or two here. I'm concerned about scale as it is crucial to our unique neighborhoods feel. Yes, it is a commercial corridor, but in our area, Clark Street's a little two lane street.

Currently, and for the past 100 years, it's been composed of mostly two and three story buildings that has all the elements to remain historic and charming. The current C1-2 zoning allows for a building up to four stories, appropriate to the scale of Clark Street. Ashland, on the other hand, also a commercial corridor to recently had a building built at 4747 North Ashland with the B3-3 zoning.

It's massive size is much more appropriate to the four lane commercial street of Ashland Avenue, then to that of Clark Street. Even though it is very late in the zoning game, I respectfully request that you press pause on this proposed development until the Clark Street corridor master plan that Alderman Kappelman, DTD, and Uptown United are working on is complete, and we can move forward with a more unified concept of what this unique stretch of Clark Street might become. Thank you so much for your attention to this.

[Speaker 1] (14:37 - 14:40)
Thank you, Jackie. Our next speaker is Jonathan Slovin.

[Speaker 12] (14:44 - 17:53)
Thank you so much, Alderman. My name is Jonathan Slovin, and I am a resident of 4522 North Dover Street. I'm also commenting on the 4511 North Clark Street development.

As Jackie mentioned, and I'm sure you'll hear more about the process of working with the Dover Street Block Club and then using the pandemic as cover to coordinate with another block club three blocks away is troubling and disheartening. The developers and the aldermen have said they wish to be good stewards to the local community, but this is not evident in their actions. Why not work to get the support or at least talk to personally, at minimum, the four homes that will be directly impacted by this development change.

I may not have agreed with everything they proposed, but at least I would have a personal connection. When developers updated the home directly next to us, they didn't need our permission whatsoever, but by creating a relationship with us, we were able to support one another as the process unfolded. As Jackie said, we want development in our area.

Instead, these developers worked with the president and founder of the block club three blocks away, who has yet to identify how many members there actually are in his group. Although he said they were unanimous in their support of this development, when pressed about how many members voted in favor, he never gave a straight answer. This is a problem.

The all-white, almost entirely male development committee that the aldermen assembled also is troubling. Many admitted they had never visited Sheridan Park, this historic part of Uptown, and had no understanding of the businesses or needs of the community. In fact, they were quite vocal with their disdain for the area.

We are not Lakeview, don't want to be, and have different needs. The alderman has said to my neighbor that he is, quote, putting a stop to any zoning changes until the study happens. The study he is referring to is the retail corridor study of Clark Street.

Why wouldn't we wait until this study is complete before approving this zoning change? It is inconsistent. It isn't consistent at all, excuse me.

With that, there was talk by the aldermen's committee that there are plenty of other buildings along Clark Street that have this similar and set a precedent. This is not true. There are a few other buildings that are three or four story stories, but none of them are up against single family homes.

I think this must be taken into consideration. Also, none of the other similar buildings have only one entrance for their garage, and in this instance, for 28 cars. This is a huge increase of cars coming in and out of one entrance in an already busy alley.

When asked if there was a study done about this impact, no response and no study was presented. This process has been rushed, forced through, and inconsistent with the alderman's own words. He says we need two more bedroom units in the area, and I completely agree.

But building a large building with only a handful of two bedroom units on a local two lane street up against historically designated homes that is not intended to sustain such an imprint is not the answer. I urge you to vote no for this zoning change. Thank you, Randy.

[Speaker 1] (17:54 - 17:58)
All right, Jonathan, I'm sorry. Next is Randy Wilson. Randy.

[Speaker 15] (18:01 - 21:03)
Alderman. Good morning. Thank you for taking.

Good morning. Thank you for taking the time to listen to my comments about 4511 North Clark Street. I'd like to start by addressing the inadequate infrastructure that already exists just behind this building where I live.

At least three times a year we have raw sewage backing up into our basement. Adding a more dense residential building will not help this at all and will likely make it worse. Unlike most residential buildings in Chicago, our building and the whole block sewage plumbing goes to the alley, not the street.

I would ask that prior to approving the zoning change, sewage issues be investigated and remedied. The alley is already heavily trafficked. Many residents use the alley to access parking and much of the time the alley has traffic that must yield to someone traveling in the opposite direction.

Currently, this is not a problem. However, with more parking off the alley, it will quickly become a problem. Residents will have reduced ingress and egress from the alley.

The three businesses that currently rent these storefronts bring diversity and color to the ward that is lacking in business ownership. These businesses both compete with and complement each other. There are many people that shop in these businesses that do not come from the ward, but from other wards that lack this diversity.

With a block ensemble theater less than a block south, I would think that as a community and as a city, we would want businesses owned by people of color and immigrants to thrive in the area, especially after investing TIF funds into the black ensemble theater. We have an opportunity to let businesses owned by people of color and immigrants thrive. This proposal would be devastating to those businesses already located on the block as well as surrounding businesses owned by minorities.

Since this proposal has been approved by a block club whose members are two blocks away, the next property south has been listed for sale and this listing touts that an upzone would likely be approved since this proposal has gotten through neighborhood groups and the alderman's office. This couldn't be further from the truth as this upzone was not approved by the neighborhood groups, but from one block club that has no member to speak up on the 4500 block of Clark. In approving this zoning change, the committee would be pushing the first domino of a long line of property changes that would upend mostly businesses owned by people of color or immigrants on Clark Street.

This proposal also runs counter to the ward master plan. The plan points to a lack of families in uptown and sees that fact as a negative on page 20 of the plan and calls for housing for middle income families with children. Given the lack of multi-bedroom units in this proposal, this will not be an outcome from the development.

The master plan specifically calls on larger units to be added to the ward on page six in the economic section. In summation, diminished property values for the surrounding homeowners, the infrastructure issues, traffic noise, and the damage to diversity in nearby businesses mean this upzone should be thought of not as a positive, but should be paused until we know it will be a positive for the developer, the surrounding residents, and local businesses. I urge you all to pause this development until solutions to the problems that have been pointed out have been solved.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (21:04 - 21:07)
Thank you, Randy. Our next speaker is Dieter Zabel.

[Speaker 14] (21:13 - 24:18)
Good morning, Alderman. My name is Dieter Zabel. My name is Dieter Zabel.

I'm property owner on 462628 North Dover Street. I'm an architect, so I'm a little bit involved in zoning changes and stuff like that. So what I'm going to say, I'm proposing or more or less requesting to delay or pause the zoning change of the 4511-4523 project until a comprehensive Clark Street corridor master plan will be established.

Without that, it is going completely the wrong way of the nature of urban planning and where the responsibilities of zoning. To allow for a zoning change now at this point of time to favor a five-story high structure is just wrong. And it is setting a precedence of other properties on Clark Street waiting to be developed.

So if they are getting the message, zoning change seems to be very easy to get pushed through. We are ending up with a super high-density development along Clark Street. The height of the proposed project is out of scale for the neighborhood as we see it or as I see it.

And when other projects follow, the east side of Clark Street will become a canyon wall. Other areas in Chicago have seen that before, so it was kind of a two, one, two, or three story buildings and all of a sudden they have a wall of five, six, up to ten stories buildings. The density of the project was 56 units and now calculated that way, that probably is you can add a factor of 1.5 residents per unit. That will equal 84 people added to the neighborhood, which is a significant amount of people to the existing infrastructure like water, sewer, electricity, gas, but also other services like shopping areas, parking, congestion of airbies, and one has to be mindful as a city planner to see the consequences, not just of one project, but also of the original.

[Speaker 1] (24:19 - 24:24)
Thank you, Dieter. Our next speaker is Jay Sidney Puryar.

[Speaker 17] (24:28 - 24:54)
Hi, good morning. Good morning. Can you hear me?

We can. Proceed. Okay, great.

Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for hearing my comments. I will be essentially echoing the comments you have heard from others.

I am a resident of North Silver Street. My property is located just behind the proposed development. And as with everyone else, I would ask everyone on this council.

[Speaker 1] (24:55 - 24:57)
Jay, could you identify yourself on the record, please?

[Speaker 17] (24:58 - 27:21)
Sure. My name is Jay Sidney Puryar. Thank you.

The last name is P-E-R-Y-A-R. Again, at 4522 North Dover Street, directly behind this project, and I am opposed to it. As my neighbors have mentioned from a process standpoint, I feel as though the process getting here today has been extremely flawed in terms of the lack of reach out to any of us here to gain our concerns about what this project would mean to us.

I won't go through the list of the issues with that, but I needless to say, as was articulated, the subcommittee that did approve this, in voicing their disdain for the neighborhood itself, mentioning that they had only perhaps some of them driven by the neighborhood on occasion without actually understanding what this neighborhood means to us, how we value the diversity of it, how we value the businesses, which are family owned, minority owned, immigrant owned businesses, the clientele being very diverse.

With that said, again, I feel as though at this point in time, we need to hit pause on this project, not move forward with it. We do have a master plan for this neighborhood. I won't rearticulate all of the things that have been said, but I will share a brief personal story.

When I moved to this neighborhood eight years ago now from downtown Chicago in a largely dense area, I can tell you coming to a neighborhood where the neighbors knew each other, where there was actually sky you could see, where there are families, I see parents walking their kids to school. This is what drew me and I'm sure a number of other neighbors to this location, to this neighborhood to be a part of something. We have invested collectively millions of dollars, blood, sweat, and tears into developing this neighborhood into what it is today.

We do not want our neighborhood sacrificed for some outside developers who are looking to make a quick profit. We really do value what we have. We want to see development within the current zoning.

So I am asking even Alderman Kappelman to tell the developers to come back to the drawing board and work with the neighbors, but to hit pause and oppose this measure for now. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (27:22 - 27:24)
Thank you. Our next speaker is Patrick Phelan.

[Speaker 13] (27:31 - 27:33)
Good morning, Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (27:34 - 27:34)
Morning.

[Speaker 13] (27:36 - 30:36)
Patrick Phelan from 4542 North Dover Street. I am here to talk about a document that was presented to the written comments and to explain a little bit beyond that document. It's the represented results of 250 feet or one block of the proposals of the proposal in regards to 4511 and 23 North Clark Street.

The Dover Street neighbors were informed about a week before the zoning ward zoning committee and the neighbors on Clark Street were informed about three days before the meeting as a result of a petition circulated by a couple owners on Clark Street and myself and the results of the petition and then the voting on Dover Street in regards to this proposal resulted in this document that shows that in the 4500 block of Clark Street, there were eight owners that opposed the development and would like to have a pause on this today.

On Dover Street, there were 16 property owners that were against this and is asking for a pause today. The Clark Street eight property owners consist of retail stores, wholesale stores, liquor stores, cleaners, and, um, have been in the street since 1970s. They are, uh, have a background of, they came from Korea, the Middle East, um, Pakistan, um, and Mexico, and they are very concerned in regards to, uh, the recent changes and their proposal proposal opposing it as a result of its height density and lack of parking.

They are particularly, um, concerned that they were not informed of any information and still have not been reached out to by anyone in regards to this development. In regards to the Clark Street, I mean, excuse me, regards to Dover Street. Um, we were in the process in March and, uh, somehow it was taken away from us.

[Speaker 1] (30:37 - 30:42)
Thank you, Patrick. Um, our next speaker, Cynthia, uh, Asgar.

[Speaker 10] (30:47 - 33:52)
Good morning, everyone. My name is Cynthia Asgar. I own the building at 4653 North Clark Street.

That building has three rental incomes in it, a storefront, which I would encourage you to go to if you're ever in the neighborhood. It's got every Marvel and DC comic character and the collectibles. It's also a phone store.

My property also has that large garage on the back that's for tire repair and auto repair, and then there's an apartment upstairs. My husband and I own this building for 26 years, and I wasn't that involved in the but he passed away in February. So I've been more involved and I walked that street talking to all my neighbors.

And to a person, not a single business owner or building owner on that two, three block area on Clark Street knew about this MC, MCV five-story building. They had even had a courtesy notification from the Alderman. And I'm just very concerned about this process because these are immigrant citizens of America who came here generations ago.

Some of them, their parents came and bought these buildings and they have continued to have these vibrant wholesale retail businesses in that block. They're all shrewd business people. They have ridden every downturn and upswing in the economy since then.

And they have kept those buildings and those businesses going. And the thing is the economics about those two flats or three flats, when there's a downturn and you're not having as many sales in your storefront, that rental income upstairs is critical. And the balance of a five story, you know, I just would wish that the zoning committee would have that balance perspective, the balance of looking at the historic nature of a neighborhood and the future vision for the neighborhood.

If you put a five story building in there with all those apartments, these other long term taxpayers and property owners may have a harder time renting their units and that income from their rental units. Sometimes it's a family member, but often not, um, is critical to their survival. I mean, if your goal is to have this whole neighborhood gradually wiped out over the next 10 to 20 years and just have towers of apartment buildings in, then, you know, maybe that's what the intent is really here.

If you want to preserve the charm of this neighborhood and the multicultural vibrancy of it, then I would encourage you to scale that building back a little bit and really try to balance the economic and investment needs of that neighborhood. All those business people that I talked to, all those property owners, they're very excited about investment in that neighborhood, but they just, they're, you know, they would like to be a part of the process and they would like, thank you.

[Speaker 1] (33:53 - 34:07)
Thank you, Cynthia. Our next speaker is Sandra Fontanez. Sandra Fontanez.

[Speaker 8] (34:13 - 34:14)
Please press star six to unmute.

[Speaker 1] (34:22 - 34:33)
All right. I'm going to go back to Kenneth Goodman. He was our first speaker that did not respond.

Kenneth Goodman.

[Speaker 20] (34:34 - 34:36)
Hello, this is Sandra.

[Speaker 1] (34:36 - 34:41)
All right, Sandra, you can start. Thank you.

[Speaker 20] (34:41 - 37:15)
Okay. I was having trouble. Don't know why.

Good morning. I'm Sandra Fontanez Phelan. I'm an urban pioneer.

I've been on Dover since the early 80s. I'm at 4542 Dover. Love the neighborhood.

I have some concerns again, and my speech is going to be shorter because a lot of folks have hit some of my points, but I'm also concerned regarding the recent activities for development on Clark and specifically for the 451123. Again, oversized, dense character, not looking at history, not looking at the historical area, not believing in the existing buildings or the neighborhood. I don't understand why we're pushing this.

We are vested in our community. We want what you want, development, progress, yet there must be a plan, and that's been stated. There must be a plan, but it must be with community input.

We live this every day. We're here every day. We believe in living in our neighborhood.

We enjoy this here. We can't do this one building at a time. This does not make sense.

It's not a vision. It's not a plan, and to omit the community is an unbelievable process, and it has happened in this particular project. Now, we've walked and talked to all of our neighbors, and we do visit the stores on Clark, and so we're very active in the community.

Yes, they're minority businesses, and they're a little bit shyer to come on board, and they could be telling you firsthand of their fears, so I'm going to quote one of my neighbors on Clark who owns a tzatzal restaurant, and that would be Teresa, who owns tzatzal. I recently reinvested in my community by doing a major renovation on my building and my home because many of the businesses also live over their building, over their business. I'm afraid that big money development will push me out.

Oversized buildings will take away the quaintness and the history from the street. Bigger is not always better, and I may not be able to compete against that, so basically a lot of us are saying the same thing. Keep the zoning where it is.

Make a plan. Make this make sense for our community. We are here to participate.

Work hard. We'll get on committees. We'll do the work, but don't shut us out.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (37:17 - 38:11)
And thank you, Sandra, and I'm just going to one last call for Kenneth Goodman. All right, Kenneth. Three times and you're out, so all right.

That concludes the public commentary portion of the meeting. We are now going to start today with the addendum to the agenda. Document number 02020-5007, a text amendment from Alderman Michelle Smith regarding the amendment of Municipal Code Section 2-120-910, modifying fines and remedies for disrepair of historical and architectural landmarks.

Landmarks. My understanding, we have a substitute on this matter. Alderman Roboyes moves to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

[Speaker 25] (38:12 - 38:15)
Chairman Tony, Alderman David Moore is here for the purposes of quorum.

[Speaker 1] (38:15 - 38:17)
Thank you, David, for the quorum. Thank you, sir.

[Speaker 25] (38:18 - 38:19)
Alderman Cardenas.

[Speaker 1] (38:20 - 38:23)
And Alderman Cardenas is here, too. All right, so.

[Speaker 5] (38:24 - 38:25)
Alderman Burnett is here also.

[Speaker 1] (38:25 - 38:35)
Alderman Walter Burnett is here. So on the motion by Alderman Roboyes to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum, any objections?

[Speaker 29] (38:35 - 38:36)
So moved.

[Speaker 1] (38:38 - 38:52)
Objections? Hearing none, the substitute is before us. We have Alderman Michelle Smith to testify in the matter.

Alderman, good morning, Michelle.

[Speaker 4] (38:53 - 42:19)
Good morning, Chairman, and thank you very much. Everyone, I hope, has a copy of the substitute. This is a matter that is solely restricted to landmark districts, and we have had a pattern in our community, and I know we're not alone, in districts that have been lovingly landmarked over the years of having owners who choose to neglect their properties and, in fact, sometimes take affirmative steps to undermine their own buildings so that they can get an emergency order from the city to allow them to be torn down in hopes of achieving a bigger or easier financial payout. So this has happened several times in my ward, and most recently over the spring, we learned that we had a development author for a particular building that was conditioned on the building being demolished.

And when we discovered that, and it's in a landmark district, we ran to the scene and found that there had been a pattern of buildings, of a building being undermined. So we tried to get not just an inspection, which we did, which found that the building was on the verge of being structurally unsound, but we couldn't, the city didn't have the power to have a structural engineer be required to go on site to see whether the building could be short. So this ordinance does two things.

First of all, it fills that gap by allowing a building that is in a state of disrepair to qualify for legal action. And then it also changes the fines for if you are found to have allowed your building to collapse. Now, the original ordinance, something like tripled the fines, because frankly, at least in our community and in many other gentrifying communities, you know, the real estate has suddenly become even more valuable than it was before.

We did receive some comments from aldermen and from the law department about the wisdom of making the fines that large. So the substitute, instead of something like tripling the fines, which the original ordinance did, we do double the fines. Now, of course, these fines are subject to negotiation in court, but we are hoping, I'm asking for your support, because when a community does support landmarking and does decide that it go forward, that it should be for real.

And, you know, when the community doesn't support landmarking, that's a completely other story. But once you make that decision, we think that the city should have the tools to prevent owners from undermining their own buildings to cause them to fall down, which is what has happened in several cases, certainly in my ward and I know about others. So thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I ask the support of the committee for this one more tool in the tool chest for our law department. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (42:20 - 42:28)
Thank you, Alderman. Do we have questions from committee members? I see Alderman Brendan Riley's hand up.

Brendan?

[Speaker 31] (42:29 - 43:01)
Thank you, Chairman. I think this sounds like a great ordinance. As someone who represents a bunch of landmark districts, I've seen similar scenarios play out in my ward, and it's disappointing, you know, unscrupulous developers demolishing from within these important historic structures.

So certainly I want to do everything we can to give the city more tools to protect them. I had one question, Alderman Smith, and that is what are the current fines and what will doubling them take them to?

[Speaker 4] (43:01 - 43:06)
I think it's $1,000 to $2,000, and it'll make it from $2,000 to $4,000.

[Speaker 31] (43:08 - 44:08)
And is that fine schedule? Does it escalate if they're found, you know, to have done this more than once? My experience is that there are bad actors.

Not everyone does this. Only a handful of developers do it. But the ones that do it, I think, do it chronically.

And so I just love if we have, you know, chronic bad actors, another tool to get after those folks who are habitual versus the person who innocently screws up, you know? So I'm certainly going to support this ordinance, but maybe that's something that we can look at with the law department in the future, because I think we all know there are a handful of developers who do not do the right thing. And the longer they get away with it, it simply adds, it's a disincentive for those folks who do things properly.

So I'm all for this. Thank you, Alderman Smith, for bringing it to our attention, and I plan on voting for it. And hopefully we can work on going after the chronic bad actors in the future.

Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (44:10 - 44:21)
Thank you. Thank you, Alderman Riley. Any other questions?

I know we have Grant from the building department on if there's questions for the department. So anybody else, questions?

[Speaker 21] (44:25 - 44:27)
Move to pass, Chairman. Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 1] (44:27 - 44:58)
All right. Hearing no questions by committee members, Alderman Lopez moves do pass as amended by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that motion?

Hearing none, the item is passed as amended. Congratulations, Alderman. We'll be back with you in a few minutes.

We've got a couple of things to do before we get your Alderman Smith. All right.

[Speaker 52] (44:58 - 44:58)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (44:59 - 45:18)
Next, we have one landmark fee waiver today in the 28th Ward, document number OR2020-325 for the property commonly known as 1035 South Claremont. We have Michelle Rimes from the Department of Planning here to testify on the matter.

[Speaker 35] (45:19 - 46:31)
Michelle? Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. I am Michelle Rimes.

I am with the Historic Preservation Division of the Department of Planning and Development. The item before you is for a permit fee waiver in the amount of $3,000 for $400,000 being expended by the property owners, Lori and Joseph Christopher. Their building is located at 1035 South Claremont Avenue.

The structure is located in the Claremont Cottages District that was landmarked by the City of Chicago in November of 2019. The Christophers seek the permit fee waiver to make improvements to their mechanical systems, the heating, plumbing, and air conditioning to do some roof replacement work, tuck pointing and brick repair, wall plastering, and other such improvements. This project is supported by Alderman Jason Irvin, the Alderman of the 28th Ward.

[Speaker 1] (46:33 - 47:01)
Thank you, Michelle. Questions from committee members? I don't have a question, but the comment that seems like a very huge investment, a $400,000 investment, and I think the permit waiver is more than justified on that.

So, that is my comment. Any questions? Committee members?

Do I get a motion to move?

[Speaker 29] (47:01 - 47:02)
So moved, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (47:03 - 47:13)
I call for a determined quorum. That was Alderman Roboyas. The move do pass.

Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed. Thank you, Michelle.

[Speaker 35] (47:14 - 47:16)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and committee members.

[Speaker 1] (47:17 - 47:38)
Moving on, we have one large sign over 100 square feet in area, 24 feet above grade, located in the 11th Ward at 645 West Roosevelt Road. Questions by committee members? Hearing no questions, do I get a motion to move?

Do pass by the same roll call that was used?

[Speaker 49] (47:38 - 47:39)
Moved to pass, Alderman Waguespack.

[Speaker 1] (47:40 - 48:48)
Alderman Waguespack moves do pass. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

All right, now we'll move on to the regular agenda in an effort to minimize technical difficulties and to ensure the committee meeting runs as smoothly as possible. The typical order in which items will be heard has been updated throughout the duration of virtual committee and zoning meetings. Items will be grouped together according to the witness attorney and will be heard in that order rather than in ward order.

So, that being said, we will be on page one and I'll read the document number A as an Aldermanic 8612, 43rd Ward. Ordinance was referred on October 7th of 2020. Common address, 2017 North Cleveland Avenue and the change request, the B32 Community Shopping District to an RS3 residential single unit detached house district.

Alderman Michelle Smith.

[Speaker 4] (48:50 - 48:55)
Alderman Tony, I believe the address is 2107, not 2017.

[Speaker 1] (48:55 - 49:06)
Okay, okay. Let's double check. Well, why don't we proceed and then we'll make sure it's on a record that we have the right address.

Okay.

[Speaker 4] (49:06 - 50:19)
Yes, thank you. So, this is a building that was unfortunately allowed to fall down and in a very unusual settlement. While this isn't a residential perspective, it's an R5 or it was originally a B3.

It had been a one-story building on this site. So, as part of our efforts to defend our landmark districts, we downzoned. We are moving to downzone this property to an R3.

And as part of the litigation that was threatened in connection with this, what we believe was a abuse of a landmark district, we agreed that the property owner has agreed to the downzoning. So, we are very pleased with this outcome and think it is a tool, again, that aldermen do use to try to control their communities and a very worthy one here. So, I'd like to ask for your support for this rezoning of this area.

[Speaker 1] (50:20 - 50:49)
Thank you, aldermen. And just for the record, you're right, it's 2107 North Cleveland. It was noticed properly on the clerk's website.

So, it was our transposition of those numbers. So, it is correct at 2107 North Cleveland. All right, questions for the aldermen?

Hearing no questions. Can I get a motion to move do pass?

[Speaker 2] (50:50 - 50:52)
Alderman Kaplan moves do pass.

[Speaker 1] (50:53 - 51:09)
All right. All right. So, Alderman Kaplan moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections to that motion? Hearing none, the item is passed. Thank you, Michelle.

[Speaker 4] (51:09 - 51:11)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (51:11 - 51:36)
Our next item is Aldermanic Ordinance 8614, 46th Ward. The ordinance was referred on October 7th of 2020. Common address, 1023 West Irving Park Road.

The change request, a B23 neighborhood mixed-use district to a B25 neighborhood mixed-use district. Alderman Kaplan.

[Speaker 2] (51:38 - 51:49)
Thank you so much, Chairman Tunney. I'm wondering if I could defer to Patrick Murphy to explain the situation, if he's available.

[Speaker 33] (51:51 - 51:52)
Yes, not a problem, Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (51:53 - 51:56)
All right, Patrick, you want to speak to the committee?

[Speaker 33] (51:57 - 53:16)
Sure. So, back in 2015, there was a zoning map amendment that was approved for a type one project that was for a retail, I'm sorry, residential building. That project started construction, but did not proceed and was not completed.

In between that time and the time that a permit was issued a few months ago by the department, a zoning map error was done by staff. We incorrectly mapped the project as a B25, I'm sorry, mapped the parcel as B25 instead of B23. The permit that was issued a few months ago was reviewed through no fault of the applicant under the B2-5 zoning and was correctly approved.

However, the zoning map error was not discovered until after the permit had been issued. We discussed it with the law department. We discussed it with the applicant and the alderman.

And because the applicant had proceeded in good faith and had already gotten their permit and had already started their project, the best recourse was to rezone the property so it would not be a non-conforming project, not be a non-conforming building, and then correctly update the zoning map now so that it reflects the proper zoning, which in this case would be the B25 that was erroneously labeled a few years back.

[Speaker 1] (53:18 - 53:21)
Thank you, Patrick. Alderman?

[Speaker 2] (53:23 - 53:43)
Thank you, Chairman. So given these circumstances and given the incredible mission of Howard Brown and the Broadway View Center and all the work that they do for the LGBTQ plus community, I ask my colleagues to support this and correct this matter. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (53:43 - 53:53)
Thank you, alderman. Questions for the alderman? Hearing no questions, can I get a motion to move to pass by the same?

[Speaker 44] (53:53 - 53:55)
I'll do pass.

[Speaker 1] (53:55 - 55:06)
To determine quorum. Alderman Cardona moves to pass. Any objections to his motion?

Hearing no objections, the item is passed. Thank you, Alderman Kappelman. I do want to echo my support.

Obviously, you mentioned the Broadway View Center. They have been pillars in the community, and I think what they're doing here is going to be really an asset to yours and the entire Northside's LGBT community. Thank you for that.

All right. Bottom of page one. Next item is aldermanic 8605 First Ward.

Ordinance was referred on September 9th of 2020. The common address 2948 through 2954 West Armitage. Also 2001 through 2011 North Humboldt Boulevard.

The change request is the C13 neighborhood commercial district to a C12 neighborhood commercial district. This is in Alderman LaSvada's First Ward. Alderman LaSvada.

[Speaker 51] (55:16 - 55:19)
Chairman, I don't think Alderman LaSvada is on the meeting.

[Speaker 1] (55:19 - 56:06)
All righty. Well, then we're going to hold this. Okay, so we'll hold this until he hopefully joins us.

So now we are on the top of page two. Aldermanic application 8497 35th Ward. The ordinance was referred on July 24th of 2019.

Common address is 2643 to 2651 North Milwaukee Avenue. And this change request is from a B33 community shopping district to B31 community shopping district. This is in the 35th Ward.

Alderman Ramirez Rosa.

[Speaker 44] (56:07 - 56:51)
Yes, thank you so much, Chairman Tunney. This rezoning ordinance is part of the larger community land use and zoning plan that we have for my community, which seeks to preserve the existing built environment. Uncap future development to three stories along this stretch.

On June 25th, I met with our zoning administrator, Patrick Murphy, who looked at all of these ordinances. And he reviewed an analysis of our community's land use and zoning policy and said that they were good to go. So I appreciate the communities.

I appreciate the zoning committee support on my community enacting our land use and zoning policy.

[Speaker 1] (56:53 - 56:56)
Thank you, Alderman. Questions for the Alderman?

[Speaker 29] (56:59 - 57:00)
No move, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (57:00 - 58:04)
All right. Hearing no question, Second that. Roboyas moves to do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections to that motion? Hearing none, the item is passed. All right.

We are on the middle of page two. This is document number 20349, 16th Ward. Ordinance was referred on February 19th of 2020.

Common address is 2240 West 63rd Street. And the change request is a B31 Community Shopping District, M12 Limited Manufacturing Business Park District, and C22 Motor Vehicle Related Commercial District, all to an M21 Light Manufacturing District, and then to a Manufacturing Planning District. This is, we have Larry Adelson on this project.

[Speaker 3] (58:06 - 58:47)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, commissioners. My name's Lawrence Adelson. I'm an attorney with the law firm of Chico and Nunes.

We represent the applicant, CSX Transportation, which is CSX Railroad. I have with me today, thank you for that first slide, Tom Livingston and some of his associates from CSX Railroad. If they're on, they can give you a little background on CSX and how this project fits into their massive commitment to the Chicago Terminal.

[Speaker 40] (58:48 - 59:44)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Chairman Tunney, members of the committee. Tom Livingston here with colleagues in the 16th Ward, live from our terminal at 59th Street. We want to thank Alderman Stephanie Coleman and the partnership with the City of Chicago all year on the Create Project.

We, in essence, are talking about an existing piece of property next to our terminal that we would clean up, light, improve, and make other improvements. Right now, as we speak, we are in our peak season with our intermodal and agricultural harvest shipments, and Chicago continues to play a very important role in the global shipments. So I'm going to turn over to Ray Harris to talk more about the project, and we'll keep moving here.

[Speaker 28] (59:45 - 59:46)
Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone.

[Speaker 1] (59:46 - 59:54)
Well, let me just interrupt you for a second. I believe this item passed in plan commission. Is that correct?

[Speaker 40] (59:55 - 59:56)
Yes, it has.

[Speaker 1] (59:56 - 1:00:16)
Okay. So I need a motion to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Alderman Lopez moves to pass on that request.

Any objections? Hearing none, the records are incorporated. Okay.

So let's continue.

[Speaker 28] (1:00:20 - 1:01:54)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CSX's Chicago presence is part of the company's national network that connects nearly every eastern U.S. metropolitan area where two-thirds of the nation population lives with the rest of the global economy. CSX employs more than 500 people in the state working in various management and operational roles.

This month, CSX earned a place on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index with across-the-board honors in environmental, social, governance, and economic scores. We are the only U.S. railroad to make the index and rank in the top 15 transportation companies on their worldwide list. In addition, CSX is the first railroad to reach agreement with the Science-Based Targets Initiative, which is an aggressive program to reduce greenhouse gases by 30% over the next 10 years.

In Chicago, we support several charities across the city and we enjoy those partnerships. As it relates to employment, we have a 64% minority and female workforce in northeast Illinois. At this time, I'd like to turn it over to Janet Davies, the Senior Terminal Manager of the 59th Street Facility where we're located.

[Speaker 41] (1:01:55 - 1:02:51)
Thank you, Ray, and good morning. I serve as the Senior Terminal Manager of the 59th Street Intermodal Terminal, located at 2101 West 59th Street. Our terminal is immediately adjacent to the property we are seeking your approval on and has a direct impact on our viability as a transportation hub on the south side of Chicago.

I've been at the 59th Street Terminal since 2011. We handle about 500 inbound trucks and service six trains per day. We have nine overhead cranes and three side loaders that load and unload goods.

We are a 24-7 terminal, opened in 1999 on the site of a long-abandoned rail yard. Presently, the only access to our terminal, which you see on current conditions, is off of 59th Street. We have approximately 100 individuals who work as either contractors or employees of CSX.

The new property will keep CSX 59th Street viable and therefore retain the many jobs I just mentioned. There will be approximately 400 construction jobs on the new surface lot and an investment of $27 million. I will now call upon Larry Adelson to discuss current and planned conditions for the site.

[Speaker 3] (1:02:52 - 1:07:41)
Thank you, Ms. Davies. If we could go back to slide two. This gives you the context of the yard.

It's in red. The green are the major streets, Damon at the north, Western at the south, and 59th to your left as you look at it, 63rd to your right. The entrance will be on 63rd.

CSX has assembled this 20-acre site. It took them a while. This is a brownfield site.

CSX has entered it into the IEPA voluntary program to remediate it. So that's a significant plus for this neighborhood is to take a very undevelopable site out of the brownfield condition and improve it, bring it into economic use, create jobs and economic activity. It preserves the frontage on Western for continued retail use.

The exit and entrance will be on 63rd Street. We worked with CDOT on the entrance conditions. CSX has a state-of-the-art gating system which allows trucks to move off the street into a holding area.

The truckers use their cell phones to get entry to the yard and get directed to where the container is that they're going to be picking up. The activity in this yard will be shipping containers, which are brought in by rail, unloaded in the 59th Street yard, and then moved in through an internal road from 59th Street yard to 63rd Street yard, where they then get distributed out onto the street grid. There was a traffic study done.

We worked with CDOT to have that done. And the impact on traffic relative to the existing traffic and the capacity of 63rd is pretty minor. In addition, CSX has committed to a variety of way above standard improvements.

If we could go down to slide five, this is an example of the screening. There's extensive tree planning at the suggestion of Commissioner Cox and his staff, so that when you're driving down Western Avenue and looking through the parking lots, you'll see some greenery. And then if you could pull up slide five, that shows you this is a scheme that the Commissioner Cox and his department came up with to plant extensive vegetation on 63rd Street.

It still preserves the visibility that you need for traffic safety with the trucks coming off and on, but you're looking at a nice landscaped area instead of fencing and containers. So it's a pretty nice add to the community. It allows CSX to...

CSX has been operating in this neighborhood for 20 years quite successfully. They're a good neighbor, a good part of the community. This allows them to expand in this community.

This is one of the Invest Southwest Target communities. CSX will be putting an additional 27 million into this community, creating both construction jobs and permanent employment, increased jobs. While there is no city money going into this project, which is another bonus, notwithstanding that CSX voluntarily is committed to meeting 26% of minority contracts in the construction and 6% of WBE contracts in the construction.

Again, we've worked very closely with Alderman Coleman's office. She has been wonderfully supportive and helpful.

[Speaker 1] (1:07:42 - 1:07:50)
I'm gonna ask the Alderman to speak on this fabulous project with her AKA bracelet she has on today. I'm sure you have something to do with the language.

[Speaker 3] (1:07:52 - 1:07:55)
I've said too much, so I'll stop.

[Speaker 1] (1:07:56 - 1:07:56)
Alderman Coleman.

[Speaker 43] (1:07:58 - 1:08:48)
Thank you, Chairman Toney. I didn't realize that was in the camera. I just wanna thank you and your staff and everyone in this committee for helping a freshman alderman navigate this very long process.

And although COVID happened, we are still moving right along as Mr. Livingston and Mr. Harris mentioned a $27 million development right at 64th and Western that will bridge the gap and provide opportunities pre and post construction. And that's what we're most excited about in addition to expanding the intermodel in the 16th war over in West Englewood that Alderman Lopez and I share. So thank you, Chairman Toney.

Thank you, CSX. And thank you to my colleagues. And let's get this on moving.

[Speaker 1] (1:08:49 - 1:08:57)
All right. I appreciate that. We have two hands raised and they are your neighbors.

We'll start with Alderman Ray Lopez. Raymond.

[Speaker 21] (1:08:58 - 1:09:54)
Thank you, Chairman. And good morning committee. I want to first off congratulate our colleague Alderman Coleman, my neighbor, my older neighbor and buddy on this fabulous project.

CSX has been a wonderful partner in our ward. As they have in the 16th ward and I believe the 17th ward also truly an anchor on our side of town, creating jobs and opportunity in the area that separates Chicago Lawn and West Englewood. And those are the kinds of good paying blue collar manufacturing type jobs, industry jobs that we need in our neighborhoods.

And to see that we are not only preserving, but expanding is not an opportunity that any of us should think lightly of. And we should fully support it moving forward. So I look forward to voting for it today and voting for it fully tomorrow.

Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:09:55 - 1:09:57)
Thank you, Alderman. Alderman David Moore.

[Speaker 25] (1:10:00 - 1:11:53)
Thank you, Chairman. Definitely commend my colleague Alderman Stephanie Coleman for working on this project as it impacts many of us as we're dealing with not only that project, but the whole CREATE project that's impacting all of our boards that it's gonna be a benefit to the community. I know, I didn't see Tom Livingston.

I must've came on late, was doing something if he was speaking. But Tom has been a great asset to us in the community in terms of keeping us informed and communicating. And I know the other gentleman, I'm sorry, I didn't see your name said, meet the 26 and six, but I know that is the floor and definitely not the ceiling.

And so I know Tom Livingston himself through his works have been already working with different organizations in the community to prepare people as we should be doing throughout the city when projects come, making sure they are prepared to work before even the work starts. So I wanna thank Tom and his team for that. And I'm sure I have no doubt that they're doing this on this site as well.

I just put out as we continue to build here, we wanna make sure we continue to keep our tracks cleaned. And I know other railroads on those, but CSX has been a partner and when we're calling them and it's something that's impacted by them, they're getting those railroads clean, but we wanna make sure that their other partners are doing the same thing as we do this development here. So again, just command Alderman Stephanie Coleman, who I no doubt is gonna hold them to even doing more than the 26 and six in terms of the hiring.

So I am definitely in support of this project. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:11:53 - 1:12:03)
Thank you, Alderman. I don't see any other hands up with questions or comments. Can I get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine?

[Speaker 21] (1:12:04 - 1:12:05)
So moved by Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 1] (1:12:05 - 1:12:55)
Alderman Raymond Lopez moves to pass. Any objections to that motion? Hearing none, the item is passed as revised.

Congratulations, Alderman Coleman and look forward to continuing to work with you and our committee for projects in your ward. All right, bottom of page two, document number 20559, T1, first ward. Ordinance was referred on November 16th of 2020, common address, 1701 West Division Street.

The change request B33 Community Shopping District to B32 Community Shopping District. Let's see, Tim Barton, I believe, is going to be the attorney on this. Tim.

[Speaker 24] (1:13:02 - 1:13:03)
How's that?

[Speaker 1] (1:13:04 - 1:13:05)
Tim Barton, I hear you.

[Speaker 24] (1:13:06 - 1:15:10)
Okay, good morning. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. For the record, my name is Tim Barton.

I am the attorney, an attorney in the law office of Tom Raines. Here today, representing John Kelly, the owner of the property and the applicant for this rezoning. Just to be clear at the outset, this is a voluntary down zoning.

The property was rezoned to its current B3-3 zoning designation as a type one amendment in 2017. The applicant is now seeking to amend that zoning and to replace the plans that were approved with it. The original scope of the project called for the renovation of an existing building and the construction of a five story, eight unit rear addition to it.

This work required the increase in the FAR and a change in the base zoning from B3-2 to B3-3, the current zoning. The architectural plans for that renovation and the new construction were approved as part of that type one zoning, rezoning. The scope of the work now though has changed and is limited only to the renovation of the existing building.

Since work on projects can only proceed with plans approved with the rezoning amendment, the original type one ordinance for this property has to now be updated. Therefore, only the B3-2 zoning will be necessary and it will only be according to renovation plans. There won't be any new construction.

I'm happy to answer any of your questions. Alderman LaSpada is aware of this map amendment. He is in support of it.

[Speaker 1] (1:15:12 - 1:15:33)
We do have a lot of support from Alderman LaSpada. All right, questions, comments, committee members. Tim, I have one quick comment.

Since it is a down zoning, interestingly enough from a B3-3 type one, is it the same applicant?

[Speaker 24] (1:15:34 - 1:15:42)
Yes, yes. So the scope of the project just changed.

[Speaker 1] (1:15:42 - 1:15:43)
Yeah, okay.

[Speaker 24] (1:15:43 - 1:15:44)
But he was the original applicant.

[Speaker 1] (1:15:45 - 1:15:56)
Okay, thank you. I have no more questions, comments. Can I get a motion?

I'd move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

[Speaker 25] (1:15:58 - 1:15:59)
So moved by Alderman David Moore.

[Speaker 1] (1:16:00 - 1:16:07)
Alderman David Moore moves do pass. Any objections to that motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

[Speaker 52] (1:16:08 - 1:16:08)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:16:10 - 1:16:42)
Now we're on the top of page, middle of page three. Document number 20546, 41st Ward. Ordinance was referred on November 16th of 2020.

Common address 5366 through 5370 West Devon Avenue. And 6401 North Central Avenue. This change request is a B1-1 Neighborhood Shopping District to a B3-1 Community Shopping District.

Mark Kupiec.

[Speaker 23] (1:16:44 - 1:18:59)
Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My name is Mark Kupiec. I'm an attorney with offices at 77 West Washington.

I represent the applicant. Subject properties at the corner of Devine and Central in the downtown Edgebrook neighborhood. The zoning change we're asking for is from a B1-1 to a B3-1.

Many of the properties across the street and across the alley are already zoned B3. So actually the zoning would be very compatible. The zoning change would be very compatible with other zoning districts up and down Devine Avenue.

Looking to establish a liquor store with the retail sales of packaged liquors. I would note this is the plan is an upscale liquor store featuring select wines and craft beers. The applicant currently operates a similar liquor store on Lincoln Avenue, which was very successful, very popular and looking to expand into this Edgebrook neighborhood.

It's an existing building and a vacant store, formerly a mattress store, which has actually been vacant for some time. There's been a extensive community process in connection with this application. Alderman Napolitano has a ward advisory committee and he's had two meetings.

And this case has been before them on two separate occasions, well-attended virtual meetings. And the plan has been explained and the committee has voted to support it. I believe the Alderman has also taken an online survey where the vast majority of the people have in fact supported this application.

And the applicant has separately gone to the Chamber of Commerce and solicited their support along with a couple other neighborhood organizations. Not only is this mattress store been gone for some time, but more recently during the pandemic, there was a Starbucks across the street that closed down and has announced that it will not be reopening. So the neighbors actually were anxious to see this particular site develop.

So with that, I believe you have a letter from Alderman Napolitano and I would ask for your support.

[Speaker 1] (1:18:59 - 1:19:04)
Okay, we do have a letter of support from Alderman Napolitano. Questions by committee members?

[Speaker 21] (1:19:06 - 1:19:08)
We do pass Chairman, Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 1] (1:19:08 - 1:19:24)
All right, Alderman Ray Lopez moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Now we'll be in the bottom of page three. Mark, are you still there?

[Speaker 23] (1:19:24 - 1:19:25)
Still here, yes.

[Speaker 1] (1:19:25 - 1:19:31)
Okay, I'm gonna read this into the record, but I understand we're gonna take a motion to defer this item, is that correct?

[Speaker 23] (1:19:32 - 1:19:33)
That is correct, yes.

[Speaker 1] (1:19:33 - 1:20:05)
Okay, so document number 20421, 14th Ward. Ordinance was referred on June 17th of 2020. The common address 3330 through 3356 West 51st Street.

The change request, M12 Limited Manufacturing Business Park District to M22 Light Industry District. Hearing that the item is being deferred by the applicant, can I get a motion to defer this previously read item?

[Speaker 29] (1:20:05 - 1:20:06)
So moved, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:20:07 - 1:20:12)
That is Alderman Ravoyos moves to defer this item. All those in favor?

[Speaker 29] (1:20:12 - 1:20:13)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (1:20:13 - 1:20:19)
Any opposed? Hearing no objections, this item has been deferred.

[Speaker 52] (1:20:20 - 1:20:20)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:20:21 - 1:20:58)
Top of page four. Item number 2055, I'm sorry, 20552 T1, 25th Ward. Ordinance was referred on November 16th of 2020.

Change request, or I'm sorry, common address 1744 West 21st Place. And the change request, RT4 Residential Two Flat Townhouse and Multi-Unit District to a B23 Neighborhood Mixed Use District. Let's see, our attorney is Ximena Castro.

[Speaker 8] (1:20:59 - 1:21:01)
Hi, how is everyone? Good morning.

[Speaker 1] (1:21:01 - 1:21:05)
Good. Let's hear from you on 21st Place.

[Speaker 8] (1:21:06 - 1:22:40)
Yes. So my name is Ximena Castro. I'm the Zoning Attorney at Acosta Outskirt.

I'll be representing the matter at 1744 West 21st Place. The property is located on the north side of West 21st Place between Paulina Street to the east and Wood Street to the west. It is a 3,125 square foot lot.

Improved with a two and a half story existing residential building that includes four dwelling units and a detached two car garage. It is currently zoned RT4. We are proposing to zone it to a B23, which B23 is seen in the area actually on the same block as well.

And we're rezoning it to add two dwelling units to the basement for a total of six dwelling units on the property. And everything will remain the same in the building in terms of no additions added. We will be demolishing the garage and we will be doing a three car surface parking lot in the rear.

And we have a letter of support from the alderman. We did meet with the alderman and his committee in November. And we will also be committing to with the alderman's office since this is a six unit building.

It's not quite crossing the threshold of a required ARO, but we will be committing to record a covenant against the property to provide one affordable unit in accordance to the average medium income of 60% under the ARO.

[Speaker 1] (1:22:40 - 1:22:58)
All right. Thank you, Jimena. I know we have a letter of support from Alderman Sicho-Lopez, but I saw him on the call.

Alderman Sicho-Lopez, would you like to comment on the 21st place application, sir?

[Speaker 47] (1:22:59 - 1:23:26)
Yeah, no, thank you, chairman. I just want to commend the applicant, as they said, even though they are not required to provide any affordability under the current ARO. Since it's under 10 units, but I want to commend them for working with us to provide an affordable housing unit that is, you know, especially now during these times.

So I want to commend them to working with us and the community. And we're supportive of this project. Thank you, chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:23:26 - 1:23:37)
Thank you, alderman. Questions for the applicant or the alderman? Hearing none.

Can I get a motion to move to pass by the- So moved. To determine quorum.

[Speaker 25] (1:23:38 - 1:23:39)
So moved by Alderman David Moore.

[Speaker 1] (1:23:40 - 1:24:15)
Alderman David Moore moves to pass. Any objections to that motion? Hearing none, the item's passed.

Now we're on the bottom of page four, document number 20558-T1. 25th ward ordinance was referred on November 16th of 2020. Common address, 2238 West 24th Street.

Change request. RS3 residential single-use detached house district to B23 neighborhood mixed-use district. We also have Jimena Castro on this.

[Speaker 8] (1:24:16 - 1:25:40)
Yes, once more for the record. My name is Jimena Castro. I'm the zoning attorney at Acosta-Ezgar.

Here representing the applicant. As the chairman said for the property at 2238 West 24th Street. This case is similar as the last case.

It's located on the north side of West 24th Street between Lovett to the east and Oakley to the west. Again, it is a two and a half story residential building with four dwelling units and a two car surface parking lot in the rear. It is currently zoned RS3.

We are zoning it to B23 like in the last case. And we will be adding two dwelling units for a total of six dwelling units. Two of the dwelling units will be in the basement.

And we will be adding a third story dormer to increase the size of the units. And we will be getting a variation to reduce setbacks and also variation to reduce any additional required parking. We did meet with the Alderman and Alderman's office for their ZAB meeting.

We do have a lot of our supports. And like in the last case, this is a six dwelling unit building, but we are committed to providing affordable units in the 25th Ward. And the applicant will be recording a covenant against the property to provide a affordable unit, 60% AMI under the AR road.

[Speaker 1] (1:25:40 - 1:25:47)
Thank you. Thank you for that. Alderman Sitio Lopez, you want to comment on 24th Street?

[Speaker 47] (1:25:48 - 1:26:04)
Yeah, no, similar situation. So again, I know that it's taken us a minute to make sure that we create a covenant. And I want to, again, appreciate the collaboration of the applicant to work with us on this project.

Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 29] (1:26:05 - 1:26:05)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:26:07 - 1:26:21)
Okay. Just one question for the Alderman, actually on both of them or for Jimena. What is the, what are the park, what you said about parking?

So talk to me, what is the parking on the 24th Street? How many parking spaces?

[Speaker 8] (1:26:21 - 1:26:35)
So currently it's a two, it's a, there's a two surface parking lot. There's two parking lots, parking spaces in the rear, surface parking. And we will be adding another parking space.

[Speaker 1] (1:26:36 - 1:26:45)
Anything that's- So there's three, right, three for six. And then on the, I'm sorry, on the one on 21st, is that the same setup or what?

[Speaker 8] (1:26:45 - 1:26:59)
The one on the 21st Street, there's a two car garage. We will be demolishing it and doing three surface parking lot for three spaces. 0.5. Again, and then, you know, getting a variation for anything else that's required.

[Speaker 1] (1:27:00 - 1:27:07)
Okay. Thank you. Questions, comments from, let's see.

We have Alderman Ray Lopez with a question. Raymond.

[Speaker 21] (1:27:07 - 1:27:22)
Thank you, Chairman. I just have one quick question. When it comes to community covenants, like the one that our colleague has achieved with the developer, are those also incorporated in the ordinance or who?

No. Are those managed with by DPD?

[Speaker 1] (1:27:23 - 1:27:30)
Those are not even managed by DPD. It's a private covenant between, in this case- The best faith effort? Or in the Alderman, I believe.

[Speaker 21] (1:27:30 - 1:27:31)
Okay.

[Speaker 8] (1:27:31 - 1:27:33)
It's recorded against the property.

[Speaker 21] (1:27:36 - 1:27:37)
Got it. Okay. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:27:38 - 1:27:44)
All right. City is not part of that transaction though, even though it's recorded on the deed.

[Speaker 21] (1:27:47 - 1:27:59)
The reason I asked was if there was some sort of kind of uniformity when it comes to these covenants. I know we hear them often in various projects. So maybe that's something that we can look at some point down the road.

[Speaker 1] (1:28:00 - 1:28:01)
Thank you.

[Speaker 21] (1:28:01 - 1:28:01)
Move to pass, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:28:02 - 1:28:58)
Okay. So I don't see any other hands up. Alderman Ray Lopez moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections to that motion? Hearing none, the item is passed. Thank you very much.

Now we're on the top of page five. Thank you. Thank you.

Have a good day. Item number 20538, 26th Ward. Ordinance was referred to on November 16th of 2020.

Common address, 2156 North Kimball Avenue. And the change request, RS3 residential single unit detached house district to a B11 neighborhood shopping district. We have Dean Maragas.

Dean? Did we see Dean on the call?

[Speaker 51] (1:29:01 - 1:29:03)
He is here, Chairman. One sec.

[Speaker 38] (1:29:16 - 1:29:17)
All right.

[Speaker 51] (1:29:22 - 1:29:27)
Actually, Chairman, he might've slipped off when I promoted to panelists. So if you wanna move on, we'll get him back.

[Speaker 1] (1:29:27 - 1:29:59)
Okay. Thank you, Bennett. We're gonna hold on that item in the 26th Ward on Kimball, but we're gonna stay in the 26th Ward.

Document number 20560. The ordinance was referred on November 16th of 2020. This common address, 2740 West Chicago Avenue.

The change request, C12 neighborhood commercial district to a B23 neighborhood mixed use district. And we have John Fritchie. John?

[Speaker 39] (1:29:59 - 1:30:01)
Chairman, good to see you at least virtually.

[Speaker 1] (1:30:02 - 1:30:03)
Yeah, nice to see you, John.

[Speaker 39] (1:30:04 - 1:30:58)
Happy to be here before the committee. As you stated, this is a rezoning for the property located at 2740 West Chicago Avenue. The rezoning sought is from a C12 neighborhood commercial district to a B23 neighborhood mixed use district.

The zoning changes sought for use only. This is an existing four-story building that presently has vacant ground floor commercial space that the owners have tried to make a good faith effort to lease for about two years now. In an attempt then to provide additional housing stock and to eliminate the vacant storefront, we've worked with Alderman Maldonado, who has been very helpful and reached an agreement that with this rezoning, the property will be set up for lease for residential use only, not for work live or anything else.

We know of no objection to this. I believe that the Alderman has submitted a letter to the committee. I spoke with him as recently as this morning and we are set to go, assuming we have the blessing of the committee.

[Speaker 1] (1:30:59 - 1:31:11)
Thank you, John. We do have an email received this morning in support from Alderman Maldonado's office. Do we have questions by committee members?

Can I get a motion to pass?

[Speaker 29] (1:31:11 - 1:31:12)
So moved, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:31:12 - 1:31:23)
That was used to determine quorum. That was Alderman Roboyes. Moves do pass.

Objections to that motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

[Speaker 39] (1:31:23 - 1:31:29)
Thank you, Chairman, members of the committee. I hope everybody has a good holiday and please stay safe. Thank you, John.

You too.

[Speaker 1] (1:31:30 - 1:32:02)
All right. I believe we're now moving to the top of page six. Item number 20539, 36th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on November 16th of 2020. Common address is 2618 North Oak Park Avenue. Change request.

RS2, residential single unit detached house district to an RS3, residential unit detached house district. We have Andrea Daron.

[Speaker 36] (1:32:02 - 1:33:11)
Correct. Good morning. Andrea Daron on behalf of the owner, Keyman Real Estate LLC.

This is a request to rezone from RS2 to RS3 for the property located at 2618 North Oak Park. This property is currently in an RS2 zoning area, but it is surrounded by RS3 to the south and to the west. Additionally, there is another property located on the same block, just one block north that has been zoned RS3.

The purpose of the rezoning is to build new construction. It will still be a single family home within the guidelines of RS3. The plan that my client had obtained are just a little bit outside of the RS2 zoning with regards to the footprint on the lot line, which is why we're requesting the rezoning.

It will continue to be a single family home with a detached garage.

[Speaker 1] (1:33:18 - 1:33:24)
All right. So Alderman Gill, is Gil Villegas on the call?

[Speaker 45] (1:33:25 - 1:33:26)
Yes, sir, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:33:27 - 1:33:35)
Okay. So this is the Oak Park Avenue item. I think you're in support, are you?

[Speaker 24] (1:33:35 - 1:33:37)
Yes. Yes, I am, Chairman. I am in support of this.

[Speaker 1] (1:33:38 - 1:33:53)
Okay. All right. Well, we got an email to that effect that we just talked.

And any questions from committee members? Hearing no questions, comments, can I get a motion? Move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine.

[Speaker 21] (1:33:54 - 1:33:55)
Alderman Cardona, do pass.

[Speaker 1] (1:33:55 - 1:34:03)
Alderman Cardona moves to pass on the item. Any objections to that motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

[Speaker 36] (1:34:04 - 1:34:05)
Thank you, committee members.

[Speaker 1] (1:34:05 - 1:34:40)
Happy holidays. Okay. We're going to stay in the 36th ward.

Item number 20556, ordinance was referred on November 16th of 2020. The common address is 2052 North Laramie Avenue. The change request, RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district.

We have, I'm not going to, I got to wait for his photo. Nick, or Daniel Box. Last time I.

[Speaker 7] (1:34:41 - 1:34:42)
Nick today.

[Speaker 1] (1:34:43 - 1:34:51)
All right. You surprised me last time, Nick. So let's move.

Let's move to the Laramie application, please.

[Speaker 7] (1:34:52 - 1:35:46)
Okay. Thank you again for the record. Nick from the law offices of Sam Banks.

I'm here on behalf of the applicant and property owner, Mr. Sergio Torres. The existing property at 2052 North Laramie is about 4,700 square feet in size. It's improved with a two-unit residential building.

The owner is proposing a zoning change from RS3 to RT4 in order to permit an additional dwelling unit. So an increase from two units to three units. The owner had actually worked directly with Alderman Villegas prior to coming to our office.

My office then reconnected with the Alderman and secured a letter of support, which I believe was already sent over to the committee. There's no other change to the building except for the build out of the basement as a garden level unit. No expansion other than that.

[Speaker 1] (1:35:47 - 1:35:52)
We have a letter of support from Alderman Villegas. Gil, do you want to say a few words on this one?

[Speaker 44] (1:35:52 - 1:35:55)
No, sir. It's very simple. Okay.

Zoning change. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:35:56 - 1:36:01)
Thank you, Alderman. Nick, just from my question, what are the parking spaces here on this one?

[Speaker 7] (1:36:02 - 1:36:14)
It's actually a wide lot. So we're actually able to provide the additional parking space, even though it's not technically required per code. Practically speaking, there will be three parking spaces at the rear of the lot.

[Speaker 1] (1:36:14 - 1:36:17)
Thank you, Nick. Questions for the Alderman or the applicant?

[Speaker 26] (1:36:18 - 1:36:20)
Move to pass, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:36:20 - 1:37:52)
Hearing none. I have Alderman Pat Dowell that moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that motion?

Hearing none, the item is passed. Thank you, Nick. We'll stay with Nick on item number 20550-T1, 46th Ward.

The ordinance was referred on November 16th of 2020. Common address 4511 through 4523 North Clark Street. The change request is a C12 neighborhood commercial district to a B33 community shopping district.

We have Nick here. But before we bring Nick on, just to remind our committee members, we had eight public speakers in the public comment period that were opposed to this project. Most of them, I believe, lived on the adjacent neighbor residential street of Dover.

There was more than one opposition, but some neighboring owners on Clark Street also. In addition to that, we had 18 letters of post that were emailed to our office, including a petition. And my committee members have already received it.

Why don't you proceed on this project on Clark Street? Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 7] (1:37:52 - 1:40:08)
Again, for the record, Nick Fitikas from the Law Offices of Sam Banks. I'm here on behalf of the applicant and property owner, 4511 Clark Acquisitions, LLC. The applicant is proposing to redevelop the subject property that contains about 16,858 square feet of total lot area with a new five-story mixed-use building.

The proposed building would contain about 3,400 square feet of grade-level retail space and a total of 56 residential units. The subject property is within the transit-oriented development range of the Ravenswood Metro Stop, the Montrose CTA, and the Wilson CTA. And based on that, we're asking for a parking reduction from the 56 spaces to 28 spaces.

So it's a 50% parking reduction based on transit-oriented development. The proposed building, again, will be five stories in height, measuring 58 feet per zoning. We began the process, the community review process, with Alderman Kaplan's office about 18 months ago.

During the time, we've worked with the Uptown United Development Partners, the Clark Street Lot Club, as well as the 46th Ward Development Council. And it's my understanding that all three of those groups issued letters of support for the program. We also, again, worked hand-in-hand with the Alderman's office and made a handful of changes to our program.

We also made commitments to some local existing business owners in the immediate area, specifically the Black Ensemble Theater. And we're offering part of our retail space at a significantly reduced rent to allow artists an opportunity to have that space along Clark Street. So although we know that there is some opposition to the program, there also is quite a bit of support that's been garnered over the last 18 months.

I believe Alderman Kaplan has issued a letter of support. I believe he's also on the line. And I will yield the floor to the Alderman from here.

[Speaker 26] (1:40:08 - 1:40:29)
Mr. Chairman? Yes, Alderman Dow. Can you, does the attorney have anything to share with us by screen, you know, pictures or to get a sense of the neighborhood context or anything other than the verbal description?

[Speaker 7] (1:40:31 - 1:40:50)
Chairman, my, again, Nick Fatikas, for the record. Our project architect, Mr. Horneff, is signed in and on the call. He may be able, if he's promoted, he may be able to share the screen to at least give renderings and maybe the slides of the plans.

All right.

[Speaker 26] (1:40:51 - 1:41:03)
And then if the Alderman could point out the, because I don't have a context of visual, I'm not sure what the issues are with the constituent.

[Speaker 1] (1:41:04 - 1:41:10)
All right. So, Bennett, are you on, are we promoting the architect here on this one?

[Speaker 11] (1:41:10 - 1:41:12)
Yeah, I don't know if you can hear me.

[Speaker 1] (1:41:14 - 1:41:17)
Would you identify yourself if that's the architect?

[Speaker 11] (1:41:17 - 1:41:23)
Yes, this is William Oden Horneff. I'm with 2RZ. We're the architect for this project.

[Speaker 1] (1:41:23 - 1:41:28)
Okay. Do you have any of the plans to be able to share with committee members?

[Speaker 11] (1:41:28 - 1:41:31)
I do. I apologize. I'm going to take a minute to share.

[Speaker 26] (1:41:38 - 1:41:39)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:41:40 - 1:42:17)
Thank you, Alderman Dowell. All right. All right.

How about committee members? Are we all, can you see it on your screens?

[Speaker 28] (1:42:19 - 1:42:20)
Yes. Yes, we can.

[Speaker 1] (1:42:21 - 1:42:28)
Okay. Okay. Then let's start with what you want to present to the committee.

[Speaker 11] (1:42:31 - 1:43:02)
Let me get this set up. So this is 4511 North Clark. It's a five-story building with, as Nick had mentioned, there's retail along Clark.

It spans from 4511 to 4523. As Nick had mentioned, it's about 3,400 square feet.

[Speaker 1] (1:43:03 - 1:43:10)
I think your presentation has yet to link up to the committee yet. Got it. I'm sorry.

[Speaker 50] (1:43:12 - 1:43:21)
Mr. Horneff, if you can stop sharing and then share just the PDF. Let's say just the application and just share that PDF file.

[Speaker 11] (1:43:21 - 1:43:22)
Let me try that again.

[Speaker 21] (1:43:27 - 1:44:03)
Point of information, Chairman. Point of information, Alderman Ray Lopez. Thank you.

Chairman, I just have a quick question while we wait for this to load. You know, when we met in person, we would oftentimes have these on the PowerPoints and things of that nature. Are applicants still providing the committee with these documents and things of that nature?

Since we've been doing this via Zoom. So I think it would be easier if it was presented either with the agenda or managed by the committee staff on the day of.

[Speaker 1] (1:44:04 - 1:44:29)
The schematics were not sent to the committee. When they're not sent to the committee, unless we are in a situation like we're on today, you know, we're not requiring it. But I know most of our plan commission items generally have some schematic that was presented at plan commission and are readily available to the committee members upon asking.

[Speaker 21] (1:44:30 - 1:44:33)
But is that something that could be handled internally?

[Speaker 1] (1:44:33 - 1:45:09)
Or well, we recommend that, you know, even like when we were in the chamber, we recommend, you know, to visual aids, a visual like we're asking for now. And I think we probably should check off the boxes on some of these larger ones. And especially if we've got by resident groups or, you know, this one looked like it was going to be contentious.

So we probably for the benefit of the committee should have had these in advance. But we will bet Nicole's writing this stuff down.

[Speaker 21] (1:45:09 - 1:45:10)
Thank you, Nicole.

[Speaker 1] (1:45:12 - 1:45:20)
It's cracking the whip, I think, as we move forward. All right. So William.

Thank you.

[Speaker 11] (1:45:20 - 1:45:22)
Can everyone see this now?

[Speaker 1] (1:45:23 - 1:45:24)
I think we can. Yes.

[Speaker 11] (1:45:25 - 1:48:01)
Okay, thank you. So as I had mentioned, it's a five-story building. There's retail at the first floor, of course, and four stories of residential above.

There's about 3,400 square feet of retail spanning from, for the most part, from 4511 to 4523. The residential entry is on the north corner of our lot. So as I just mentioned, it spans from 4511 to 4523.

The building itself is set back both on the front and the rear. The rear setback meets the 30 feet requirement at the residential level. And then the front, as you can see, has a series of bays of units that move in and out.

But on average, or I should say at minimum, they're eight feet back off the lot line. Typical floor plans for the apartments. This is the retail level and then the apartments themselves.

There are 56 units, a mix of two bedrooms, one bedroom, and some studios. So from a floor plan standpoint, the retail, again, is off of Clark. Residential entry is to the north.

Parking, there are 28 parking spaces that are accessed off the alley. And then loading is also off the alley. And then this would be a typical layout of the units.

Like I said, there's a mix of one bedrooms, two bedrooms, and studios. For our floor plans, there is a small habitable roof deck. The Clark elevation.

So a series of balconies and decks. This is something that through the community process that was asked for, that we provide more outdoor space. So because the building is set back at the second floor on both sides of the building, there are terraces for the apartments on the west face.

And then the 30-foot sit-back on the east face. The section itself of the building. So Clark is here.

The alley is here, of course. So that's sort of a nutshell of the building itself. I'm happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (1:48:02 - 1:48:10)
Right. So I'm going to go back to Alderman Dowell. I know you asked a question about context with the block.

Alderman, do you want to?

[Speaker 26] (1:48:11 - 1:48:40)
Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm just trying to understand the context.

And then I did a Google search of the address. And everything in that block is one story, basically. Or maybe two.

Is this the character of that strip generally beyond this block? Or is the block sort of, the strip sort of mixed in height?

[Speaker 11] (1:48:42 - 1:49:13)
Well, if you look at the address, you're absolutely right. The buildings that we would be replacing are one-story buildings. But the buildings to the north and the south have much more height to them.

A block down, there are several four- and five-story buildings. And then across the way, there are a couple of story buildings. And then right next to us is a two-story building.

And then two doors down is a three- or four-story building.

[Speaker 26] (1:49:16 - 1:49:39)
Okay, Mr. Chairman. Just trying to get a sense of the surroundings. I appreciate you taking the time to show this.

And if the concerns of the residents could be described again. Just so, now that I'm seeing the building, what were their concerns?

[Speaker 1] (1:49:40 - 1:51:07)
Well, I can speak for some of the complaints. We did get a lot of complaints from the residents on doors abutted from the alley sign. The scale of the building was not consistent in their minds with the corridor.

And I think in a lot of ways, they felt that particular block club did not feel they were part of the process. I think more so once COVID hit. But I think those are the issues.

The scale, the density, the character. And the other question about the... I think there was a criticism about 28 parking spaces, I believe.

That in and out one entry, exit off the alley. I did note, my staff noted that the alley... One applicant talked about the sewage in his property.

We did an alley search. And I think that is a green alley. It's a relatively new alley for the abutting properties on Dover.

So with that, Alderman, can we get a couple more questions from committee members? Alderman Dowell, I'm gonna...

[Speaker 26] (1:51:07 - 1:51:10)
No, you've answered my question. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:51:10 - 1:51:13)
Okay, Alderman Osterman has his hand up.

[Speaker 16] (1:51:15 - 1:51:19)
Did Alderman Kappelman discuss this?

[Speaker 1] (1:51:19 - 1:51:24)
Testified. He hasn't testified yet. Would it be the benefit to the committee members?

[Speaker 16] (1:51:26 - 1:51:33)
Our colleagues would at least like to hear the Alderman's vision for this stretch. And then I got a couple of questions.

[Speaker 1] (1:51:33 - 1:51:35)
All right, Alderman Kappelman.

[Speaker 2] (1:51:36 - 1:59:20)
Thank you, Chair. Regarding the notification about the process used for this, notices about these meetings were in my newsletter, posted on Facebook, posted on Twitter, placed on my ward website and on various neighborhood blogs. Over the years, I've visited with every business along Clark Street and I've encouraged them to sign up for my newsletter.

And they were all given my private cell phone number. So when it comes to obtaining notices about ward matters, I can only encourage them to please read my weekly newsletters. Regarding this fear that this one upzone would cause an avalanche of upzones along Clark, I hear that fear a lot, which might be one of the reasons why residents on Dover Street have consistently voted down every zoning request ever made along Clark and Wilson Avenues.

In the nine years I've been alderman. However, that has never occurred in other parts of the ward that received an upzone. In addition, the 46 Ward Zoning and Development Committee, which reviews all zoning requests for projects valued at over $10 million, they take each request separately.

I've never heard any zoning committee member state the need to upzone a property because another property on the block was also upzoned. From listening to residents on Dover, the major fear appeared to be focused on density. And I fully understand this concern because a six-story apartment building was constructed just east of my condo and neighbors in my 16-unit condo building were pleasantly surprised that none of our fears about that development ever came true.

On Clark Street, there's a five-story building at 4420 North Clark. At 4421, there's a four-story. At 4650, there's a four-story.

At 4717, there's a four-story. 4733, four-story. 4747, four-story.

And on the 4800 block, there's a five-story building. I think there might be two. Regarding the request for support of an art district envisioned by Jackie Taylor of Black Ensemble Theater, the developer, just as Nick said, is meeting with Jackie Taylor on a regular basis and is working out the details for a live-in workspace within this development for an interested Black-owned business owner that will complement the incredible mission that Black Ensemble Theater has.

And it will be done in a manner that would not require any financial investment from them, which I believe makes it a win-win all the way around. Regarding Dover Street Neighbors' objection to this project in the formation of Clark Street Block Club, my concern is that Dover Street Neighbors' process never allowed residents on Clark Street to vote on zoning matters on their own street. There's an element of fairness that's missing here.

And even if Dover Street Neighbors allowed residents on Clark to have any say on matters on their own street, their bylaws allow one vote for each building. And given that there are no single-family homes on Clark and the exceptionally high number of single-family homes on Dover, residents on Clark would have to defer to single-family homeowners to make their decisions. So it's not surprising then that residents on Clark started their own block club in order to have some say about zoning matters on their own street.

This block club participates in activities with Sheridan Park Neighbors Association, the Uptown Chicago Commission, and the 46th Ward Zoning Development Committee. Nevertheless, it was the 46th Ward Zoning Development Committee, not the Clark Street Block Club that voted to support this development. Of the five block clubs located within Sheridan Park, three of them voted in support of this project.

Regarding a Clark Street petition signed by business owners, business owners stated they signed this petition to stop this project because they feared their rents would go up. Their rents are currently low because there is a record level of vacant storefronts and over half of the buildings along this four block strip have been placed on the market. That's a sign of a retail corridor in very serious trouble.

These businesses cannot afford to do without less foot traffic that's desperately needed for this corridor. More foot traffic can only help businesses as is the goal of any retail corridor study. Pressing a pause on this zoning change until a retail corridor study occurs will not change the fact that the Clark Street Retail Corridor has been heading in a rapid downward spiral for the past several years.

Long before COVID ever entered the picture. A few years ago, I joined with former Alderman Puar to request the use of TIF funds for this study and we continue to wait for this to occur, but I can't imagine any study suggesting less density and fewer people would help boost the economy along this retail corridor that's now on life supports. The 46 Ward Zoning Development Committee in a vote, they passed this in a vote of 15 to seven.

This is an overwhelming support. And in the end, the Zoning Committee's approval for this proposal was for the following reasons. Number one, it provided badly needed foot traffic to a retail corridor that was in desperate need of more customers.

Number two, they fully supported the need for a retail corridor study along Clark and also believe that such a study would strongly encourage more density and more foot traffic, which this development would provide. Number three, the developer's request for an up zone added only eight and a half feet to the height that was currently allowed by its current zoning. But that allows for a project that would add six units of affordable housing with many of them being two bedrooms, which is a far cry from the high number of micro units that have come into this area.

The Zoning Committee appreciated that the developer created a setback for the apartment units on the back of the project for the benefits of the residents on Dover. It's located in a transit served area that typically calls for higher density rather than less. The developer agreed at the meeting to work with Black Ensemble Theater to get a Black owned business into that retail space, which was also an incredible thing to have happen.

And they believe that the design was striking and complimented Black Ensemble Theater's design as well. So, I mean, with all that work that was done, I asked that my colleagues support the decision of the 46 Ward Zoning and Development Committee.

[Speaker 1] (1:59:20 - 1:59:23)
Thank you, Alderman. Alderman Osterman.

[Speaker 16] (1:59:24 - 2:01:13)
I appreciate the explanation. And I think the extensive inclusiveness that Alderman Kaplan puts into his zoning process and giving out a cell phone, that's quite something. Let me just say real quickly, I think about the stretch, because I think this stretch is between myself and Alderman Tunney's Ward, and I think we travel it frequently.

I think that there's a natural tension between residential communities with single family homes and commercial streets like Clark Street. And I think a lot of times there's fear of what can happen. I think I have Andersonville to the north and there's a coexistence of residential small two flats with a thriving business community.

The stretch where this residential development is going is one that as Alderman Kaplan just pointed out, I think has had a very difficult time with retail economic development going back for a couple of decades. I think a lot of the advancements that Alderman Kaplan has championed with public transportation, and I'll also say safety along Wilson Avenue and Clark Street has kind of moved the community in a positive direction. I think adding more residents in this area, I think is gonna help the overall foot traffic as he points out, which will help the businesses in the community, but also create some more housing options for this area.

So I appreciate the work that him and his committee have done. And I stand in support of this ordinance today. And I think once it's built, I think the neighbors will all coexist together.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:01:13 - 2:01:16)
Thank you, Alderman. Alderman Walter Burnett.

[Speaker 5] (2:01:17 - 2:01:26)
Yeah, Mr. Chairman, I'm sorry. I didn't hear all of the presentation when it was presented. Was there any affordable housing with this project?

[Speaker 1] (2:01:28 - 2:01:33)
The Alderman Kaplan said there's six units affordable in the project.

[Speaker 5] (2:01:34 - 2:01:35)
How many units is it?

[Speaker 1] (2:01:36 - 2:01:36)
58.

[Speaker 5] (2:01:37 - 2:01:38)
58?

[Speaker 1] (2:01:38 - 2:01:46)
50, no, I'm sorry, 56. 56. 56 units, 28 parking spaces.

[Speaker 2] (2:01:46 - 2:01:48)
I'm following the ARO to the letter of the law.

[Speaker 5] (2:01:49 - 2:04:38)
Okay, that's great. So, you know, around Thanksgiving, I had the opportunity to visit up in that area. I actually got a relative that live up there.

You know, this community is so diverse and there's so many people of need of affordable housing in that community. You know, it's like a whole nother world that folks that live on the west side and the south side could not imagine how the north side is. The north side is one of the most diverse communities ethnically and economically in the city of Chicago.

And they definitely need a diversity of housing in that community. And everyone lives together in that neighborhood and have been doing so for many years, right? But also at a time when we are losing population in the city tenfold and it's having an adverse effect on our economy.

For a small increase in densities like this, I don't believe, I can understand if it was a 20-story building or 30-story building, but this is not a very large change in the community. And we all as citizens need to recognize when we don't have density in our city, we all suffer, quite honestly. That means we have less people putting into the pot and it has an adverse effect on all of us.

I know folks tend to be somewhat selfish. They tend to care only about themselves, but sometimes we have to look beyond ourselves and think about the greater good of our society and our community. Because aggressively all of us need to start thinking about how do we get that critical mass in our society to sustain ourselves and be competitive with other cities across the country to be able to attract more dollars to our city.

I'm so frightened to see what our census numbers are gonna look at when they come in. And it will have an effect on our city when those numbers come in. But my feeling is the more people we have putting in the pot, the better it is for all of us to deal with all of the other resources that we need in our community.

So I commend Alderman Kapperman for taking a small step to increase, to contribute to the density challenges that we have in our city. And I commend his community for accepting it. Thank you.

Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (2:04:39 - 2:04:43)
I have one more hand up, I believe. Alderman Brian Hopkin.

[Speaker 48] (2:04:45 - 2:05:26)
Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm in support of this project and I'll be voting in favor. And I appreciate Alderman Kapperman outlining the notification efforts that he made.

I believe all of us go over and above the requirements in the Zoning Code and the Open Meetings Act to try and spread the word when there's an issue to be resolved by this committee. But anytime objections and complaints are raised about that, I think it's important to just put it on the record. So let me just ask Alderman Kapperman, were you in full compliance with all notification requirements and posting requirements by both the Open Meetings Act and the Zoning Code for this matter?

Yes. All right, no further questions. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:05:27 - 2:05:31)
I think Alderman Dowell might have another question or clarification.

[Speaker 26] (2:05:31 - 2:06:00)
No, I just, thank you, Mr. Chairman. No, I just wanted to also commend Alderman Kapperman for giving a really full explanation of the process. You know, I always say there's three sides to a story and it was really good to hear the full assessment that he's provided this morning.

And with that, Mr. Chairman, I would like to move to pass on this item.

[Speaker 1] (2:06:01 - 2:06:18)
All right, seeing no hands up, questions or comments, Alderman Pat Dowell moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that motion? Hearing no objection, the item is passed.

Thank you. Thank you all.

[Speaker 52] (2:06:18 - 2:06:19)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (2:06:21 - 2:06:56)
All right, moving on to page seven, document number 20544, 49th Ward. Ordinance was referred on November 16th of 2020. Address, common address 7630 through 7638 North Rogers Avenue.

Change request, residential business plan development number 977 to B35 Community Shopping District. We have Warren Silver. Warren, proceed on this item on Rogers Avenue, please.

[Speaker 34] (2:06:56 - 2:08:09)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. For the record, I'm Warren Silver, Silver Law Office PC and of counsel to Brown, Udell, Pomerantz and Delrahim Limited. We are here today representing the applicant Rogers Roman 1 LLC.

This parcel is currently subject to residential business plan development 977, which long ago expired, but was never removed under the process of 1713-0612E of the zoning ordinance. The applicant is now seeking to have that long ago lapsed plan development removed and to have the property revert back to its underlying zoning of B3-5. We reviewed the matter with Alderman Haddon's office and I think she's still on the call on the committee and by all means, if you want to speak to it, but we were advised that we have the support of her office.

[Speaker 1] (2:08:10 - 2:08:16)
Thank you, Warren. I know Alderman Haddon's on the call or on the Zoom. Alderman Haddon?

[Speaker 34] (2:08:21 - 2:08:24)
Maria? Looks like she's muted.

[Speaker 1] (2:08:32 - 2:08:42)
Must be. Do we have a letter of support from Alderman Haddon? Warren, did you get a letter of support from Alderman Haddon?

[Speaker 34] (2:08:43 - 2:08:46)
We did and- Okay, sorry.

[Speaker 1] (2:08:46 - 2:08:52)
Okay, Marie. Sorry, Chair. Alderman Haddon is on.

Maria?

[Speaker 37] (2:08:54 - 2:10:08)
Hello. Yes. Just wanted to, yeah.

Definitely in support of this move. I'll say this is really procedural. So right now, this was a fun research project.

I want to thank the Department of Planning and Development and Patrick Murphy's team for helping us to kind of unpack this, but this is really a correction. So the underlying zoning and this property, we're just returning it to the underlying zoning. There was a plan development there.

That never moved forward far, far longer ago than I was here. So we had community meetings about this, kind of weighing some of our options. We had the Department of Planning and Development actually present other options to us if we were going to go through the process of zoning change.

And after extensive community input, some of the expert input, and working with the property owner, we determined that this was the best route, just returning it to the underlying zoning. So I ask my colleagues for your support in this. Procedural matter that honestly should have been done ultimately by ordinance.

So thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:10:08 - 2:10:13)
Thank you. Thank you, Maria. Questions for the alder woman or the applicant?

[Speaker 25] (2:10:14 - 2:10:16)
No questions. So moved by Alderman David Moore.

[Speaker 1] (2:10:16 - 2:10:38)
No questions. I don't see any hands. Alderman David Moore moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections to that motion? Hearing none, the item's passed. Thank you very much.

Thank you. We're going back. I think we have Dean Maragos on the line.

[Speaker 46] (2:10:38 - 2:10:39)
How are you doing, Mr. Chairman?

[Speaker 1] (2:10:42 - 2:10:46)
Dean. Oh, Dean, your voice is a little lower this morning. What's going on, buddy?

[Speaker 46] (2:10:47 - 2:10:49)
I didn't make it to the choir practice.

[Speaker 1] (2:10:50 - 2:11:17)
Okay. So we will now go to page five, at the top of page five, document number 20538, 26th Ward. Ordinance was referred on November 16th of 2020.

This common address, 2156 North Kimball Avenue. Change request. RS3 residential single unit detached house district to a B11 neighborhood shopping district.

Okay. Dean Maragos.

[Speaker 46] (2:11:18 - 2:11:57)
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. Dean Maragos, I'm the attorney for the applicant. This purpose is to allow for the package good liquor sales as an accessory use to the existing retail food sales grocery store.

This grocery store has been in the neighborhood for many, many years. It's a small neighborhood grocery store that has been in the community for over 10 years. And we are seeking the zoning change to have a beer and wine only.

We've worked very closely with Alderman Maldonado and the community. And we have submitted to the committee, our letter of support from the Alderman. I will not take any questions on this matter.

[Speaker 1] (2:11:58 - 2:12:16)
Thank you, Dean. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Maldonado. Are there any questions for the attorney?

Okay. So no more questions, comments. Can I get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 25] (2:12:17 - 2:12:18)
So moved by Alderman David Moore.

[Speaker 1] (2:12:18 - 2:13:04)
Alderman David Moore moves do pass. Any objections to that motion? Okay, none.

The item is passed. Thank you, Dean. Thank you very much.

Okay. Back to the middle of page seven. Item number 20548, 11th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on November 16th, 2020. Common address 701 West 37th Street. Also 3700 to 3702 South Union Avenue.

The change request. RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district. David Medea is the attorney.

[Speaker 38] (2:13:05 - 2:13:06)
Oh, am I on?

[Speaker 1] (2:13:07 - 2:13:08)
Yes, you are, David.

[Speaker 38] (2:13:09 - 2:13:13)
Good morning, committee. Good morning. Hello, my name is David.

[Speaker 1] (2:13:13 - 2:13:14)
Good afternoon to you too.

[Speaker 38] (2:13:14 - 2:13:17)
Oh, well, I've been on since 10.

[Speaker 1] (2:13:17 - 2:13:18)
Yeah. Thanks.

[Speaker 38] (2:13:19 - 2:14:11)
I'd like to thank the committee for its time. My name is David Medea. I'm looking to have the property at 701 West 37th Street or 3700 to 3702 South Union Street rezoned from R3 to RT4 to construct two new single family homes with garages.

The current site, there's a building built on two lots. It's been probably vacant for over 25 years. And I have the Alderman conducted a community meeting and everybody was for it.

I think the Alderman has submitted a letter to you with his approval of it. I'm sorry, I can't hear anything.

[Speaker 1] (2:14:11 - 2:14:17)
We have received his letter of support from Alderman Thompson. Did you hear me?

[Speaker 38] (2:14:18 - 2:14:19)
Yes, I can.

[Speaker 1] (2:14:20 - 2:14:25)
Okay, so we did get a letter of support from Alderman Thompson. Are you finished with your presentation?

[Speaker 38] (2:14:25 - 2:14:26)
Yes, I am.

[Speaker 1] (2:14:26 - 2:14:32)
Okay, so let's ask some questions. We have Alderman Burnett on this item. Walter?

[Speaker 5] (2:14:33 - 2:14:46)
Yeah, thanks, Mr. Chairman. Just wanted to ask, it looked like you said that you're taking a lot with two properties on it and you're gonna make a single family home out of it?

[Speaker 2] (2:14:47 - 2:14:48)
Oh, no, no, two. The other way around.

[Speaker 5] (2:14:51 - 2:14:54)
You're gonna take two properties and make a two flat?

[Speaker 38] (2:14:56 - 2:15:07)
No, no, right now it's a building built on two lots. It's a two-story building built on two lots. We're gonna tear the building down and build two brand new two-story single family homes.

[Speaker 5] (2:15:07 - 2:15:12)
Oh, you're building two homes. Okay, all right, I got it. All right, fantastic.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:15:13 - 2:15:14)
Alderman Ravoyos.

[Speaker 29] (2:15:15 - 2:15:21)
Mr. Chairman, I see Dave Medea on that side. Just wanted to say hello to him and good to see that he's still working.

[Speaker 1] (2:15:22 - 2:15:46)
Yes, Alderman. All righty, I don't have any more hands up, questions, comments with that. Does Alderman Ravoyos make the motion to- So move.

Yes, by the same roll call that was used to determine form and that he does. Any objections to Alderman Ravoyos' motion? Hearing none, the item's passed.

Thank you, David.

[Speaker 38] (2:15:47 - 2:15:48)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:15:49 - 2:16:19)
Bottom of page seven, document number 20557-T1-T4. Ordinance was referred on November 16th of 2020. This common address, 2501-2511 West 103rd Street.

Change request. RS2, residential single unit detached house district to a C11 neighborhood commercial district. We have John Brand on this one.

John.

[Speaker 32] (2:16:19 - 2:17:46)
Yes, good afternoon. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Excuse me.

My name is John Brand and I am the owner of the property located at 2501 through 11 West 103rd Street. I'm also a resident and a small business owner in the Beverly Morgan Park neighborhood in the 19th Ward. As you stated, I am respectfully seeking to change the zoning on the property from an RS2 residential single unit district to a C1-1 neighborhood commercial district for the purposes of converting an existing vacant two-story building into a multi-unit modern tech wired office building.

A C1-1 designation is required to meet the use standards to establish the office use within the existing two-story building and with existing onsite parking. The conversion project includes enhancements to the exterior landscaping and we think will materially improve the aesthetics of this particular stretch of 103rd, which is just west of Western Avenue. The project and the plans have been shared with and supported by Alderman Matthew O'Shea.

And we've also shared the plans and received support from the residents surrounding the property. I'd also like to mention that we've submitted a substitute narrative and plan. And that mention is at the request of Department of Planning and Development staff.

With that, I'd be happy to answer any questions of the committee.

[Speaker 1] (2:17:46 - 2:18:20)
Move to accept the substitute narrative. Look at you, look at you. That is, so Alderman Roboius moves to accept the substantive narrative plans one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Who could have called Alderman Roboius, right? So, all right.

Hearing no objections, the substantive narrative plans are accepted. Is that the extent of your testimony, Mr. Brand? Yes, sir.

Okay. Can we hear from Alderman Matt O'Shea on this one?

[Speaker 42] (2:18:21 - 2:18:30)
Thank you, Chairman. I'd like to point out that Ariel was probably the kid that sat in the first seat raising his hand. I've got the answer, teacher.

[Speaker 1] (2:18:33 - 2:18:40)
I'm not sure he was that astute in the first row, you know, knowing his career in the 44th Ward. I sat in the closet.

[Speaker 42] (2:18:42 - 2:19:30)
All right, continue Matt. Chairman, yes, I am in full support of this change in zoning. Mr. Brand has had a very successful career in my community of investing money. And turning blighted areas into positive areas in the community. This was originally a Ridge Lutheran church built in 1946. About 20 years ago, it became an alternative private school and has sat vacant for the last several years.

A real eyesore in the West Beverly community. Mr. Brand led a group purchasing the property and this is an exciting project that I think will be a big boon to the 19th Ward community. And I stand in support.

Thanks, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:19:31 - 2:19:45)
Thank you, Alderman. Any questions for the Alderman, the applicant? All right, so I need a motion to accept.

Well- Alderman Cardona, do pass. The substantive narrative and plans.

[Speaker 29] (2:19:46 - 2:19:47)
Don't move, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:19:48 - 2:20:07)
Okay, so Alderman Raboyas to pass with the substantive narrative and plans. Any objections to that? Hearing none, it's passed with the substantive narrative and plans.

Good luck, Mr. Brand. Sounds like an exciting project.

[Speaker 32] (2:20:08 - 2:20:09)
Thank you. Thanks, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:20:10 - 2:20:40)
Okay, top of page eight. Document number 20551-T1, 34th Ward. Ordinance was referred on November 16th, 2020.

Common address, 955 West 115th Street. And the change request. M11 Limited Manufacturing Business Park District to an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district.

We have Jason Brown on this application. Jason, are you with us? There you are.

Okay.

[Speaker 30] (2:20:41 - 2:21:44)
I'm here, Chairman. Thank you. And thank you to the committee members.

I'm the construction manager for Habitat for Humanity Chicago. And I am here with Jen Parks, who's our executive director. We are requesting to rezone the property known as 955 West 115th Street from M11 to RT4.

It is a vacant former industrial site that we would like to develop into a 22-unit development with townhomes and detached garages. The entire development will be affordable housing. We will cap the income of our homebuyers at 80% of AMI.

And as I said, there'll be off-street parking in covered garages for each of the units. There's mixed zoning on the corridor that this building is on now. But there is a lot of residential in the area, and there is RT4 just down the block.

And we have also received a letter of support from Alderman Austin of the 34th Ward. And I will take any questions anybody might have.

[Speaker 1] (2:21:44 - 2:21:53)
We have a letter of support from Alderman Kerry Austin. Questions by committee members? Comments?

Walter Burnett.

[Speaker 5] (2:21:54 - 2:22:17)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to commend Alderman Austin and the developer for being progressive that far south, making things to continue to happen and keeping affordable housing on the foreground. So thank you all very much, and compliments to Alderman Austin.

Congratulations. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:22:18 - 2:22:42)
Thank you. Thank you, Alderman. Any other questions?

So let me just say congratulations to Alderman Austin, but, not but, but Jason. So this Habitat is the applicant, correct? Yes, Habitat for Humanity Chicago.

And I would say there would be somewhat layers of financing involved with this project too?

[Speaker 30] (2:22:44 - 2:23:03)
Yeah, there are. We have a non-traditional financing model. We do a lot of fundraising through our corporate partnerships.

And, you know, we get gift and kind services provided. Jen is on the call, can get into more of our financing model.

[Speaker 1] (2:23:04 - 2:23:12)
But we have a- No, no, this is a zoning meeting. Just, I just- Yeah, we have a strong history- We all look for creative ways to bring affordability to our community.

[Speaker 30] (2:23:12 - 2:23:26)
Yeah, we have a strong history of development in West Pullman. We've successfully constructed on the order of 30 units a few blocks south of this development. We've been in the community for years and we plan to be there for quite some time.

[Speaker 1] (2:23:27 - 2:23:39)
Great, all right. Any other questions, comments? Hearing none, do I have a motion to move do pass for the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 52] (2:23:40 - 2:23:41)
Second.

[Speaker 1] (2:23:41 - 2:23:56)
That was Alderman Burnett. I believe moves do pass. Any objections?

Hearing none, the item is passed. Congratulations to you and the team and the alder woman.

[Speaker 16] (2:23:57 - 2:23:57)
All right. Thank you all.

[Speaker 1] (2:23:58 - 2:24:24)
Middle of page eight, document number 20549, 50th Ward. Ordinance was referred on November 16th of 2020. Common address 2640 to 2644 West Pratt Boulevard.

Change request, B11 neighborhood shopping district to an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district. I think this would be Yosef Kalman.

[Speaker 19] (2:24:28 - 2:26:46)
Yeah, that's correct. Thank you for having me today, this afternoon. My name is Yosef Kalman.

I am both the owner, co-owner of Signature Acquisitions. The owner of the building, as well as the architect of record for the project. We are seeking to rezone the property from B1-1 to an RT4 zone property.

In order to allow us to comply with the bulk and density standards to establish conversion of this, of what is currently a multi-use residential building. It's a five-unit building with three existing commercial spaces on the first floor and two existing residential units on the second floor. And with this rezoning, we will be, we are looking to be allowed to convert the first floor units into residential.

So the whole building will be residential. We're not increasing the size of the building. We're going to be adding some parking spaces in the back to accommodate the zone, the parking requirements for that.

This is a building that's on a predominantly residentially zoned street. Both on this side of our side of the block, as well as across the street. Over 75% of the properties are single family and small two-flat buildings.

This building has, the commercial spaces have essentially stayed more or less vacant for many years before we acquired it. And the building has gone into disrepair. And our goal is to invest quite a bit into enhancing the building, the overall aesthetic of the front, as well as clean up the back.

And together with the conversion of the first floor units, we hope that that'll help enhance the overall neighborhood. Myself and my partner both grew up in this neighborhood. So we've seen this building many years struggle to keep tenants.

And so our goal is to convert it into a building that will be stabilized through that conversion. Well, I believe that is...

[Speaker 1] (2:26:47 - 2:26:54)
Mr. Kelman, have you worked with Alderman Silverstein on this project? Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 19] (2:26:54 - 2:27:24)
So we had a meeting on September 22nd with Alderman as... Well, we spoke numerous times, but that we had as well a neighborhood meeting with her. And the outcome of that meeting was very positive.

I personally did not receive the letter of recommendation, but she verbally recommend was in approval of this during the meeting. I don't know if she sent it to you guys. But during the meeting was positive.

[Speaker 1] (2:27:24 - 2:27:59)
Right. We have not received her letter of support. She is not on the call, but I'm going to ask for questions from committee members or comments.

What I will do, I've made outreach to her personally. If it's the will of the committee, we'll pass it at committee and hold it until we do get her affirmation before the council meeting, hopefully tomorrow. Committee members, does that sound like a plan or any questions for the applicant?

[Speaker 5] (2:28:03 - 2:28:05)
Good plan. I'm good with it.

[Speaker 1] (2:28:06 - 2:28:45)
Okay. Okay. So Alderman Walter Burnett moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections with that caveat that I said to the committee? Any objections? Hearing no objections, the item is passed.

Again, we will hold that until we hear and affirm the positive support from Alderman Silverstein. Okay. We need to go back.

We're going to go back to page one, I believe.

[Speaker 44] (2:28:47 - 2:28:49)
So that's it, but now we're going to make sure.

[Speaker 1] (2:28:50 - 2:29:21)
We have Alderman LaSpada on his aldermanic application. I'm going to read it again into the record on page one. Item number A8605, first ward ordinance was referred on September 9th of 2020.

Common address, 2948 through 54 West Armitage Avenue. Also 2001 through 2011 North Humboldt Boulevard. Change request, C13 neighborhood commercial district to C12 neighborhood commercial district.

Alderman LaSpada.

[Speaker 22] (2:29:23 - 2:31:03)
Thank you, chairman. To give some background on this, we spoke about this briefly a couple weeks ago, but this is a zoning amendment for the lot currently improved with parsons. It's a really great fried chicken restaurant in our ward.

The previous upzoning was sought nearly a decade ago solely to eliminate a parking requirement for the restaurant. During that process, so we moved from C1-2 up to C1-3. This is about moving the zoning back down.

So during that process, the business promised to the community to return the zoning back to its previous district. This zoning amendment returns the zoning to its previous district and completes that promise. So we know downzoning can always be a tenuous process to move forward.

Why we really did our homework on this. Talked to multiple community members, talked to the business, were able to get testimony for many different stakeholders. We wanted to make sure that this automatic introduction was clearly representative of commitments made by the business to the community that it was grounded in community interests.

But I will add to you all is very much a rational downzone. It's very much in line with the broader pattern of zoning you would see along Armitage Avenue. This all being said, I do hope we have favorable consideration by the committee.

And I'm also available to answer any questions you may have.

[Speaker 1] (2:31:03 - 2:31:31)
All right. Thank you, Alderman. We have questions for the Alderman.

I have one quick question because it was brought up in an earlier application about a covenant on a particular project. Was there a covenant established at all with the property owner with the community groups to rezone this back to its original C-1-2?

[Speaker 22] (2:31:33 - 2:31:37)
In terms of specifically like a legal restricted covenant?

[Speaker 1] (2:31:37 - 2:32:28)
Yeah. I mean, Alderman Lopez talked about private covenants. And they're only enforceable, you know, not through the city, obviously.

But somewhere there was a document that said, hey, we were going to once we get our licenses, we would rezone the property back. I had my own issues with the rooftops in Lakeview. You know, to get them their licenses for the rooftops.

And then we had to go back and downzone. Some did, some didn't. So I had to go back myself and to make sure that they were all downzoned back to the R-T-4.

So that's just a case in point in 44. But do you have, I know you've obviously testified that you were not the Alderman at the time. But you do have plenty of backup on the community.

But no covenant?

[Speaker 22] (2:32:29 - 2:33:03)
Not a specific legal restricted covenant in that sense. But we do have written confirmation from the owner of Parsons, who was the owner still when the restaurant was getting started. We have testimony from more than a dozen folks who were in those zoning meetings at the time.

All of whom have actually agreed, if it were to come to that, that they would sign legal affidavits based off of their commitments and what they heard in those meetings. So everything short of a restricted covenant.

[Speaker 1] (2:33:03 - 2:33:13)
Great. All righty. I wouldn't have brought it up if it wasn't brought up by one of our colleagues just this morning on another project.

All right. So can I get a motion to move?

[Speaker 29] (2:33:13 - 2:33:15)
Move on this matter, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:33:15 - 2:34:01)
All righty. Thank God I am a vice chair as robust as Alderman Raboia. So Alderman Raboia's moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine form.

Any objections to that motion? Objection. The item is passed.

Thank you, Chairman. We're going to page eight. Back to page eight.

I should say bottom of. But we're looking for Louis Powell. We don't have him signed in unless it's under a different name.

Is that correct, Bennett? We don't have him?

[Speaker 51] (2:34:02 - 2:34:03)
That is accurate, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:34:05 - 2:34:43)
All right. Then we're going to hold on this one too. So let's try to find Louis so we can get this done today.

All right. Top of page nine. Number 20463, 24th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on July 22nd of 2020. Address 2100 South Pulaski Road. Change request.

B3-2 Community Shopping District to a B2-3 Neighborhood Mixed Use District. We have Richard Zulke. Richard.

[Speaker 45] (2:34:44 - 2:35:33)
Good morning. Good afternoon to you, sir. Yes, sir.

Richard Zulke representing the Mejerado family. This is case number 20463. This is a petition to change the present zoning from B3-2 to B2-3.

On the side, there was a two-story building, masonry constructed building. We seek to legalize a pre-existing first floor residential apartment and continue the existing commercial unit with three dwelling units above. The property is over 100 years old.

It is emphasized that the purpose of this is to maintain an existing use of the property. We've discussed this with the alderman. The alderman had certain concerns that we think he is now satisfied with.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:35:33 - 2:36:02)
All right, Richard. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Michael Scott. Any questions from committee members or comments?

Hearing none, I have a motion from Alderman Walter Burnett by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Thank you, Richard.

[Speaker 45] (2:36:03 - 2:36:05)
Merry Christmas. Happy New Year to all. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:36:06 - 2:36:40)
Thank you. Same to you. Bottom of page nine, document number 20516, 32nd Ward.

Ordinance was referred on October 7th of 2020. Common address, 1653 through 1739 West Webster Avenue, and 2075 through 2189 North Elston Avenue. The change request, residential business plan development number 1420 to residential business plan development number 1420 as amended.

Chris Leach.

[Speaker 9] (2:36:41 - 2:37:51)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee on Zoning Landmarks and Building Standards. My name is Chris Leach, and I'm an attorney with Ackerman LLP with Law Offices located at 71 South Wacker Drive. I'm appearing this afternoon on behalf of the applicant, Triangle Square Condominium LLC, in connection with the technical amendment to residential business plan development 1420.

The subject property is located in the 32nd Ward within subarea C of residential business plan development number 1420, and bears a common address, 1653-1725 West Webster Avenue. Before presenting the details for the proposed technical amendment, I would like to inform the Committee that this application received the unanimous recommendation of the Chicago Plan Commission at its meeting held on November 19th, 2020. And I would respectfully request that the report of proceedings before the Plan Commission, together with all reports and documents previously transmitted to the Department of Planning and Development, be incorporated into and made a part of the record of this proceeding.

[Speaker 1] (2:37:52 - 2:38:07)
So Alderman Raboios moves to incorporate the records from the Plan Commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. So moved. Any objections?

Hearing none, the records are incorporated. Continue on. Thank you very much.

[Speaker 9] (2:38:07 - 2:40:13)
On September 20th, 2018, the Chicago City Council approved PD 1420 for the applicant to construct in subarea C, a seven-story residential building with a height of 98 feet, containing 66 dwelling units and 66 on-site parking spaces. In May of this year, the applicant added an additional three units to the PD administratively and shifted two units from subarea A to subarea C for 71 units to be constructed in subarea C. The applicant is now before you asking to add one additional unit to subarea C to construct a total of 72 dwelling units and 72 on-site parking spaces for subarea C.

No other changes to the PD are being sought by the applicant, except for adding this one additional unit. The cost of construction for the project is approximately $28.5 million and will create 160 temporary construction jobs and three permanent jobs. The applicant is committed to achieving the MBE-WBE participation of 26 and 6 in the 50% goals for the local hiring in the city.

And the PD 1420 is also in compliance with the Affordable Housing Ordinance with providing nine units on-site in subarea A and paying in a payment in the amount of $3,597,132 has been made to the Affordable Housing Opportunity Fund. We believe the proposed amendment to the plan development meets the standards of the Chicago Zoning Ordinance and we would request your favorable recommendation. On behalf of the applicant, I would like to thank Alderman Wagespacht who has received this proposed amendment and has provided us with a letter of no objection to the proposed amendment.

And also we would like to thank the staff of DPD for their hard work on the project and particularly Emily Throne. Stand ready to answer any questions that the committee may have. Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (2:40:14 - 2:40:19)
Thank you, Chris. I see Alderman Wagespacht on the call. Alderman.

[Speaker 49] (2:40:20 - 2:40:55)
Thanks, Chairman. I do not have an objection to this change. We did go through this at the plan commission as was noted.

I think you were there with me for that long meeting. There are some other infrastructure issues there in the vicinity. This building's right nearby the metro station at Clybourne and Ashland.

So we did review and it seemed that it was consistent with the project as originally proposed. So I just asked for the support of the committee on this agenda item. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:40:56 - 2:41:12)
Thank you, Alderman. Questions for the Alderman of the applicant? Hearing none, can I get a motion moved to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

Alderman Cardona, do pass. Alderman Cardona moves to pass. Any objections to his motion?

[Speaker 29] (2:41:13 - 2:41:13)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (2:41:15 - 2:41:20)
Hearing none, this item will be passed as revised. Thank you.

[Speaker 9] (2:41:20 - 2:41:22)
Thank you very much. Happy holidays to everyone.

[Speaker 1] (2:41:23 - 2:42:14)
Thank you, sir. And then quickly, we're going to go middle of page eight. I skipped over a deferral that I need to write or speak into the record on.

That being number 20439, 27th Ward, ordinance was referred on July 22nd of 2020. Common addresses, 1939 through 1959 West Lake Street, 115 through 159 North Damon, 1900 through 1958 West Maypole, 1901 through 1959 West Maypole, 1900 through 1948 West Washington, and 100 through 146 North Walcott. That hasn't been the planned admission.

Okay. So I need a motion to defer this item.

[Speaker 21] (2:42:15 - 2:42:17)
So moved, Chairman. Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 1] (2:42:17 - 2:42:27)
Alderman, any other, any questions? Hearing none, Alderman Ray Lopez makes a motion to defer the previously read item. All in favor?

[Speaker 52] (2:42:28 - 2:42:28)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (2:42:28 - 2:43:08)
Aye. Any opposed? Hearing no objections, the item has been deferred.

All right. Top of page 10, number 20533, T1, 47th Ward. Ordinance was referred on October 7th of 2020.

Common address, 3333 through 3335 North Lincoln Avenue, and 3336 through 3338 North Marshfield Avenue. Change request, B12 Neighborhood Shopping District to a B13 Neighborhood Shopping District. Patrick Turner.

[Speaker 27] (2:43:09 - 2:44:09)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My name is Patrick Turner with offices at 33 North LaSalle Street. I represent Chicago 3333 Lincoln LLC, the owner of the subject property.

The property is a through lot extending from Lincoln to Marshfield. The applicant is seeking to rezone the property from its existing B1-2 classification to a B1-3 classification in order to erect a side three-story addition and a rear three-story addition to the existing three-story multi-use building. The zoning is sought to allow an increase in the maximum floor area ratio for the proposed addition, as well as to reduce the minimum off-street parking ratio by 100% as a transit-served location, the property being in close proximity to the Paulina Brown line stop.

Hold on a second.

[Speaker 1] (2:44:09 - 2:44:15)
I think the document that was presented is not your project.

[Speaker 27] (2:44:16 - 2:44:23)
I'm sorry. I was concentrating on my presentation. I wasn't paying attention to the exhibit that was on the screen.

[Speaker 1] (2:44:25 - 2:44:42)
All right. Let's make sure we get the technical. Okay.

Yeah, let's keep going on it and then we'll see if the slide comes up. Patrick.

[Speaker 27] (2:44:43 - 2:45:15)
Okay. We worked with the West Lakeview Neighbors and the Lakeview Chamber of Commerce, as well as Alderman Martin's office, and revised the project and the plans to address their concerns. Alderman Martin has submitted a letter of support to the committee.

The matter was originally scheduled for hearing on December 1st, but due to a few minor changes to the plans, the matter was continued to today so staff could review the changes. I am here available to answer any questions the committee may have.

[Speaker 1] (2:45:16 - 2:45:20)
Thank you, Patrick. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Martin.

[Speaker 8] (2:45:22 - 2:45:29)
I think we made the presentation the last time and it was cut short.

[Speaker 1] (2:45:30 - 2:45:53)
All right. Unless there's committee member questions or a desire, I'm going to leave it open for questions and comments on this application in 47. Okay.

I don't have any hands raised on that. Can I get a motion? Move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

[Speaker 52] (2:45:53 - 2:45:54)
I'll move.

[Speaker 1] (2:45:55 - 2:46:03)
That is Alderman Raboias moves to pass on the motion. Any objections to that? Hearing none.

The item is passed.

[Speaker 27] (2:46:04 - 2:46:07)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Members of the committee. Happy holidays to everybody.

[Speaker 1] (2:46:07 - 2:46:13)
Thank you, sir. Now we're, we're skipping.

[Speaker 29] (2:46:18 - 2:46:19)
44th Ward.

[Speaker 1] (2:46:19 - 2:46:30)
Okay. Okay, Vice Chair Raboias, this item you want to read it into the record bottom of page 10 in the 44th Ward.

[Speaker 29] (2:46:30 - 2:47:07)
Yes, Mr. Chairman. This is a number 20488T1 in the 44th Ward. Ordinance was referred to 992020 common address 835 West Edison Street.

The change request is an RM-5 residential multi-unit district to a B1-3 neighborhood shopping district. Mr. Chairman, it's important to note that this item went before the planning commission at this time. Alderman Lopez moves to incorporate the records from the planning commission by the same roll call used to determine form.

[Speaker 1] (2:47:07 - 2:47:18)
Any objections? Wait, wait, wait, wait. Before, I think, Ariel, we gave you a little bit of the wrong directive.

This was, this was not before the planning commission.

[Speaker 29] (2:47:18 - 2:47:19)
Was not.

[Speaker 1] (2:47:19 - 2:47:26)
We have a substantive narrative plan, change of plans for the T1. So there was some.

[Speaker 21] (2:47:26 - 2:47:29)
And I, then I move to accept the substantive plan and narrative.

[Speaker 29] (2:47:30 - 2:47:44)
Thank you, Alderman Lopez. You're welcome. Any objections?

Hearing none, it's up to the planner before us. We have with us, I think, speaking on this matter, is it Liz Butler?

[Speaker 6] (2:47:45 - 2:51:49)
Yes. Thank you, Mr. Vice Chair and members of the committee. My name is Liz Butler from the law firm of DLA Piper located at 444 West Lake Street in Chicago.

I, along with my colleague, Rich Clowder, represent the Lakeview Lutheran Church, the applicant in this matter. The church is seeking a zoning map amendment for the property located at 835 West Addison. There are substitute ordinance narrative and plans.

And thank you for accepting those for consideration. I'm joined today by Reverend Lila Bukema on behalf of the Lakeview Lutheran Church, Eric Huffman on behalf of Over the Rainbow Association, the church's development partner, and Dennis Langley of Weiss Langley Weiss, the project architect. Again, the applicant is seeking a type one zoning map amendment to rezone the property from the RM5 residential multi-unit district to the B13 neighborhood shopping district in order to construct a six-story multi-unit mixed-use building containing, which you see on your screen now, containing 37 dwelling units, ground floor religious assembly space, and 12 vehicular parking spaces.

The church has operated in Chicago for nearly 172 years and has been a neighborhood institution at this location in the Lakeview neighborhood since 1960. The church is partnering with the Over the Rainbow Association, an Illinois not-for-profit organization dedicated to providing barrier-free independent living solutions for individuals with physical disabilities. The property today is improved with the church's building, a single-story building, and together the church and the Over the Rainbow Association are proposing to redevelop the property with a mixed-use building that will provide permanent supportive housing for low-income individuals with physical disabilities.

Again, the project will provide 37 units of affordable housing on floors two through six, space for the church functions on the first floor and the second floor, and then 12 vehicular parking spaces on the ground floor within the building envelope. The church will continue to operate in the new building in a space that is right-sized for a smaller congregation. The property is a transit-served location.

It's located near the Addison L stop, and the project will utilize the transit-served features of the zoning ordinance to allow the proposed parking and project density. The project will redevelop the property with a development program that's designed to meet a critical shortage of affordable housing for low-income individuals with disabilities. The project will serve residents at or below 30% of AMI.

This project was vetted with Alderman Tunney and the community through a rigorous community review process. The applicant presented the project to the Triangle Neighbors Community Association in September and then again in November and to the 44th Ward Community Directed Development Council in September, along with smaller individual meetings that were hosted by Alderman Tunney and the development team with neighbors of the property. And as a result of the feedback that the development team received through that community process, the development team made a variety of design enhancements to make the project design more compatible and responsive to the neighborhood context, and a considerably superior project is the result.

A number of community partners have expressed their fervent support of the project and have provided letters to that effect. Again, we worked very closely with Alderman Tunney and his staff, and we understand that the alderman is in support of this application. And we would respectfully request that you recommend city council approval for this application.

We appreciate your time and your consideration of this project and we're available to answer any questions that you may have. Thank you.

[Speaker 29] (2:51:49 - 2:51:52)
Thank you, Ms. Butler. Chairman Tunney, would you like to speak on the matter?

[Speaker 1] (2:51:53 - 2:53:28)
Thank you, Vice Chairman Roboyas and members of the committee. This is a reuse of an existing church where the church will take a smaller footprint and the total number of units will be 100% affordable. The only thing to note that it's on the corner of Addison and Rita, Rita residential.

We're moving all the loading and unloading for activity on Addison at the request of the neighboring residences. And then also there is a 30 foot setback from the neighboring residential. I think there are four story buildings that are behind.

So there was concern about the overall height. I push it as much to Addison as we can. And we did have, as Liz said, you know, numerous meetings.

As she noted, I think we've got five letters for community groups. So we went through the process. I think we got a good project and a much sorely needed reuse of an existing church that will stay and 100% affordability on these units in Lakeview, which is a feat in of itself.

So I ask for the committee's support on this project. And for those of you that know where Rita is right across the street is the 19th police district station. So they didn't object to this.

[Speaker 29] (2:53:30 - 2:53:39)
All right. Thank you. Thank you, Chairman Tunney.

So the church will still be operating out of there as I take it, right? It used to be one of my hangouts in 1967.

[Speaker 1] (2:53:42 - 2:53:45)
I thought you were selling cars or in the parking lot there.

[Speaker 29] (2:53:45 - 2:53:47)
No, I used to live down the street from there.

[Speaker 1] (2:53:47 - 2:53:48)
No, all right.

[Speaker 29] (2:53:48 - 2:53:54)
If there are no questions, Alderman Lopez makes a motion do pass by the same road question.

[Speaker 16] (2:53:54 - 2:54:18)
Quick question. I know you were reliving glory days in 1967 when I was born. I was going to ask who picked the color blue, but I know that the Cubs are right up the street.

But a serious question, Alderman Tunney, in the financing of the project, is that done by the church or is there government funds that are going to it?

[Speaker 1] (2:54:20 - 2:54:30)
I think the applicant speak, but there are no city funds at this point. There's some state funding on this. Liz, did I misspeak?

[Speaker 6] (2:54:31 - 2:54:43)
Yeah, I can address that. The applicant will be submitting an application to IDA in January for low income housing tax credits. And then we'll be seeking some CHA support.

[Speaker 16] (2:54:44 - 2:55:15)
Okay. I think if through the committee chair, you could provide some of that background information. I think many of us are struggling with churches that are not being used to the full capacity even prior to COVID.

And I think in the need for affordable, accessible housing, this could be an option for using of old buildings that are otherwise being underutilized. So I think if we can get some of that information to committee members, we would welcome it. Good project.

Thank you.

[Speaker 5] (2:55:16 - 2:55:54)
Thank you, Alderman. Any other questions? Yeah, Mr. Chairman, I just want to, Alderman Burnett, I just want to commend my colleague, Alderman Tom Tunney, for contributing to our affordable housing challenges in the city. God bless the church for coming up with something creative to continue to help people. I think this is great. But also contributing to the bulk of the city because we do need more bodies in the city and diversity.

So congratulations to you all and God bless you, Mayor. Thank you, sir. All right.

Any other questions?

[Speaker 21] (2:55:54 - 2:55:58)
Chairman, I would renew the motion to approve as amended.

[Speaker 29] (2:55:59 - 2:56:14)
There are no questions. Alderman Lopez makes a motion do pass as substituted by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, the item is passed as revised. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:56:14 - 2:56:15)
Thank you.

[Speaker 29] (2:56:15 - 2:56:16)
Thank you, Liz.

[Speaker 1] (2:56:17 - 2:56:55)
All right. Okay, so we're, we're, my staff's telling me we're, we're right near the end. We have to defer one item.

But I also wanted to let you know that we did receive a positive email from Alderman Silverstein on the application on Pratt Boulevard in the 50th Ward. So with that, we're going to go back for the final item to defer. And I'll read it into the record.

It's on page eight. Unless Louis Powell is with us. He communicated with us to defer to January.

[Speaker 36] (2:56:55 - 2:56:55)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:56:56 - 2:57:35)
So he's asked to defer it. So let me read it into the record. Number 20525 3rd Ward.

Ordinance was referred on October 7th of 2020. Common address 3924 South Wells Street. Change request.

RT4 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district to a B21 neighborhood mixed use district. As was mentioned, the applicant wants to be deferred to the January meeting. Um, do I have any questions by committee members on that, uh, deferral motion?

Is that Alderman Ray Lopez on that?

[Speaker 21] (2:57:36 - 2:57:37)
Me and my dog. Yes, sir.

[Speaker 1] (2:57:38 - 2:57:51)
All right. I couldn't tell the distinction actually there. All right.

Alderman, uh, Ray Lopez and his dog makes a motion to defer the previously read item. All those in favor. Aye.

[Speaker 52] (2:57:51 - 2:57:51)
Aye. Aye.

[Speaker 1] (2:57:53 - 2:58:06)
I was going to barf, but I thought I'd leave it alone there. So, uh, any opposed hearing none, the, uh, the, uh, item has been deferred to the January meeting. So I think we're going to recess.

Is that correct?

[Speaker 18] (2:58:06 - 2:58:09)
Well, we're not recessing.

[Speaker 1] (2:58:09 - 2:58:17)
Okay. So we, the morning session of the zoning meeting, um, is, is adjourned or can I get a motion to adjourn?

[Speaker 48] (2:58:17 - 2:58:19)
Alderman Hopkins moves adjournment.

[Speaker 1] (2:58:19 - 2:59:03)
Alderman Hopkins moves to adjourn. All those in favor. Aye.

Aye. Aye. Any opposed hearing on the morning meeting is adjourned alderman or chairman Osterman and I, uh, will be on in about five to seven minutes on the two o'clock.

Oh, on the two o'clock. I'm sorry. My staff was on Eastern time this morning.

We had a, we had a dilemma here. So, uh, that being said, we'll see you in one hour and we will be discussing and hopefully voting on the ADU accessory dwelling unit ordinance one item on the agenda. Okay.

So see you in an hour. Have a good lunch. Thanks for this morning.
