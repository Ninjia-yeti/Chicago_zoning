And you, you are speaking on the item 755 East Oakwood, which is on our agenda right.

[Speaker 17] (13:56 - 13:57)
Okay, great.

[Speaker 1] (13:58 - 13:59)
Mr. Mr Pratt.

[Speaker 17] (13:59 - 16:53)
Yeah. Hi, good morning everybody. I'm here to speak in favor of the change recommended for the addresses of 757 to 773 East Oakwood Boulevard, specifically within this area.

757 East Oakwood is currently a commercial property it isn't a condo as the rest of it so the rest of the block. There are four condo buildings, each having three levels and three condos for row homes and a church. 757 was previously an abandoned or vacated beauty supply store.

And in the recent months, the tenants and or the owner of the property have tried to make it into a private event space. So what I was observed throughout this time is the facade of the building has been painted completely black on the front. The front doors are padlocked with two padlocks, and they are using the rear entrance to have people coming in and out of the building.

Also the front windows have a graded bars, the great security security rate so that you can't get in and out. And the glass has been completely covered with some type of a black curtain or black cardboard so that you can't see into the facility. They are having events there, up until 12am.

The neighbors have called the police department, and there's continually been questions about if this is a commercial property or a private property. In addition to the public safety concerns and this being a mostly a residential block with a park across the street is also the fire concern or the concern of having individuals having a public event or a private event. And there's only one way in and one way out because the front are completely padlocked with steel doors.

There's no name on the facility, there's no proper lighting to indicate that this would be a safe space. There have been meetings with the Alderman's office, and during that time there was a type of a business plan presented saying that it would also be used as a community space but there has been no signs that there are usages for community space. And the questions has continually been asked, are there any permits that have been pulled for this space for it to be used as a community center for event space, or anything of that nature.

I own the property directly adjacent to it to the west, and the noise at night when they have the parties are keeping me up as well as the other neighbors who have called the police and have called the Alderman's office and had meetings about this. Therefore, I, and many of the other neighbors are in favor of having this rezone to be a residential facility and no longer a commercial use facility.

[Speaker 1] (16:53 - 17:03)
Thank you, Mr. Pratt, our next speaker, Ronnie Reed, also on the Oakwood application Alderman application.

[Speaker 13] (17:05 - 20:10)
How's it going Hey my name is Ronnie Reed, I'm speaking on behalf of 757 East Oakwood Boulevard. My name is Ronnie I'm Chicago fireman me along with several other Chicago firemen, we decided to put a community art venue in this space. That's been the longest standing building in this community has been in this building in the community for over 30 years, the multiple business it was affected by COVID after COVID we up and running we get back up and running decide to come with a different business plan.

The properties adjacent to me was built in 2018, which as you see the zoning is be three dash to community shopping, which I don't understand how this property got approved to be built on this. Also on the other side, those are built in 2005, they're also residential, and this is the long we have the longest standing commercial building on this block is only six houses on the block across the from a public part. Also directly around the corner as multiple other businesses, but they are not affected by the zone and they specifically decided to change the zone and after we had a meeting with them about our proposed community art space from my building which not even the building he was speaking about, they directly did his own change from 757 to three properties down and they left the other businesses on cottage Grove, actually on cottage Grove, they didn't they didn't decide to change the zoning instead of changing it. It was directly in retaliation of us deciding to come down with the ultimate decide what like a business plan for we gave them a business plan they objected, we changed it we made it more community friendly, we made it open door policy. We also, and for to rebuttal on the previous comments about the doors and the private events, like I said I also Chicago firemen will never have one way in and one way out the, I be in there sometimes with several other friends and family, we in there also have a business license right now to operate have to be in place to operate in the space.

So, we're not open for business yet that's what this is the reason why we don't have any signs open because we're not open for business, even though we have business license. We're not up and set to be running for business and we still gathering everything together with the other fireship firemen on the ownership committee. Also, I would like to, I would like to speak on how the meetings that we were just discussing with several ultimate meetings with the ultimate multiple times how I had over, I had multiple supporters in the meeting, several times.

And once I was leaving the meeting, it was things being said about me and about the business and about the community me that I wasn't aware of when you know this is the longest like I said this is the longest standing business in the community, being here longer before either building on the side of me was built, even though it's only six properties is three on the right, three on the left, and it's a complete big a lot we're across the street from a public park. So, the park closes at 10 people from all side of neighborhood comes, it comes into community come to the park the park community friendly, we do events at the park for the community multiple times we have multiple nonprofit organization we work with with those spelling bees for the community, we don't we do givebacks Christmas givebacks toy drives, we have a bunch of firemen collected to put something good into the community, and we don't, we as objecting to the zone change for that one we're the longest standing business building in this community, and it's been commercial before any of these residential properties was built on this business on this residential land.

[Speaker 1] (20:10 - 20:31)
Well, thank you for your testimony, and I know we're, this is an aldermanic so we look forward to hearing what the alderman has to say about this, but for the record I just want you to conclude. You are the, you are, you have a license to operate a social club at this at this address, you just haven't opened it up yet or what.

[Speaker 13] (20:31 - 20:44)
Yeah, it's not a social club we actually doing a creative art space art venue for the community art gallery. But what is the license that you got. I have a limited business license, and I have a pop up host license and a pop up user license.

[Speaker 1] (20:45 - 21:01)
I'm sorry I heard the limited business I didn't hear the other two sir pop up user pop up host, oh pop up. Yeah. Okay.

Thank you for coming down today. Thank you. This should be early on the agenda we hope our alderman will be here, the minute, or a representative from her office.

So, stay tuned.

[Speaker 13] (21:01 - 21:01)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (21:01 - 21:08)
Next speaker Kathleen trainer. I believe.

[Speaker 39] (21:13 - 21:17)
Good morning. Morning. My name is Kathleen trainer.

[Speaker 16] (21:19 - 24:21)
I'm a resident of Lincoln Square, and I am a volunteer in Alderman Matt Martin's office focusing mostly on helping people with housing issues. I'm here today on behalf of a resident in Lincoln Square. Ruth Schilling, who wanted to come here herself today to offer her comments but what she was not able to make it, so I'm going to read her statement.

My name is Ruth Schilling. I am, excuse me, a 75 year old senior living solely on my modest social security check. I live in Lincoln Square for 31 years, and consider it my home.

Earlier this year I learned that my new landlord was planning to rehab the building, and I was told that I needed to leave by October 31. The other tenants were able to find places. But I was not.

I knew I needed to find subsidized housing it's all I could afford. I tried to figure it out on my own and just got very confused. I called Alderman Martin's office, and was put in touch with a very knowledgeable person who helped me.

I applied for six different buildings affordable buildings, trying to emphasize that I needed a place by the end of October. I learned that waiting lists were several years long, and my situation did not entitle me to any preference. It soon became apparent that I would need an interim subsidized place interim solution, we tried everything we could think of to find a place that I could stay while waiting for a subsidized place to become available.

Nothing we did brought any results. My maximum budget for rent is $900. I was dismayed and upset to learn that there are no longer any one bedroom or studio rents available in Lincoln Square for this amount.

I finally decided I had to leave Chicago and stay with family in Washington State. Frankly, I got so depressed, I knew I had to find a way to stay in Chicago. Finally, the landlord offered me a studio in another building he managed is in uptown.

With a lot of help from friends I managed to pack and move my apartment to a studio. This is temporary, I hope, until a subsidized place opens up for me. But I know my weight will be very long.

For nearly a year I have lived with the anxiety of housing insecurity, and it's still going on. It is abundantly clear to me that this is, there is a serious need for more affordable housing in Lincoln Square. I hope you will approve the project proposed for Lincoln Leland and Western, where 63 units of affordable housing will be built, if this project is approved.

It would be a much needed opportunity for me and others to stay in the neighborhood we call home.

[Speaker 1] (24:23 - 25:23)
Thank you for coming down today, and just for the benefit of the committee members, the item at Lincoln Square passed the plan commission, but it is almost the last item on our agenda. So, I know we have a couple more speakers on this. Okay.

Our next speaker, john Morrison. Again on this Leland and Lincoln project. Good morning.

[Speaker 10] (25:24 - 28:28)
Good morning. Thank you. I'm, as mentioned, my name is john Morrison.

I'm here today in support of the application 221122, the parcel that includes 4715 Northwestern Avenue. I have lived in and around the Lincoln Square area since 2007 have recently bought a home in the area. Doing so however was a challenge and I feel incredibly privileged, privileged to be able to afford to live in the area.

Unfortunately, not all of my neighbors are so privileged and it's only getting harder. I've had a front row seat and what as I've watched as multi unit buildings in our vibrant neighborhood of being increasingly torn down were deconverted into single family homes, making our community more expensive and more homogenous. When I saw the plans to redevelop the surface parking lot at 4715 Northwestern Northwestern Avenue.

It seemed like they were too good to be true, placing a large number of affordable units directly across the street from the CTA brown line station in the heart of a thriving neighborhood shopping district represents an incredible opportunity for our community, and exactly what we need in the best possible location. However, as soon as the plan was unveiled a hateful disinformation campaign rose up against it. It started with a website filled with falsehoods and a petition filled with pseudo anonymous racist remarks.

And after that mysterious signs and flyers popping up in our neighborhood with xenophobic rhetoric that have been that were put up overnight in public spaces. And it culminated with a local circular publishing a barrage of conspiratorial, quote unquote, articles loaded with bigoted dog whistles including one calling alderman Martin, quote unquote, the black gentry for many in our community. This has been a disgusting shock, and it's served to highlight how necessary this process this project truly is those voices do not represent Lincoln Square.

We know the Lincoln Square we know and love, and this vile rhetoric has has fueled many of us to advocate for this project independently. Over the past three years a grassroots coalition of neighborhood organizations, social justice organizations and businesses have coalesced around this project including indivisible Lincoln Square which I'm on the steering committee of one north side greater Rockwell organization. Heart of Lincoln Square Neighbors Association give me Lincoln Square, and the Lincoln Square Ravenswood Chamber of Commerce, including individually many of our businesses including Merza brought the Gary Cafe summary jeans sausage sausage shop and many many more.

Together we've spent countless hours, urging Alderman Martin the developer and the mayor to come together to make a compromise. We, I'm asking you today to not let a small group of vocal racist prevent affordable housing from being built in our community. Based on xenophobic reasons, this will add 63 affordable residential units ground floor retail public amenity space and it will, it will retain 36 parking spaces for the community and for the residents.

This is a great step for our future, and I thank you all for your time and your support for next speaker Alex Nelson.

[Speaker 32] (28:32 - 30:30)
Hi everyone, my name is Alex Nelson, I use she her pronouns and I'm one of the organizers of build housing now. I'm here to speak today on behalf of the application number 2112 to 4715 Northwestern Avenue. As mentioned, it is a 100% affordable development that is hopefully going to sit right in the heart of Lincoln Square, Lincoln Square already has the resources and amenities to support our new residents and our new neighbors.

We have robust access to public transit the development would be directly across the street from the Western Brown Line station. We have incredible schools we have grocery stores. And there's a small business district immediately nearby so the new residents will of course be a boon to the small business district and hopefully take part in our community.

As mentioned, we have the resources available to support our new neighbors. And I think that this would be a great sign that the north side is ready to change the narrative on affordable housing and who is welcome inside this part of the city. But this isn't just also me coming here in a sense of altruism.

This is also a public safety argument. Surface parking lots are dangerous places. They're dangerous for women, they're dangerous for children, they're just dangerous for pedestrians generally.

So replacing a surface parking lot with affordable housing is actually an act of public safety. Mixed income neighborhoods are safe neighborhoods, dense neighborhoods are safe neighborhoods. So this is a good news for the neighborhood.

This is an incredible use of space. And moreover, we think that the added density and our newest neighbors are going to be a really welcome and beneficial part of the community and we're excited that they're going to join us. So, again, we cannot wait for this development to come into our neighborhood.

We are ready and eager to welcome our new neighbors. And we hope 4715 Northwestern Avenue moves through the remainder of this process quickly and easily. Thank you for your time today.

[Speaker 1] (30:31 - 33:55)
Again, thank you for coming down and for the witnesses on this last item. It's going to be probably an hour and a half if you just conservatively given the length of our agenda. All right, that concludes the public speaking portion of the hearing.

We'll start off with the addendum to the agenda. We have no text amendments, no appointments, no landmark items. So we'll get right to the large signs over 100 square feet in area, 24 feet above grade.

We'll hear them all together. I'll read the ward followed by the address and take a motion at the end. One sign in the second ward located at 2233 West Division Street.

In the 27th ward, 1574 North Kingsbury. Two signs in the 28th ward located at 513 South Damon Avenue. In the 42nd ward, 1 East Pearson Street.

Also in 42, 615 South Wabash. And again in the 42nd ward, 1 North Wacker. Moving on to the 44th ward, five signs located at 331 West Surf Street.

Also in the 44th ward, 2900 North Lakeshore Drive. We have two signs in the 47th ward located at 3501 Northwestern Avenue. Moving on to the 48th ward, one sign at 6041 North Clark.

And lastly, in the 50th ward, 2536 West Devon Avenue. If no questions by committee members, do I hear a motion to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? That's Alderman Waguespack moves to pass.

Any objections? Hearing none, the orders are passed. And we've been joined by Alderman Gil Villegas.

We add it to the quorum call. We'll now move on to the regular agenda. In an effort to ensure the committee meeting runs as smoothly as possible, the typical order in which items will be heard has been updated.

Items will be grouped together according to witness attorney and will be heard in that order rather than the ward order. All right. As I said earlier, please, attorneys, we're trying to help by grouping you all together.

So please don't hog the mic too much. Let's get right to the germane points so we can ask questions by committee members. What else?

Okay, we're going to we're going to go to page one. However, we have heard from Sophia King, Alderwoman Sophia King. She would like that item hold until she arrives.

So we will move. Do we have someone here from the 19th Ward? Okay, great.

Come on up. Let me read into the record. This is on page one.

A8786 in the 19th Ward ordinance was referred on September 21st of 2022. And the common address is 10813 South Holman Avenue. And the change request from an RS2 residential single detached house district to a B11 neighborhood shopping district.

And we have Tristan Carnazes Angus. I'll just say Tristan here from the 19th Ward on behalf of Alderman O'Shea on this aldermanic. Would you proceed as to the intent?

[Speaker 47] (33:56 - 34:51)
So the address 10813 South Holman is currently Mount Greenwood School. It's a CPS school. Several years ago, approximately 13 years ago, they had a marquee sign installed on the home inside at that approximate address actually.

That was a digital traveling sign. The at the time, for one reason or another, the sign permit, which was obtained, did not go through zoning. So now they are looking to upgrade the sign, not the structure, just the interior to LCD.

And in order to do so, unfortunately the height of the sign was three inches too high, and it didn't fit with the zoning of RS2. So we have to change the zoning to B11, so the sign can get approved and then we plan to change it right back to residential.

[Speaker 1] (34:51 - 34:58)
Okay. Department. How did this happen.

[Speaker 8] (34:59 - 35:16)
I, Patrick Murphy zoning administrator for Department of Planning, I couldn't speak to how formerly assigned was not reviewed by zoning, but after a lot of discussions with the alderman this was the resolution to get the sign that the school wants. So I don't know historically how that happened.

[Speaker 1] (35:17 - 35:20)
So the B11 is the is the preferred.

[Speaker 8] (35:21 - 35:28)
It would be the lowest district that would allow them to get the signage that they would that they're seeking great questions by committee members.

[Speaker 1] (35:31 - 35:40)
Hearing none. Who's. Oh, Alderman Riley moves to pass on the item.

Any objections. Hearing none this item is passed.

[Speaker 39] (35:40 - 35:41)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (35:41 - 35:52)
Good luck. All right. All right now I have to.

We have a 44th Ward issue. Where's my vice chair. There you go.

All right.

[Speaker 19] (35:57 - 36:22)
Thank you. In the 44th Ward file number a dash 8793. The address is commonly known as 835 West Edison change request is a B1 dash three neighborhood shopping district to an RM dash six residential multi unit district.

This is an aldermanic request and Chairman Tony are you going to speak on this.

[Speaker 1] (36:23 - 37:12)
Have the attorney for affordable housing project. All right. So, as the alderman of this ward, and an area that is really difficult to find partners for affordability in in our ward.

We're excited to, to bring this forward again. This went through a community process. I think the attorney will explain the number of units but it's 100% affordable right across from the police station.

And, well, I'll let Liz Butler because she's better at the machination of time, and what happened with the ETO D and how it affected this project. Liz.

[Speaker 20] (37:12 - 39:50)
Thank you, Chairman. Good morning, Vice Chair for Boris and members of the committee. My name is Liz Butler.

I'm a partner at the law firm of taps detainees and Hollister located at 111 East Wacker in Chicago, along with my colleague, Braden Lord, we represent the development team which is a partnership between the Lakeview Lutheran Church, and the over the Rainbow Association, the property that is the subject of this change request is 835 West Addison. It's currently improved with a single story church building which has been in the community for decades. The development team proposed to redevelop the site with a six story building containing new facility for the religious assembly on the ground floor and above 37 units of all affordable barrier free accessible housing which will be affordable to individuals that are, or households that are earning between 40 and 30% of the area median income.

So, following a robust community process that was led by alderman German Tony and his chief of staff Bennett Lawson, including many many meetings with the community and with the immediate neighbors. The property was rezoned in 2020 to the B one three district to allow this project. The development team then spent 2021 securing financing for the project to move forward.

In the summer of 2022, the Chicago zoning ordinance was amended through the adoption of the connected communities ordinance that the change to the zoning ordinance imposed some new design requirements, and the ordinance that is before you today addresses some technical issues that will allow the project to move forward without any significant redesign so the project that was presented to the community and garnered support will be allowed to move forward through rezoning from the B one three to the RM six. And on behalf of the development team we're, we're grateful to chairman Tony for championing this project through what has been a long and multi phase approval process.

And we think the committee for its consideration of this request and respectfully request your favorable recommendation, I'm available to answer any questions that the committee might have. And I'll yield the floor back to chairman Tony in case he has further remarks.

[Speaker 1] (39:51 - 40:09)
Thank you, Liz. I know we're working with the department on the connected communities ordinance and some of the hiccups with pedestrian oriented and transparency in the ground floor and setbacks and stuff so there's more to come but specifically we moved it from B to our for this reason so we can move ahead with this project.

[Speaker 8] (40:10 - 40:40)
Patrick anything else right chairman, when we were first discussing this project, we didn't, we were not able to anticipate how the connected communities ordinance would ultimately be drafted and what the requirements would be. So that was why we recommended for the zoning change to begin with now having seen the final version of the ordinance, and some of the impacts that are specific to this project, it does not work as smoothly as we expected however there are things they can take advantage of to still use the new ordinance under the new district so that's why there's the map and then back to the residential district.

[Speaker 1] (40:41 - 40:49)
So we're excited to keep this project moving forward. And I asked for a positive recommendation from this committee questions.

[Speaker 39] (40:55 - 40:59)
I will ask that thank you.

[Speaker 19] (41:04 - 41:46)
There are no questions. All of them rarely makes a motion do pass by the same roll call used to determine quorum. Any objections.

None. The item is passed. Thank you, sir.

We're going to go in the middle of page three. The middle of page three in the 44th ward. File number 21189 for the address, commonly known as 3829 North Southport change request is a B3 dash to any shopping district to a B2 dash three neighborhood mixed use district.

We have an attorney Sarah Barnes to present the matter.

[Speaker 5] (41:46 - 43:03)
Thank you. Good morning, Vice Chair of whereas and esteemed members of the committee for the record. My name is Sarah Barnes and I'm an attorney at the offices of Sam banks.

Happy to be here this morning on behalf of the applicant Southport properties LLC. This is a little bit of a less exciting project but still offers community benefit. The proposal here calls for the conversion of an existing four story mixed use building that currently has one storefront on the first floor and three dwelling units above.

Despite the applicants, best and most prudent efforts over the course of the last year actively marketing at the first floor storefront. It has remained a vacant with no offers for tenancy. So as a result we are seeking to convert that existing first floor storefront into a dwelling unit that can be offered back into the community.

We have met with Alderman Tony and his staff as well as presented our proposal to the Lakeview Roscoe Village Chamber of Commerce, and the Southport neighbors Association, all of which who have offered their support for the project. I'm happy to answer any questions and again yield the floor back to Chairman Tony if he wants to make any remarks.

[Speaker 1] (43:03 - 43:03)
Thank you, Council.

[Speaker 5] (43:04 - 43:04)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (43:04 - 43:41)
Thank you for committee members, this stretch of Southport while it's a vibrant retail court or this particular block is, I'd say, well, blame schools on one side of the street, and then it's, you know, it's, you know, a lot of residential on the ground floor. And despite the vacancy for one year we've had so much turn we've had a lot of turnover on this particular section of two or three buildings there. And so, with the proper community process.

You know we're allowing this to go all residential, with the consent of this committee.

[Speaker 19] (43:43 - 44:33)
Thank you. Any questions. There are no questions.

Thank you. Alderman rebellious members of the committee. My name for the record is Tom Moore, and this is a property that the Kathy chase Zach lived in and this is brought by her estate the house was in disrepair.

It's surrounded on two sides by a nine story shopping center. But it is on a street that has multifamily uses. And so, the state would like to do a five dwelling unit condo on the property, and a five story five unit condo.

And so, we went through, we had meetings with the alderman, and the South Lake few neighbors association we had two meetings with them. We made a number of changes based on the request of the community organization. And we have everyone support that we know of and we request your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (45:43 - 46:21)
Thank you Councilman Tony. Thank you, committee members. This is the backside of century mall.

And it is completely shrouded by as the attorney says a nine story building so it is not the most desirable piece of property to begin with no alley. So, you know, we had to work with the estate and the attorney worked with the community process. And this is what resulted, and I'm comfortable, as is the community organizations to to approve this owning change and ask for your favorable consideration on this.

We have attorney Chris leach, who will make a presentation.

[Speaker 37] (47:23 - 49:00)
Good morning, Mr. Vice Chairman and members of the committee on zoning landmark and building standards. My name is Chris leach I'm sitting in for Meg George this morning who has the flu. I'm an attorney with the offices of Aikerman LLP located at 71 South Wacker Drive.

I'm appearing this morning on behalf of the applicant, Michael Nicholas, in connection with the proposed zoning amendment for the property located at 3346 North Lakewood Avenue. The subject property is located in 44th Ward is vacant and contains a site area of 3125 square feet. On November 20th 2019, the zoning of the subject property was changed from the R2 RT 3.5 district to the to a type one RT for zoning district for the construction of a single family home that was never built for which the type one zoning designation has since lapsed. The applicant seeks to change the zoning back to the original 3.3 RT 3.5 zoning district from the RT for district, and to remove the type one zoning deck designation in order to construct a single family home in conformance with the RT 3.5 zoning district. The applicant has met with alderman Tony concerning the proposed rezoning of the property back to its original zoning district, who we believe is in support but I'll let all my Tony speak on speak for himself. Present with me this morning is Michael Nicholas as I mentioned, the applicant and owner of the property.

I want to thank you for your time this morning, and we ask for your favorable recommendation and stand ready to answer any questions that you may have. Thank you very much.

[Speaker 19] (49:01 - 49:03)
Thank you Council element Tony.

[Speaker 1] (49:04 - 49:58)
Thank you, Chris and good morning. We've only talked on the phone. I know you're a constituent to begin with so you're moving within our ward which is great.

So a failed project that we did the type one, and we're reverting it back to the underlying zoning and it did, I know Mr Nichols plans to combine the two last one of which is not affected by today's action. But we look forward to his single family home and staying in the neighborhood. So, again, I, we've met with local neighbors is very click over there they know everything that's going on over there, and you're one of those neighbors actually to show.

So, I'm sure you did your due diligence, but no we've received no objections to that. And look forward for the finally a construction because the property has been sitting there for three years I think so. Hopefully with the consent of this committee we can move forward and get it start building this beautiful home.

Again, we have Sarah Barnes. Please. Chairman, and see members of the committee for the record once more.

My name is Sarah Barnes and I'm an attorney at the offices of Sam banks. I'm here this morning on behalf of the applicant Cortez ventures LLC who happens to actually be the same applicant for the next three matters, so I'm going to abbreviate the next three cases as well. I'm here this morning, seeking to zoning change which will allow for the legal establishment and permitting of an existing dwelling unit that is within the basement of the existing three story building that currently contains for dwelling units on Cortez ventures LLC acquired this property out of foreclosure it fell into a state of disrepair due to the previous ownership, and they are wanting to bring the building back into compliance with all the current codes and standards, and then we'll be offering back to the community at these dwelling units to see a voucher holders, so they will be affordable housing for the community. We have met with Alderman Hopkins and his staff, as well as presented the proposal to the Eckerd Park Community Council, who has offered their support for the project.

Alderman Hopkins jump back into chambers. So, I am here to answer any questions and would yield the floor to the Alderman Alderman Hopkins.

[Speaker 35] (57:12 - 57:44)
Yeah, thank you, Mr Chairman, is counselor said my comments to apply to the next three items as well all related to the same parcel on West Cortez street. We did meet with the neighbors, actually some improvements have been affected already to the structure. It has fallen into disrepair, and they look forward to those improvements being made they look forward to more affordable options in the community.

So we do have support from the immediate neighbors as well as the Eckerd Park Community Association I'm aware of no opposition and I would ask for an I vote on this item as well as the three related matters to follow. Thank you, Mr Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (57:45 - 57:59)
Questions, comments committee members. Just a quick comment so the, the number of units at 1423 will be how many total of four or those things that there's four and it's all affordable.

[Speaker 35] (57:59 - 58:08)
Am I hearing that right. Cha is through this will qualify for housing choice vouchers, right, any parking street parking readily available. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (58:09 - 58:45)
Other questions, comments. Otherwise, can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call by Alderman walks back makes the motion move to pass any objections to the motion. Hearing none this item is passed.

Again, we'll go down to document number 21198 again second ward ordinance was referred on October 26 of 2022.

[Speaker 5] (59:49 - 1:00:19)
Thank you once more for the record, Sarah Barnes, on behalf of the applicant. Once again, the only reason these were done is for separate applications is because these are all on the same two block stretch of Cortez but they are not contiguous properties, so I once more would reincorporate my testimony from item number 21197 for 1423 West Cortez and apply it to this matter, as all of the facts are the same.

[Speaker 1] (1:00:20 - 1:00:36)
Okay. Alderman Hopkins. Just just question so the all these units are affordable and limited parking, and the same this developer is pretty experienced in this management of this, this type of housing.

[Speaker 35] (1:00:36 - 1:01:14)
Yes, and as I mentioned there's street parking readily available there are detached garages, I can't speak to you know who's going to get a garage space or not that's up to the owner and renovations will be underway. But parking is generally not a problem on that stretch of Cortez and housing choice vouchers will be available so again it will be marketed as affordable. You know, it doesn't preclude market rate people from showing up and deciding to rent it, but it will be available for affordable housing choice voucher tenants as well.

Unique and I commend you, and the developer.

He's a contract purchaser there's been a long time vacant lot it's 24 by 124 feet and the application is for RS three to arm 4.5 to construct a three dwelling unit building, kind of a different design. There'll be three off street parking spaces. We approach Alderman Hopkins and the staff and they referred us to the equity Park Community Council, which requested a cut in height.

So we went from our five proposed to our four and a half. The final design of this type one application reflects a 45 foot height at the setback partial fourth floor, and based on the redesign, we're very grateful for Alderman Hopkins and his staff support.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:35 - 1:04:39)

[Speaker 35] (1:04:39 - 1:05:16)
Yeah, thank you, Mr Chairman, as Council mentioned, there had been some previous proposals for this lot which is got some challenges, due to the geography there. The previous proposals were greater in height and greater in density and were the subject of significant community opposition. This, however, is being met with community support, due to the reductions that were offered.

It has been a vacant lot for quite a long time. You know we've had a problem on this lot with fly dumping in the past. So the neighborhood is pleased to see construction will be taking place on this lot, and we do have support from the accurate Park Neighborhood Association I would urge and I vote.

I used to be a board member of Annie's legacy which provided support for women who experienced domestic violence and we have a shelter in the 46 word apnea Gar, which provides transitional housing for families, immigrant families who experienced domestic violence.

I would strongly strongly support advise you to connect with organizations like apnea Gar. They have learned so much. And you want to learn from your experiences so you don't have to start from the ground up by commend you on this domestic violence is the number one under reported crime in the United States, so I'm glad that you and your daughter are doing this apnea Gar I'll get you that information.

Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:17:10 - 1:17:16)
Okay. Alderman feel just a quick question.

[Speaker 15] (1:17:16 - 1:17:25)
I mean we mentioned that the ultimate is in support as well as notifications went out but was there a community meeting associated with this.

[Speaker 29] (1:17:27 - 1:17:41)
Thank you for the question on reveal. There was. I don't believe that there was community meeting that I was involved in the architect involved did tell me that they did have a community process with the Alderman.

[Speaker 15] (1:17:41 - 1:18:02)
Okay, what I'm curious what that process is the process may not include a, you know, every Alderman has a different process, I mean was there a scheduled community meeting, informing the residents within that 250 radiance about this particular zoning notices sent out to the community members within 250 foot radius.

[Speaker 29] (1:18:03 - 1:18:09)
There were no replies for that and there was no additional media after those notices were sent out. Waterman.

[Speaker 1] (1:18:12 - 1:18:18)
Anthony. Our offices receive no comments in the negative on this.

[Speaker 39] (1:18:19 - 1:18:23)
All right, thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:18:25 - 1:18:54)
You mentioned the question about that the women that will be in the shelter. I know Alderman Kevin talked about wraparound services and, you know, getting these people being safe number one, and back into productive society. You mentioned work.

Is there work requirements or what you mentioned that these women will be working.

[Speaker 21] (1:18:55 - 1:19:21)
Yes. When they leave the shelter. Most, they have.

We have support to get them jobs, we will give them support to get employment. And at that time, they will work, and only a portion about 20% of their income will go to toward housing. After the six months that they leave.

[Speaker 1] (1:19:24 - 1:19:43)
Okay, as I said, many members we do have a letter of support from Alderman Sawyer. With that, Alderman Pat Dowell makes a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum objections. Hearing none this item is passed.

Good luck to you. Thank you. And I know you're doing God's work.

Good morning members of the council my name is Shavon Murray, an attorney with Murray law group, and with me as my clients and the applicant, UD Lopez of racing mufflers and grapes. The subject property is a one story auto repair shop at the corner of Union and 43rd. The shop has been operating and in existence for the past over 50 years.

That's five zero years. And it closed last year it was operating as Stokes auto body, and they were a beloved member of the community. My clients purchase the property from Stokes auto and.

But their, their own business racing mufflers and breaks is a small family health business, and they've been actually operating as racing mufflers and breaks in Canary Ville and Bridgeport for the last six years. They currently rent a shop, and they purchased this to carry on the business that Stokes auto has been doing. We racing muffler breaks already has a foothold in the neighborhood.

They actually service a lot of other fleets for small businesses, some pizza parlors that you might be familiar with. And then they have a lot of just neighborhood individual clients as well. We did meet with older older woman Lee, and we have a letter of support from the older woman.

She did hold a community meeting. We actually have a lot of support in the community as well it's a service that's needed and since Stokes auto had been closed, and my clients have been just going over to the property and fixing up a little bit. The neighborhood has stopped by to see the my clients and say, are you opening back up we're excited to have you back.

[Speaker 1] (1:22:14 - 1:22:15)
When are you opening up.

[Speaker 33] (1:22:16 - 1:22:35)

[Speaker 1] (1:22:37 - 1:22:40)
So, Patrick, the license lapsed or what.

[Speaker 8] (1:22:40 - 1:22:44)

This is a small family business that my husband my brother in law, and I run we've been in canary, we've been in Bridgeport for six years, and we are excited to extend our business out to Canary Ville, like Shabam or he said the community is excited to have us there.

We have a very good reputation in the community and we also would like to extend this business not just for us but for other kids in the community that are probably looking to be mechanics as a trade and give them the opportunity to practice that trade in our business and provide this provide jobs for other people in the community that are also interested in, in that field. Well it's not a zoning issue how many employees, you think you right now I have five of my existing business, and I plan to have another five at the new location.

The case does have a substitute narrative and plans so I'd like to incorporate that into the record, please.

Alderman Robles moves to accept the substantive narrative plans for the type one application by the same roll call it was used to determine quorum. Any objections. Hearing none, the substantive narrative and plans are in front of us.

All right.

[Speaker 1] (1:37:22 - 1:37:37)
Now, are we looking at these, we're all doing these next three separately Patrick. Sorry, we're on page eight, each one separately. Yeah.

Okay. All right.

[Speaker 36] (1:37:37 - 1:37:37)
Yes, sir.

[Speaker 1] (1:37:37 - 1:38:26)
Starting on the top of page eight document number 2200 to 24th Ward ordinance was referred on October 26 of 2022 common addresses 8013 25 South Kilpatrick Avenue. Also 4607 to 4659 West Polk Street 4606 through 4658 West Arlington Street. Change request from M one to limited manufacturing business park district to M two to light industry district Montel gales.

The reason I mentioned that this is all one big piece of property with different addresses but basically the same ultimate goal.

[Speaker 8] (1:38:27 - 1:38:41)
From what I understand Jim is Patrick Murphy Department of Planning from what I understand there are also some vacations or other actions to try to unify some of these parcels so currently, currently they are not all contiguous but the ultimate goal is for them to become so that is that's why they're filed a separate applications now.

[Speaker 1] (1:38:41 - 1:38:44)
Okay, I knew I was briefed on this but pleasure.

[Speaker 2] (1:38:45 - 1:43:04)
Okay, good morning. Morning, Mr Chairman members of the committee my name is Montel gales I'm the corporate attorney for Cape Town Business Center LLC. I'm here today, and before I move too far.

I would like to provide my testimony for the next two applications as well. So, my testimony see what the questions are. Yes, sir.

I'm here today on behalf of the applicant and property owner Cape Town Business Center LLC Cape Town Business Center to LLC, and Mr Stephen L Davis Mr Davis is the owner of the LLC, which are located headquartered at least and at 401 South Carlton Avenue in Wheaton, Illinois, the properties for application number two to 002 are located at 801 through 825 South Kilpatrick Avenue 4607 through 4659 West Polk Street and 4606 through 4658 West Arlington Street. The landmass involved here is 146,594 square feet, or 3.365 acres. The properties for application number two to 003 are located at 4607 through 4659 West Arlington Street 4606 through 4610 West Fifth Avenue and 901 through 911 South Kilpatrick Street. The landmass involved there 72,028 square feet, or 1.6 acres of land. The properties for the application number two to 004 are located at 4614 through 4658 West Fifth Avenue and 915 through 923 South Kilpatrick Avenue landmass involved in that site is 37,287.5 square feet or point by point eight five acres. All properties are currently zoned in one to limited manufacturing business park district, and the applicant is requesting a zone change to that of a m two to light industry industry district. The aforementioned subject properties are improved with an existing one story 60,000 square foot warehouse building, located along Pope Street frontage with 68 existing off street parking spaces applicant proposes to construct an additional 60,000 square foot warehouse building towards Fifth Avenue which is nearest to the southern property line, with an additional 38 off street parking spaces. The applicant is seeking approval of map amended applications to comply with zoning use standards in order to operate light industry to accommodate moderate impact manufacturing wholesaling warehousing and distribution uses, including storage and work related activities that occur outside of our enclosed building.

In order to accomplish the proposed. We have filed three applications for map amendments to amend the zoning of this property from an M one to M one to two, excuse me, from an M one to limited manufacturing business park district to that of an M two to light industry district. We also have a pending street and alley vacation as mentioned earlier, application with the Department of Transportation.

Once the vacation application is granted the subject boundaries will be West Pope Street on the north property line. The railroad right away along the east property line. West Fifth Avenue along the south property line and South Kilpatrick Avenue along the west property line, creating one zoning lot.

I have the support of Alderman Scott, and I've sent proper notice to the community would like to say to that we've been working on this matter for two years, and this is a great day for us. With that in mind. Today I'm joined with professional land use consultant Karima square.

Last name is spelled in USA WW IR. Should you have any questions, we're here to answer those questions and last I'd like to say to. If you don't have any questions we'd like to also thank the staff for the assistance they provided us to getting to this point in time.

All right.

[Speaker 1] (1:43:05 - 1:43:23)
Staff, would you. We're going to take a motion on each of these separately, but for the holistic nature that Montel brought vacation is not part of this ordinance but this is give us a little bit of your interpretation from the department, or Anna.

[Speaker 8] (1:43:24 - 1:43:54)
So, I guess, just to summarize from his standpoint, the vacations being subsequent to the zoning actions the zoning actions all come independently, and they don't then collectively reach a high enough threshold to trigger a plan development. So they can proceed by right presuming the map amendment is approved being warehouse facilities, the new ones will be subject to the air quality ordinance so there'll be a community meeting process that precedes any permit issuance, but they would otherwise be able to proceed by right.

[Speaker 39] (1:43:57 - 1:43:58)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (1:43:59 - 1:44:13)
Questions and since you're no stranger to our committee. Would you like to add a few words about the appraisal, and such, or any input to this application.

[Speaker 31] (1:44:14 - 1:44:47)
Well, thank you Mr Chairman my name is Kareem so we're, as you indicated I am no stranger I'm a land plan plan use consultant in Chicago. So this is an application that we worked on for the past two years we met with the community and we met with the Ottoman, we've gotten the support that was required to go forward. This is an application, this is a project that will employ a number of people in the community.

We're excited about that. And we're hoping that will allow us to go forward and be approved.

[Speaker 1] (1:44:47 - 1:44:51)
Okay, I'll have a question but I'll wait for all the men Vegas.

[Speaker 42] (1:44:52 - 1:45:05)
Mr Chairman, not so much a question right but I have toward that facility that Mr Davis owns and I can tell you that they're doing some good things on on the west side there and employing lots of folks from the community and so definitely want to support this project when I put that on the record.

[Speaker 1] (1:45:07 - 1:45:20)
So, um, since I haven't toured the site. Are we relocating. You said somebody was from the suburbs, are we bringing jobs from the suburbs into the city.

[Speaker 2] (1:45:20 - 1:45:43)
No, sir. These jobs are at the existing facility, the existing 60,000 one story building. We've got a total of about 45 employees at that site, 70% of those folks are second chance citizens from the surrounding community.

The idea is and building the second building, it could lead up to 200 jobs in that area, and we'll be looking for employees in the surrounding community.

[Speaker 1] (1:45:43 - 1:45:51)
Okay, so we went from m one two to m two to tell me why, and the use category that that we're changing.

[Speaker 2] (1:45:51 - 1:46:06)
Well we need that because we want to do some outside storage as well. And the site currently manufactures streetlights street fixtures. So, imagine you know we have poles of the electronic gear that we can store outside if we're permitted.

[Speaker 1] (1:46:07 - 1:49:27)
Okay. And obviously the immediate neighbors are sounds like they've, they've been informed and are supportive. Yes, sir.

As the alderman is. All right. Any other questions comments.

So I'm going to start with the first item on eight, and that is document number 2202. This is Kilpatrick Polk and Arlington. Can I get a motion to move to pass on that application alderman Kaplan makes the motion move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections to that. Hearing none, this item is passed. In the second case I will read the entire narrative so that it's in the record this is document number 22003 24th Ward ordinance was referred on October 26 of 2022.

This common address is 4607 through 4659 West Arlington Street 4606 through 4610 West Fifth Avenue 901 through 911 South Kilpatrick. The change request, again, and one to limited manufacturing business park district and to to light industry district. You've heard the testimony.

Same as the previous any questions on that. If not Alderman deal makes a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections.

Hearing none, this item is passed. And lastly, I'll read into the record document number 22004 in the 24th Ward ordinance was referred October 26 of 2022. This common address 4614 through 4658 West Fifth Avenue, also 915 through 923 South Kilpatrick Avenue change request again and one to limited manufacturing business park district and to to light industry district.

Again, same narrative questions. Alderman Vegas makes a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to his motion.

Hearing none, this item is passed. And I think you're. I think we're finished.

Thank you, sir. We're not finished. I know you got seated.

No, you've got to see that you've got a little more, you got a little more work to do, but not from this committee. Okay, now we're back to page one we have all the woman King I believe is here. Let me read it into the record.

This is on page one document number a 8785 in the fourth Ward ordinance was referred on September 21 of 2022. Common Address 757 through 773 East Oakwood Boulevard, and the change request from a B three to community shopping district to RM five residential multi unit district older woman King. I know I think you're aware we had some public testimony, one in support and I think one in objection.

I don't know if they're still here. Okay, so the floor is yours. Thank you.

[Speaker 30] (1:49:28 - 1:50:57)
Thank you, Chairman, and I will turn over to my chief of staff in a second who deals with these issues of zoning and our office but this particular down zoning will actually be our, our first down zone in the ward since I've been alderman, except for one that we up zoned and then down zone. But this is coming, twofold. One, because the other.

The other residents, it's basically all in our in five on this particular block, except for this particular business. And so we wanted to be consistent and move towards residential, but it's also become a nuisance to the community. Just this past weekend there were calls to 911 for after hours partying.

Last weekend, it was the same and we've had numerous occasions where this particular are folks who are operating out of this particular address, have not been doing so with the community in mind. And so for two reasons, we'd like to down zone but I want my chief of staff apprentice Butler to speak to some more specifics. Thank you.

[Speaker 39] (1:50:57 - 1:50:59)
All right. Good morning.

[Speaker 45] (1:51:00 - 1:52:10)
So I just wanted to stay on record. My name is apprentice Butler and chief of staff for all in the Sophia King. This issue began a couple months ago with the concerns from the community about unsanctioned parties and other things happening at that location.

Now it is true that previously this area was commercial 3040 years ago. In the last 20 years we have nothing but residential on that block. So we received concerns from the community about making sure that the development area is consistent.

And we believe the highest and best use for the area right now is residential. So we have no problem with the owner of the business, we just want to make sure that if he does something with the property. It is done with transparency, and he works with the community about something that is acceptable for that block.

So we've had had a meeting back in September, about the operations of that business. And we're still not on the same page about what the operation should be that will be a good fit for that area. So while we take this action today to download that does not mean that we're against the business owner, and we're still willing to work with them on a proper plan of operation that will be suitable for the community.

[Speaker 30] (1:52:15 - 1:52:16)
Thank you. Thank you, Jim.

[Speaker 1] (1:52:16 - 1:52:20)
Okay, questions from committee members I know all the deal.

[Speaker 15] (1:52:21 - 1:52:31)
Thank you, Mr Chairman, I just want to clarify. So this isn't technically a down zone this is just a zoning change for future land plan usage correct.

[Speaker 1] (1:52:33 - 1:52:34)
Yes, thank you.

[Speaker 15] (1:52:34 - 1:52:37)
To get that clarification on the record. Thank you.

[Speaker 24] (1:52:38 - 1:52:39)
Thank you all.

[Speaker 1] (1:52:39 - 1:52:40)
I'm sorry.

[Speaker 24] (1:52:40 - 1:52:55)
Thank you Chairman side, quick question because I want to make sure we're following the legality of all this would would this act. Decrease the value of this property.

[Speaker 8] (1:52:56 - 1:53:14)
Not going to be able to answer that question maybe the art department can Patrick Murphy from the Department of Planning, I could not forecast how this could be evaluated from a land land value standpoint based on the zoning district would depend on what the proposed new use may be compared to what's there today.

[Speaker 24] (1:53:15 - 1:53:33)
We would not typically assign evaluation to a map amendment request, because I don't want us to venture into the realm of doing a taking. Right. So I am, where is the owner.

How does the owner set with this change in zoning.

[Speaker 1] (1:53:36 - 1:53:42)
Well, let's ask the alderman's office. Have you met, because they were obviously given notice.

[Speaker 30] (1:53:42 - 1:53:44)
So, yeah. Is the owner here.

[Speaker 1] (1:53:45 - 1:53:48)
I know we had two witnesses this morning. Hold on, hold on.

[Speaker 30] (1:53:49 - 1:53:53)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, he's, he's not the one witness I know is not the owner.

[Speaker 1] (1:53:53 - 1:54:12)
I will just for the record, because we did have two people testify and I'll make that. Neither of those were the owner of Mr. Brad and, and Mr. Reed, Mr Reed was opposed to it. And Mr Pratt was in support of it.

And we're not going to, they did make their public testimony.

[Speaker 30] (1:54:13 - 1:54:37)
And, yeah, so that all neither of those are the owner we tried to reach out to the owner we haven't been able to. And that's part of the issue that he's got lessees who are not doing what we feel is in the best interest of the community with the parties, and, you know, and so it was very clear on that on the, on the issue.

[Speaker 1] (1:54:37 - 1:54:55)
Okay, so the in the testimony with the public speaker that was opposed to it. Can we elaborate a little bit on the complexity of the block is I think, yeah, I think Prentice said that the majority was an hour five and this is consistent so if you know for the record.

[Speaker 30] (1:54:56 - 1:55:03)
Yeah, so the entire chairman that they're all of the block except for this establishment is RM five. Yeah.

[Speaker 1] (1:55:04 - 1:55:08)
Okay. Okay, all the woman down wants to supplement that.

[Speaker 12] (1:55:09 - 1:55:35)
And I'll add to that I represent the area just west of this along Alderman King and I share Oakwood Boulevard Oakwood Boulevard is a historic areas historic street, mostly all residential, except for this building which I believe has been vacant. Maybe you could confirm that but I think it's been vacant for a number of years. Yes.

[Speaker 1] (1:55:36 - 1:55:57)
Okay, so I know I think Alderman Beals said it correctly, you know, this is about land use planning and consistent with the nature of, of the block, and, you know, I just wanted to see because we do have the witnesses here I want to make sure that they, whether they agree or disagree that we have this discussion.

[Speaker 24] (1:55:58 - 1:56:14)
No, I appreciate that. All right, Alderman Kaplan final question then, with the city's law department have any issue with this. I mean if there was, if the owner of filed a lawsuit.

Would there be high likelihood that the city would lose.

[Speaker 1] (1:56:16 - 1:56:27)
I, I'm not the lawyer in the room but I think we've put a case in front that there is consistent and there's logic in planning on this block that could be sustained in a, in a, in a court of law.

[Speaker 24] (1:56:27 - 1:56:28)
Okay, thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:56:29 - 1:56:35)
This is not the first time that we just want to be very very careful here.

[Speaker 24] (1:56:35 - 1:56:36)
All right. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:56:36 - 1:56:40)
All right, so, um, Alderman Osterman yeah.

[Speaker 11] (1:56:41 - 1:56:52)
Just a question of clarification because I think the two speakers that I believe spoke in opposition reference that they are firemen.

[Speaker 1] (1:56:52 - 1:57:02)
One spoken in support, and once support was in opposition, I think the person who is the fire person was in opposition.

[Speaker 11] (1:57:02 - 1:57:45)
Right, opposition to the zoning change. I guess the point I'm trying to the question or suggestion is that if there are city employees that are running or operating a business that is causing consternation to neighbors in that community I would think that there are. In addition to this zoning change that the Alderman is putting forth.

I think there's ways to deal with that behavior and operation. In addition to this so I think I know Alderman and her chief of staff will take that other those other avenues up, and I think the law department should look into that as well so, but otherwise move to pass when it's appropriate.

[Speaker 39] (1:57:45 - 1:57:50)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (1:57:50 - 1:58:03)
Any other questions, comments. All right, Alderman Osterman makes the motion move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to the motion from committee members.

Hearing none, this item is passed.

[Speaker 30] (1:58:03 - 1:58:05)
Thank you, Chairman. Thank you, members of the committee.

[Speaker 1] (1:58:06 - 1:58:43)
All right. Now we're moving on to top of page nine. All right.

Document number 21181 t one in the 25th ward common addresses 2332 through 2344 South Princeton Avenue, also 301 through 309 West 23rd place, and the change request from a B to five neighborhood mixed use district and RT for residential to flat townhouse and multi unit district, all to a B to five neighborhood mixed use district. Rich Tom.

[Speaker 26] (1:58:43 - 2:00:52)
Thanks. Good. Good morning.

Chairman Tony members of the zoning committee. My name is rich 12th I'm an attorney at 20 South Clark Street in Chicago. I know reasonable minds may differ but I'm glad to be back in person and to see everyone.

I'm appearing on behalf of the applicant shanks Houghton LLC, whose principal is Johnny saying, who is next to my farthest right regarding application number 21181, which seeks a zoning change from what is mostly a B to dash five zoned property to and partially RT for to a uniform B to dash five district. The applicant has successfully completed other projects in the area. The properties at the southwest corner of Princeton Avenue and 23rd place in the 25th ward.

The property is mostly vacant, although there's an existing residential building on the western most lot that will be redeveloped for the project. The city previously rezoned, most of this parcel to be to dash five for our proposed building. But since then the owner developer acquired saw an opportunity to acquire an adjacent lot that western most lot, which we are now seeking to incorporate into the development, the design is for a new mixed use building with commercial space on the first two floors and 32 dwelling units above the applicant of course interacted and met with the alderman who hosted a community meeting.

There was way back when there was a community meeting for the original design. But more recently, there was a community meeting for this revised design that we bring you today that incorporates the new additional lot. I know the alderman was here earlier but he did, I believe, provide you with a letter of support.

I have a copy of that if that's useful. I'll mention to the development will comply with the affordable housing ordinance. It's a 20% arrow site.

And on behalf of the applicant we request your favorable recommendation.

[Speaker 1] (2:00:58 - 2:01:04)
Thank you, rich alderman CTO Lopez. Oh, he did provide a letter.

[Speaker 39] (2:01:04 - 2:01:04)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:01:05 - 2:01:43)
So, you, you, he did provide. Okay, I just saw him but he must have left. Okay.

Alrighty, so we do have a letter of support from Alderman CTO Lopez. And do we have any questions comments from committee members. I just have one before I entertain a motion.

And I'm sorry I was a little. Not 100% attentive. So this is a 32 unit dwelling unit.

Is this affordability.

[Speaker 26] (2:01:43 - 2:01:55)
Sure. Of course alderman, it is a, it's going to be compliant with the affordable housing ordinance. This is a 20% arrow site, and we will be compliant with that.

[Speaker 1] (2:01:55 - 2:02:07)
Great. Okay. Other questions, if not, Alderman Pat Dowell moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

The objections. Hearing none, this item is passed.

[Speaker 26] (2:02:07 - 2:02:08)
Thank you all.

[Speaker 1] (2:02:08 - 2:02:39)
All right. middle of page nine document number 21191 in the 26th ward ordinance was referred on October 26 of 2022. The common address that this is 911 North Mozart Street, and the change request from an RS three residential single unit detached house district to an RT for residential two flat townhouse and multi unit district.

Colin Hudson.

[Speaker 18] (2:02:40 - 2:04:28)
Yes hi good morning my name is Colin Hudson excited to be here and meet with you all today. So my wife Vanessa back off for arrow and I purchased this property, and the summer of 2020. It is a, it's two full city lots of 25 by 125.

I have a few slides up here we can just go ahead and keep on if you don't mind. So this is 911 and 913 North Mozart. It's RS three zoning, and what we realized is that we're not using the empty lot at 913 Mozart.

And so we thought for our family, the best use of this is to potentially sell this. So I met with the alderman Maldonado in September, he gave me his blessing and so that he would support moving forward with this project. I've been working independently just following the leather of the law in terms of the application process that I found online that found in a real list to be incredibly helpful in terms of revising that and helping me just get that across the finish line.

And what we're ultimately asking for is zoning amendment change to 911 which is currently a three unit apartment building that's probably existed since the late 1800s. To be instead of RS three and RT four. So that's a specific zoning amendment that we're asking for.

And really this is bringing the zoning in line with the character of the neighborhood. As you'll see on the entire block, there's an average of roughly 2.8 units per developed a lot. And on the east side of Mozart specifically, there's almost three points, three, 3.2 to be exact, number of units per developed a lot. So really what we're asking for is the up zone of 911 so we have the option in the future if we wanted to to separate and sell 913 North Mozart.

[Speaker 39] (2:04:30 - 2:04:30)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:04:35 - 2:04:38)
We, and we have not.

[Speaker 18] (2:04:39 - 2:05:19)
We do not have a letter of support from Alderman Maldonado, as we speak, that's correct. So it reminds me that Seinfeld episode where we made the reservation but we didn't keep the reservation I met with him he gave me his verbal. Support.

I didn't know that I needed to have it in writing and so it's been told to me that I need to come back December 13, hopefully in the interim time I can meet with him and get that in writing. If not via email I don't know what other forms of communication would be sufficient. If we could phone them and get support on the phone would love to do that right now as well.

Well we've tried. So, what we're going to do is going to hold it.

[Speaker 1] (2:05:19 - 2:05:37)
Okay, we're going to try to work with the alderman, and you to have our second meeting which is when December, December 13, which, if it passes on the 13th, you'll lose no time. Okay. Okay, because all our all these applications will be at the next city council meeting which is the 14th.

[Speaker 15] (2:05:37 - 2:05:37)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:05:37 - 2:05:50)
Okay. So, give us a little patience. I know, you know, but it's custom that we need to have a lot of support from the alderman and we tried.

Okay, a little bit of work to do between now and the next meeting. All right.

[Speaker 36] (2:05:50 - 2:05:50)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:05:50 - 2:06:39)
So, with that, all of in, can I get a motion to defer this item, the same roll call. That was all the men vice chair voice makes the motion to defer this item to date certain next meeting. December 13.

Okay. So, any objections to the motion. Hearing on this item will be deferred to date certain on the 13th.

Okay. Page nine in the 27th ward document number 21180. The ordinance was referred October 26 of 2022, and the common address is 1361 West Chicago Avenue and the change request from the one to neighborhood shopping district to be two three neighborhood mixed use district.

And we have Ali Manish.

[Speaker 42] (2:06:41 - 2:06:46)
Good morning. My name is elimination the owner of that property.

[Speaker 1] (2:06:47 - 2:06:48)
Sorry, you're the owner of this property.

[Speaker 42] (2:06:48 - 2:06:49)
Yes, sir.

[Speaker 1] (2:06:49 - 2:06:50)
Okay, proceed.

[Speaker 42] (2:06:50 - 2:07:19)
And this property ever since I moved to that neighborhood, making laws, and recently, opportunity came that I sold another property, so I could buy this lot. And it's a substandard law is 24 by 92. And I was hoping to be able to rezone it so we'd be able to build enough building to make economic sense.

So that's what we are applying for the two dash three.

[Speaker 1] (2:07:19 - 2:07:22)
All right. And how did you engage the alderman or the community.

[Speaker 42] (2:07:22 - 2:07:59)
Well, first men to all the men and the parents instruction for this that's the instruction we went to a community council and got their approval, and they send a letter to all the men and then after that we had a meeting community meeting for all the requests, and nobody I mean only a couple of people showed up. And then, from that point, blessing from all the men we moved on to send our application to the city and get to this point so you went through the office community meeting correct such anything else with your testimony.

[Speaker 1] (2:08:00 - 2:08:02)
That's it. We're gonna hear from Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 41] (2:08:03 - 2:08:24)
Thank you very much, Mr Chairman yeah this gentleman is, I guess represent himself, you're doing a good job. He. So he did come to us we did we did send them to the local community organization which is that got Park Community Council.

We had a community meeting. No one had a problem with what he's proposing to do so we asked for the committee support.

[Speaker 1] (2:08:25 - 2:08:38)
Right. All right, questions from committee members. Hearing none Alderman deal makes the motion move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections. Hearing none, this item is passed.

[Speaker 39] (2:08:38 - 2:08:39)
Thanks for coming down.

[Speaker 1] (2:08:40 - 2:09:07)
All right, top of page 10. We are on document number 22006 28th board. This address, ordinance was referred on October 26 of 2022 common address 722 South Laughlin Street, and the change request from an RT for residential two flat townhouse and multi unit district to an RM five residential multi unit district, Roberto Martina.

[Speaker 34] (2:09:08 - 2:10:55)
Good morning committee. Good afternoon at this time. I've been prepared since the morning I'm really excited.

This is my first in person presentation, and I've been waiting for 10 years to do this. My name is Roberto Martinez, and I am with the law offices of Martinez law LLC at 4115 West 26th Street seated beside me is the applicant, Mary and Joseph follows. We are here today to request a rezoning at the subject property.

The land has been improved with a three unit building three story and a half, utilizing the basement. The basement currently is not a unit, but the applicant intends to rezone the property to have this basement utilized as a as a unit. Additionally, there is a accessory dwelling unit to the rear on this lot.

So there will be a total of five units, should this be approved. Some of the concerns would be parking but there are five spaces. Additionally, we did speak with the alderman and a letter of non objection was presented to the, to the committee.

Finally, Mr. Palos has resided at this location for many years and has actually owned the building. Since 1984, and allowing this rezoning to be granted would give the family the opportunity to bring more family into the basement unit. Since the property is mainly occupied by family.

[Speaker 39] (2:10:57 - 2:10:58)
Great.

[Speaker 1] (2:10:59 - 2:11:02)
Would either of you like to say a few words to the committee.

[Speaker 46] (2:11:03 - 2:11:14)
I've had the building since he was fortunate to get a buyout from channel five as an engineer at the 45 years. So I was going to utilize the money from the buyout to put in a garden apartment.

[Speaker 1] (2:11:14 - 2:11:16)
And you are.

[Speaker 46] (2:11:16 - 2:11:48)
I'm Tony Palos. And the owner and then also my wife Mary. And the first one I have my sister, there's nine of us in the family nine siblings so she's the baby.

So, kind of give her a bunch of a discount on the rent as possible. And then the second floor it's two nephews. So, I don't charge what the neighborhood demands or could sustain their but they're living there.

So the garden apartment would help subsidize the rest of the family that's living there.

[Speaker 1] (2:11:49 - 2:11:56)
So, Mr Martinez, or Mr palos, the existing building as how many units.

[Speaker 34] (2:11:56 - 2:12:06)
Sound like you have a front end rear storage units in the lot, but the first building has three units, three in the front, three in the front and then we have a coach house in the room.

[Speaker 1] (2:12:06 - 2:12:27)
And with this improvement, so to speak, how many units total five, five units, so you're adding one. Right, right, it's an empty basement, I just want to put it apart and it's not in a DU area, I presume. Patrick.

Yes, sir. In the 28th ward on the South Laughlin, is that not in a DU area.

[Speaker 39] (2:12:29 - 2:12:57)
I will confirm it just a second. And you said there was enough parking. Yeah, there's a three car garage and then a two car garage there's five spots.

All right, well we do have a lot of support from all the nerve and you're somebody in the coach house now right yeah we live in the coaches.

[Speaker 46] (2:12:57 - 2:13:16)
I used to be a real coach house for carriages and horses. And I was blessed to be able to be able to remodel it and fix it up and everything so we've been living in, since we've been there we're trying to give your attorney a little run for his money. Yeah.

Chairman, it is.

[Speaker 1] (2:13:16 - 2:13:34)
Okay, not in a DU area that's why we're doing the zoning change. Any other questions or comments if not. Alderman was back moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine form.

Any objections. Hearing none, this item is passed. Good luck to you.

[Speaker 39] (2:13:34 - 2:13:36)
Thank you. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:13:36 - 2:13:58)
All right, middle page 10 document number two to 009 t one in the 28th Ward ordinance was referred October 26 of 2022. Common address is 3450 West Lake Street and the change request from m one three limited manufacturing business park district to be two three neighborhood mixed use district. Steve Friedland.

[Speaker 43] (2:13:58 - 2:15:17)
Good afternoon, Mr Chairman Steve Friedland with the law firm of Applegate and Thorne Thompson. Here on behalf of sky art NFP, a not for profit that provides free art programs to youth in Chicago with me today is Devin Maldonado who is a staff member with sky art. The request is to rezone the property of 3450 West Lake from m one dash three to be two dash three.

The property is currently basically a warehouse building that's unoccupied. And what sky are intends to do is to occupy the entire structure as a children's play center, where they will do there are programming sky are currently provides their services in many many schools in Chicago, but they also have a facility on the south side at 3026 East 91st Street, where they provide art therapy and art activities for youth. There, they would like to have a second facility on the west side which is how they found this site they'll be leasing it.

We have met with Alderman urban, and we would ask the committee's approval.

[Speaker 1] (2:15:19 - 2:15:29)
And we do have a letter of support from all the urban. And let me ask for the record, would you identify yourself.

[Speaker 44] (2:15:29 - 2:15:33)
Yeah, my name is Devin been held another I'm the director of programs at sky are the nonprofit.

[Speaker 1] (2:15:34 - 2:15:51)
Well thank you for what you do and expanding in the city. The. I'm not familiar with the area other than it seems like it's almost an industrial area historic or warehouse area.

How does the Children's Activity Center blend in with.

[Speaker 44] (2:15:52 - 2:16:45)
It's actually really close to the park. It's actually right across lake from Garfield Park the park itself. And also additionally we already work in schools in that area so actually before the pandemic.

We already had this goal of expanding to the west side. We started working in schools, right before the pandemic and since then we actually work with several schools in the area. So it's a strategically located building with lots of schools around.

And there's actually several nonprofits in the area just literally next door there's another nonprofit that works with justice involved use, who are, you know, they're working with them to give them jobs in construction and building. So actually I think the locations, fairly perfect we also work at IYC Chicago ID JJ the Illinois Department of Juvenile Justice is Chicago location which is literally just down Lake Street, that's another location where we work with incarcerated youth. So it actually it's like for us it's a perfect location.

[Speaker 1] (2:16:45 - 2:16:56)
Fantastic. Well, thank you for what you do. Any questions comments from committee members.

We'll start with all. All right. One down.

[Speaker 12] (2:16:57 - 2:17:09)
Thank you to the gentleman from the 27th floor. Are you located any in others in Southside schools, like in Bronzeville anywhere you.

[Speaker 44] (2:17:09 - 2:17:22)

Otherwise, we're seeking your approval of our application to amend the zoning on this property from B to one to see one one. Thank you chairman of community.

[Speaker 1] (2:22:34 - 2:22:38)
Thank you. I think we'll have a question or two but we'll start with all the men feel.

[Speaker 15] (2:22:39 - 2:22:49)
Thank you, Mr Chairman. You're asking for a parking relief how many people are you looking to have inside this banquet hall spaces, do you have available.

[Speaker 14] (2:22:50 - 2:23:09)
Right now, I'm on street parking is hosted street so the business is open area is business on the side of the south and the west part of hosted so it's like plenty space of parking. Maybe about a, I'm say about 50 people maybe it's very small only 1600 square feet so.

[Speaker 15] (2:23:10 - 2:23:13)
Okay, what is the venue space what is the venue.

[Speaker 14] (2:23:13 - 2:23:28)
It's a bit space so people can have baby showers. Maybe very small intimate weddings community organizations can have things. I've also had business they can want to come in and show their brand and different things like that.

[Speaker 15] (2:23:29 - 2:23:32)
Okay. And what are the hours of the facility.

[Speaker 14] (2:23:33 - 2:23:57)
Most of the time people in the daytime and then maybe up to like 12 midnight sometimes very rare as well as midnight. Also, do other businesses during the week. So, from Monday to Friday also have a task consultant services I do, and I do employ the neighborhood, have a couple of guys that come work for me they come help clean up they do different things they around the community so.

[Speaker 15] (2:23:58 - 2:24:01)
And so you're not going to serve food or have liquor in the facility.

[Speaker 14] (2:24:02 - 2:24:21)
No, no, no, no, no, I don't have, I don't want to look at it all. So, if someone comes in and they have to be like free wine or something like that they cannot I will not happen. I will not want to look at people who have food they have have catering license as well I think I was already before I think my zoning was for that I was okay with having food.

[Speaker 15] (2:24:22 - 2:24:31)
Okay, now you're saying you're not going to have a liquor license but you're not going to allow be wild be or, yes, they can have be well be so you are going to have liquor in the facility.

[Speaker 14] (2:24:32 - 2:24:32)
Yes.

[Speaker 15] (2:24:32 - 2:24:33)
Okay. Okay.

[Speaker 14] (2:24:35 - 2:24:43)
And I will have security for that so if they have to have be wild be if it's one of those situations. What is be wild be I will secure the property, just in case.

[Speaker 15] (2:24:44 - 2:25:08)
Okay, reason I just have concerns that, you know, I mean that area is has the challenges, going from hundred 19 down to hundred 2526 and Halsted, and adding another venue space. I mean, baby showers, I mean I don't see baby showers going till midnight, or, you know, different events I've had breast cancer events that actually did in the 12 o'clock.

[Speaker 14] (2:25:08 - 2:25:31)
Things like that and open space no, no DJ and I'm already done so I had like a community things already I'm have a tech service that's been there for years I've been on the property for a while. Where I'm at, I've had no issue, anything over there have no issues over there. So, I'm not sure but I have this stuff that is south of me, you know, but a pretty it's been pretty quiet where I'm at.

[Speaker 1] (2:25:32 - 2:25:36)
Thank you, Mr. Other questions. All the other woman down.

[Speaker 12] (2:25:37 - 2:25:59)
Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Miss precise consulting corporation Do you have a plan of operation or do you intend on entering into a plan of operation at this location. Has this been brought to your attention.

Um, no, no. I'm sorry my name is Tiffany Connie. Okay, so I'm sorry.

[Speaker 14] (2:26:00 - 2:26:07)
My name is Timmy. I am the owner of the building in the business. Besides consulting and all of the business as well.

[Speaker 12] (2:26:08 - 2:26:38)
I've had no, I had when you say when you mean by you like if something happens or can you can typically venues and have a can enter into a plan of operation with the department of business. Business Affairs and consumer protection I, I sure I'm sure you have your license from them right. No, I don't have haven't.

I don't have a license for people you have not gone that far.

[Speaker 14] (2:26:38 - 2:26:41)
I've tried. Okay, wait for this only. All right.

[Speaker 12] (2:26:42 - 2:26:57)
Well, my, I would encourage you to think about entering into a plan of operation for your venue. Given what I'm hearing might be challenges along Halstead. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:26:58 - 2:27:25)
Okay, thank you. Thank you. Other questions.

I, I have a question or two. What is the need for a C zoning. What kind of activities that require to see because you could still get a PPA with a B license and if you're not doing liquor, other than a BYO and or caterers license.

I just don't I don't know what the need for the C part of it.

[Speaker 14] (2:27:25 - 2:27:34)
I have tried to apply I'm sorry, I'm trying to apply for, and they told me I needed to see license as well I've tried to profit a PPA like you were told based on the activity.

[Speaker 1] (2:27:35 - 2:27:36)
Yes.

[Speaker 39] (2:27:38 - 2:27:41)
Correct. No.

[Speaker 1] (2:27:43 - 2:28:33)
Was that was that from zoning or from licensing licensing. I've been, you know, normally see is a very permissive part of our zoning code. It does allow for taverns it does provide us other things and, you know, that would be, that's, you know, you'd want to make sure that the zoning matches the activity, like a glove on a hand and not be more permissive so you know I just, you know, we're not the zone, we're not the business and licensing affairs.

But if there's not a request for a liquor license. It, you know, you mentioned a PPA which is the public place of amusement. It just, I'm just wondering how the C recommendation came to our committee.

Go ahead.

[Speaker 39] (2:28:36 - 2:28:41)
Yes, Mr Chairman Kareem was somewhere again the land use consultant, did you speak into the mic isn't.

[Speaker 31] (2:28:41 - 2:29:02)
Yes. So, the. I was told by the applicant that the C was requested but I believe it could also be accomplished in the B3 district, and you read that the board said the committee sees fit to amend this to see B3 then I think the business that's proposed to be operated.

[Speaker 1] (2:29:03 - 2:29:19)
I can't speak for the older woman, because we do have a letter of support, I could entertain a motion to amend it at your request, because it's it's it's a more limited zoning. Is that. Let me ask the attorney.

[Speaker 22] (2:29:21 - 2:29:29)
You know I'm actually fairly new to this situation, and we've been having the land use consultant handle mostly everything here from here on out.

[Speaker 39] (2:29:29 - 2:29:30)
Sorry, could you say it again.

[Speaker 22] (2:29:30 - 2:29:48)
I said I'm mostly new to the, to the actual matter at hand period, and the land use consultant has been handling most of it. And I believe that when she was told I think that there was something specific that you were doing on the property, was it the DJ, it's like if you can't.

[Speaker 14] (2:29:48 - 2:30:08)
I'm sorry Tiffany Carnegie, that they told her that she needed to see that I needed to see or I think she said it could be three if I'm not mistaken she did like this, it could be a B3 that I couldn't have any live entertainment or live entertainment, or if it was a B1, B3, and see one can have a live entertainment.

[Speaker 1] (2:30:08 - 2:30:27)
See one should actually like a lot mean that, as you know, and see category opens up a lot of uses that I'm, you know, again I'm not going to speak for the for the older woman. The, what would department, what do we what do we want to do here.

[Speaker 8] (2:30:28 - 2:31:19)
Well, I, it sounds as though some of the PPA requirements about entertainment, and the license are getting conflated with some of the zoning allowances because some of the, some of the activities that would be subject to a PPA, or I'm sorry, that wouldn't might not be subject to a PPA could be done in a lower zoning district. So, maybe there's some confusion about the intensity of the activity, and then that triggering a PPA, but simply going to a higher zoning district doesn't absolve you from the PPA issues which are licensing related and not zoning related, so it just sounds like some of those are slightly slightly being conflated between the two different sets of regulations, the B3 could accommodate the use, but based on the entertainment activity referenced, it might still be triggering a PPA based on your capacity, or if you're charging for tickets for admission.

[Speaker 14] (2:31:20 - 2:31:23)
Oh, yeah, I'm not charging for admission but yes, if your capacity is over 100.

[Speaker 1] (2:31:24 - 2:31:54)
We're not that formal. Okay, you can introduce yourself again. Okay, we're just trying to, we're trying to help.

Okay, we also want to make sure that there's protections for the zoning, about what could be done by right. And not to not to impede but to make sure that you're purporting what you're doing, and the zoning that would qualify for it without giving you a lot of extra zoning that from a use perspective. Yeah, much from a density.

[Speaker 14] (2:31:54 - 2:32:23)
So, Tiffany card again I when I talked to the people in the license department, they was asked them I say, by me being the one I'm able to do a lot of things, what is the difference between, because I'm able to have food. Any type of business that does not they said the thing was the live entertainment. Um, there's no, they're not panicking and anything like that so there's not a paid venue, like, it's not a club so I didn't understand it either but then they said that be three will probably work as well but because they think the lab is a DJ, I rely on your team.

[Speaker 1] (2:32:24 - 2:33:04)
What do you want to do it and have live entertainment, I do it and have live entertainment, I mean to be a B3. Well it's 1600 square feet they haven't determined you have you don't have an occupancy plaque they haven't yet. We expect it to be about I would assume it's 50.

Depends on. It actually depends on, you know, because the tavern you have different activities in a restaurant. So, I mean it gets a little complicated but given the fact that 1600.

Sit down and and and square feet I think is per person I can't remember what the, what the code says on that one but is it.

[Speaker 31] (2:33:04 - 2:33:29)
Well, Mr Chairman, the suggestion to make it a B3 dash one district I believe would be acceptable. They do have tables sometimes so then the capacity is about 50 people but in the event that they have chairs then it's greater. And so it may end up being a medium venue, rather than a small venue so I think the.

[Speaker 1] (2:33:29 - 2:34:01)
Again, that's the permanent permanent on the US in the building department and some other things you know, I, I don't want to impede what we're here to help, but I were not the building and licensing department, however, is this is a lesser zoning would not be required to be reposted. There's a request is a B3, what was it requested to see one dash one.

[Speaker 8] (2:34:02 - 2:34:14)
Well, that's the last three dash one, the one that they wouldn't have such and they wouldn't have to repost, but they would have to submit for a substitute. They can do that at the.

[Speaker 1] (2:34:15 - 2:35:04)
Okay, here's, here's what I want to do. Here's what I think we should do. You don't mind.

Can we give it a rest and not make a decision today. And then also go in, we can still get it done by the December meeting, so we do have two meetings in this period. So can we get some clarification and some communication with the alderman.

We certainly, you know, want to make sure that the community is protected. You're in business to do business. I just, I just am a little nervous about a C zoning on that stretch given the type of activity that you're doing.

And what could be allowed under the seat. And I'm not that fluent on the C one part but I know, see his taverns for sure.

[Speaker 8] (2:35:06 - 2:35:08)
From a, from an alcohol standpoint.

[Speaker 1] (2:35:09 - 2:36:39)
So if you guys all change your mind. Then, the C one, you could flip it to be a tavern without any zoning. Oh, it's not big enough for town but trust me, these are these are rights associated with this property.

So that's why we want to make sure that we're assisting you in the type of activity that you want and also protecting. You know the community in terms of what it could be if we actually approve this owning change so if you would beg me to defer not to hold this until December meeting and we will have a talk with the older woman, and probably a talk with the ACP. But I think Alderman Alderman Dow is a point, anything or anything with alcohol, whether it's catered or BYO could should trigger what's called a plan of operation.

This is, this is the rules of how we're running our establishment. This is what we commit to the neighbors in the community. And that is normally a written document that can be held with that license and saying hey, this is, this is what you're purported to do this is what you're not doing.

We have a problem. And so that's regardless of whatever zoning is. I think, even in, I don't even want to say the idea that you're, you're basically telling me that liquor is going to be entertained at this facility.

You know, and the last question I have, is there a kitchen in this thing.

[Speaker 14] (2:36:40 - 2:36:47)
It is. It's not a active stove just a microwave and refrigerator. Refrigerator refrigerator sorry.

[Speaker 1] (2:36:47 - 2:36:50)
Okay, most of your stuff is going to be catered in.

[Speaker 39] (2:36:50 - 2:36:51)
Yeah.

[Speaker 1] (2:36:51 - 2:37:14)
All right. Then I'm. Can I get a.

We need a motion to hold this one. Okay, so we're gonna I'm going to entertain a motion to defer this one meeting. So we get our, you know, ducks in order.

Okay, just so that we're all on, we're all on the same page moving in the same direction. Okay.

[Speaker 12] (2:37:14 - 2:37:15)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:37:15 - 2:37:31)
Okay. I get a motion to defer this item until the date certain Alderman be all makes the motion to defer it date certain until December 13. Okay.

And you know what I'll do. We'll put you in the front of the meeting. So I don't want you to just want to do some homework right.

[Speaker 14] (2:37:32 - 2:37:32)
Okay, yes.

[Speaker 39] (2:37:33 - 2:37:34)
Yes, we are.

[Speaker 1] (2:37:35 - 2:37:40)
Alrighty, so this item will be deferred. Okay, thank you.

[Speaker 39] (2:37:41 - 2:37:41)
Thank you so much.

[Speaker 1] (2:37:42 - 2:37:45)
And again, let's do it right the first time so we don't have to come back.

[Speaker 39] (2:37:45 - 2:37:46)
That's right. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:37:47 - 2:37:51)
Okay, what do we have now. Bottom of page.

[Speaker 39] (2:37:56 - 2:37:56)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:38:00 - 2:38:13)
All right. I know I'm just looking ahead. Okay.

We're going to do. We do one item then we'll go to, we'll do you first. The next item and then we're going to go to all them in Martin.

[Speaker 39] (2:38:14 - 2:38:19)

And the reason why I was going to see one because if the venue didn't work for me I was putting a beauty supply store and a beauty shop.

[Speaker 15] (2:45:01 - 2:45:05)
Okay, so we have arterial alternate plan B.

[Speaker 4] (2:45:06 - 2:45:06)
Yes.

[Speaker 15] (2:45:07 - 2:45:15)
Yes, sir. Okay. Okay.

This is an interesting one Mr Chairman.

[Speaker 4] (2:45:16 - 2:45:24)
And I also do daycare. I'm a, I'm a licensed childcare provider. I've been doing daycare since 2006.

[Speaker 15] (2:45:24 - 2:45:25)
Okay.

[Speaker 39] (2:45:29 - 2:45:36)
This is all right.

[Speaker 1] (2:45:40 - 2:45:43)
All the woman down on this on this application.

[Speaker 12] (2:45:43 - 2:46:02)
Yeah. What is the adjacent. I'm looking at the Google site so I see there's several buildings similar to what you're proposing on that strip.

What's the adjacent zoning for those buildings, you would know, they may affect the resolution.

[Speaker 31] (2:46:03 - 2:46:25)
Yes. So the adjacent, the immediate adjacent building is a church, and then there is a residential building of the residential improvement across the street are some manufacturing buildings that are no longer in operation. This is also where the proposed off the parking is going to be located.

[Speaker 12] (2:46:26 - 2:46:36)
This thing. See one dash one zoning. There's a classifications anywhere on that block.

[Speaker 39] (2:46:37 - 2:46:40)
No, they're all manufacturing or residential.

[Speaker 12] (2:46:44 - 2:46:47)
I agree we have the same issue as.

[Speaker 1] (2:46:47 - 2:47:45)
Okay. All right. So we're going to treat both applications, the same.

We're going to do a little more homework. The C one one is a very liberal zoning. We've mentioned in the previous testimony taverns, if, if your project doesn't work.

We don't, the community has no protection over, you know, the uses that a C one one and they're pretty liberal. So what we're going to do, unless I hear from Alderman Osterman is look at both of these uniformly under the same lens and try to help both of you get what you need to operate your business, and we will hopefully be able to see you at the next meeting, and be able to ultimately pass it the same time so you're not losing any, any time, other than today. And coming back in, but I'll eat I'll entertain.

[Speaker 11] (2:47:47 - 2:48:43)
Alderman Osterman on this one is if zoning could elaborate on what they think would be an appropriate zoning designation, whether it's at this meeting or between now and next month, I think I'd like to know that. And then the other part would be I think if there's other folks that have concerns if there's ways that they could have that address with the business owner prior to next month, because if the business owners put the effort in the work and, you know, that shouldn't be held against. So just, I think I understand there may be concerns but I think if there's folks that want to elaborate on that but I think zoning coming up with a clear, clear understanding of what the business plan is the goals of the business plan and then also what they would think is appropriate that might help the applicant.

[Speaker 1] (2:48:45 - 2:48:46)
Thank you Alderman.

[Speaker 8] (2:48:46 - 2:49:42)
Patrick Patrick Murphy with the Department of Planning. So it probably three different answers Alderman. In order to, for the most appropriate zoning if we're going to transition this towards something that allows for commercial, it should be closer to a B2 that would allow some of the ground floor residential, it would not allow the extent of uses being sought in the C1, but the second part of the answer would be the uses you're seeking could be accommodated under a B3, which is the same answer we gave to the previous applicant.

However, while those would both allow the secondary use that you were contemplating if your first business is not successful. There may be prohibitions through licensing based on other personal services that are within 1000 feet, so that may ultimately trigger special use hearing before the zoning board but that would be something to be decided further down the line. So, a B2 or B3 would be more appropriate based on what's described.

[Speaker 31] (2:49:43 - 2:50:01)
So, So, just as the other use I think the B3 is most appropriate, because there will be live entertainment and dancing on occasion, and that district would cover that activity.

[Speaker 1] (2:50:02 - 2:50:57)
And we will reach out to the Alderman also, or her chief of staff. Yes, and did you talk, by the way, you talked to the Alderman or was there a specific staff person. Ursula have a letter.

Okay, we'll get that. We'll get that. Okay, so bear us.

Unfortunately, another day, and we'll move these two cases right up to the front. December 13 10am. All right, so, all the, all the deal makes the motion for this item date certain December 13 objections to the motion.

Hearing none. We'll see you. Well, somebody needs to appear again unless I don't green you appear on behalf of the applicant.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. All right. We will, we will.

Okay. Thank you.

[Speaker 4] (2:50:57 - 2:50:57)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:50:57 - 2:51:05)
All right. Thanks for coming down in your patience. Staff, we have some work to do on this.

These two, please.

[Speaker 39] (2:51:07 - 2:51:07)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (2:51:09 - 2:51:13)
Bottom, what about Alderman Martin?

[Speaker 39] (2:51:13 - 2:51:14)
That is Alderman Martin.

[Speaker 1] (2:51:14 - 2:51:15)
Where are we on with him?

[Speaker 39] (2:51:15 - 2:51:16)
First page.

[Speaker 1] (2:51:16 - 2:51:17)
Oh, back to page one.

[Speaker 39] (2:51:23 - 2:51:24)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (2:51:24 - 2:51:56)
Let me read it into the record. Over here. We like you in a hot seat.

Look it. I didn't think I liked it. All right.

This is page one, bottom. Number A8782, 47th Ward. Ordinance was referred on July 20th of 2022.

The change request, common address, 1753 West Cornelia. Change request, RT4 residential, two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to an RS3 residential single-unit detached house district.

[Speaker 3] (2:51:56 - 2:53:06)
Alderman Martin. Thank you, Chairman, and good afternoon, colleagues. This is an item that is appearing for the second time in relatively short order before the zoning committee.

I had initially supported a rezoning request to bring it to an RT4 so that an existing structure could add a unit. So to avoid being demolished, the owner wanted to make what was then a duplex, a two-flat with a large third story that had a second story, third story, a single unit, five bedrooms. They wanted to create essentially a two-flat without knocking it down.

So we up-zoned it to RT4 with an understanding that we would be looking to revert the zoning back to RS3 once the building improvements were finished. Those improvements have since completed. So we are now, I'm asking your favorable consideration to back-zone it to an RS3 so that in the event, hopefully in the distant future, that there is a demolition that we can have a more fulsome conversation about what a new building would look like.

[Speaker 1] (2:53:07 - 2:54:22)
Questions for the Alderman? Hearing no more questions, Alderman Osterman makes the motion move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to the motion?

Hearing none, the item is passed. That's it? Oh, we're gonna go to the other one, yeah.

So we are now moving on the last item on page 15. Not the last item, but just not the last item today, but, and then you can move out and let our attorney somewhere close by, I think. All right, I'll read into the record document number 21122, 47th Ward.

Ordinance was referred September 21st of 2022. And the common address is 4651 through 4719, Northwestern Avenue, 2320 through 2332 West Leland and 2323 through 2333 West Leland. The change request from B3-2 Community Shopping District to B3-3 Community Shopping District and then to Residential Business Plan Development.

Mariah Agrino.

[Speaker 7] (2:54:22 - 2:55:00)
Thank you. Thank you, Chairman Tony and members of the committee. My name is Mariah Agrino with the law firm of DLA Piper representing the applicant in this matter, the Community Builders, a not-for-profit organization.

To my right is Will Woodley with the Community Builders. We're also joined by Gabby Dzikiewicz with DesignBridge, the project architect, as well as Sarah Disney Hockey with Sam Schwartz Engineering, the traffic consultant. As a preliminary matter, this application was considered and recommended for approval by the Chicago Plan Commission on November 17th, 2022.

We would ask that the transcript from that hearing be incorporated into the record of today's proceedings.

[Speaker 1] (2:55:01 - 2:55:12)
Alderman Dowell moves to incorporate the records from the Plan Commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the records are incorporated.

Continue, please.

[Speaker 7] (2:55:12 - 2:56:22)
The developer proposes to redevelop the existing surface parking lot located at the northeast corner of Northwestern Avenue and West Leland Avenue with a six-story, 63-unit multifamily development with 36 on-site parking spaces and ground floor commercial space. All of the units in the development will be affordable units. As you noted, the application seeks approval of a zoning change from B3-2 Community Shopping District to B3-3 Community Shopping District, and then to a residential business plan development.

The project team has worked very closely with Alderman Matt Martin, the Department of Housing, the Department of Planning and Development, and numerous community stakeholders and community groups over the last several years. Alderman Martin, Commissioner Navarro, and Commissioner Cox all spoke in support of the project at the Plan Commission hearing, and numerous community members have provided letters of support and spoke at the Plan Commission hearing in support as well. Alderman Matt Martin is here as well to speak to his position regarding the project.

We are available to answer any questions, and thank you for your consideration and ask for your favorable consideration of this project.

[Speaker 1] (2:56:23 - 2:56:46)
All right. Alderman Martin, would you care to opine on this? We do have, I think the committee members got a lot of letters of support.

There were some questions that were asked at the Plan Commission that I'm just reviewing that now, but let the committee members hear from you directly.

[Speaker 3] (2:56:46 - 2:57:59)
Yeah, happy to. Thank you, Chairman, and hello again, committee members. This is currently a city-owned parking lot, and over the last two and a half years, we've had a series of robust community conversations about putting in what you have before you, which is a multi-story, mixed-use, 100% affordable development.

After those meetings and lots of back and forth, we settled on what is before you, which has the support of the three immediately adjacent neighborhood associations, as well as the Chamber of Commerce. With a development like this at a critical intersection, it was very challenging to thread the needle, not just with the community, but with city departments, but at the end, I think we settled on something that our community is very excited about, in particular, activating a very important corner within a broader Lincoln Square commercial corridor that is already very thriving, as well as replenishing a lot of the more affordable housing that we've lost in recent decades due to deconversions and demolitions.

Happy to answer any questions, and would very much appreciate your favorable consideration.

[Speaker 1] (2:58:01 - 2:58:14)
All right. There were also at least two or three public comment period in support of the project. Alderman Osterman, I think, had a hand up.

[Speaker 11] (2:58:14 - 2:58:19)
Questions. One is, what's the unit makeup in the building?

[Speaker 7] (2:58:21 - 2:58:25)
Yeah, Mr. Woodley, if you could please introduce yourself and then answer the question.

[Speaker 9] (2:58:26 - 2:59:24)
Yeah, Will Woodley with the community builders, the developer. The makeup, it's, the makeup is, it's a, the makeup, all right, is, it is all affordable, but it's a range of affordability. So it's 63 apartments, a combination of studios, one bedrooms and two bedrooms, and approximately a third of those apartments are for people making 30% of area medium income.

A third are at 60%, and a third are at 80%, and to sort of translate that. So while every apartment has some income and related rent restriction, the range is from folks making approximately minimum wage up to a household making about $85,000 a year in today's dollars.

[Speaker 11] (2:59:25 - 2:59:31)
The size of the units, the two bedrooms, is that like 25% of the overall development?

[Speaker 9] (2:59:31 - 2:59:41)
No, there are nine two bedrooms, 25, I'm sorry, 29. There's nine two bedrooms, 29 one bedrooms and 25 studios.

[Speaker 11] (2:59:42 - 2:59:55)
And this is more Alderman Martin, the, it's a city parking lot. Is the applicant buying that, or is that the city incorporating that as part of the proposal?

[Speaker 3] (2:59:56 - 3:00:04)
The applicant is purchasing it similar to other proposals that this committee, among others, have approved, including the Emmett Street development and Carlos Rosas Ward.

[Speaker 11] (3:00:05 - 3:00:53)
Okay, just a comment. I wanna commend Alderman Martin and the development team. While Alderman Martin portrays this as kind of a swift community process, I think this has probably not been that way.

It's taken a lot of input from residents, business owners, but at the end of the day, it's gonna be a phenomenal development in his community. But I think it's also, it is what I think you're gonna see more of on the North side, hopefully, 100% affordable development buildings in North side communities where it'll be successful for everybody involved. So I think a lot of work's been put into this.

Just wanna commend you and look forward to seeing this developed and people housed and seeing it thrive. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:00:54 - 3:00:55)
Alderman Womendow.

[Speaker 12] (3:00:57 - 3:01:43)
Yes, I want to echo Alderman Osterman and congratulate Alderman Martin. Good to see some affordable housing going on the North side of the city. So I commend you.

I know that that's not always easy in certain parts of the city. I'm curious to know what kind of amenities are in this building for the residents that are there or that will be moving there. And then if you could just give me a sense of what market rate might be for that area, and then what the rent would be for, just say an 80% AMI occupant, if you could do it for like a two bedroom.

[Speaker 9] (3:01:46 - 3:04:39)
So on the first question for the amenities, this image right here is actually the ground floor that's predominantly commercial. There is one-for-one bike room here, but if you could switch to the rendering, that'll probably give you a better sense. So we do have a resident lounge on the fifth floor that opens up onto a terrace that's along Leland and is gonna be really well positioned for, there are a lot of community events here, and this is a really important corridor.

And this development not only provides affordable housing, but it actually will strengthen that corridor for the entire community. So those are, in terms of, oh, and then we do have onsite parking for residents of approximately 18. We have a package room.

It's certainly, this is not like luxury apartments, but they are very nice. We have, we always build quality apartments with ample storage, a lot of natural light with larger windows, but we also try to be efficient with city funds. And then the other real amenity for this location is for the residents is this location itself.

It's across the street from the CTA Western Station. It is a couple of blocks away from Wells Park, which is a tremendously well-programmed park. And then it's adjacent to one of the strongest small business corridors in the city and is in walking distance to grocery services.

It is a truly exceptional location for the residents. To answer the question on rents, so kind of going back to the other, Alderman Osterman's question, we have a range of rents, depending on different income tiers. The market rate for a brand, for a new two-bedroom in this area, even, and we don't have swimming pools here or anything like that, but still there's no way it's less than 2,500.

No way. New construction. I mean, this is my opinion, but I know this area really well.

No way. In today's numbers, the top rent for a two-bedroom at 80% AMI, which is the highest income level we have, is around 1,950. And again, the 2,500, I'm trying to be conservative of why not going too high, but it's expensive.

Lincoln Square has, because it's such a strong location, rents have gone up, purchase prices have gone way up. So that's where I would kind of, how I would differentiate 80% versus market. And then, the two bedrooms actually from different income ranges will go all the way down to about 1,500.

[Speaker 39] (3:04:40 - 3:04:40)
Thank you.

[Speaker 9] (3:04:42 - 3:04:43)
Other questions?

[Speaker 1] (3:04:45 - 3:06:22)
I'm gonna make a comment, because I did speak on this one. There was a lot of, as Alderman Osterman said, and Alderman Martin attests to, this was a work in progress and a lot of give and take. So kudos to you, Alderman, especially a first term Alderman, and it's a controversial project.

And as you have said previously, compromises has taken place with this. What I got in response to my plan commission questions were, and I think Alderman Osterman asked, this was part of the LAZ parking deal, so to speak, or un-deal, or not a good deal, or whatever. So the land, if I'm not mistaken, was it a dollar purchase on the land?

And then the responsibility for the concession agreement is to find, I'm reading 47 parking spaces. Is that what I'm seeing? Or is that the 47th?

Oh no, 47 replacement parking spaces. The metered spaces in the existing lot are defined as reserve spaces, which means 85% of the revenue goes directly to the city and is not counted toward the parking meter true up. Department of Finance will work with Alderman's office to identify up to 47 replacement parking spaces within the 47th Ward.

If spaces cannot be located in the 47th Ward, the city will need to identify alternative locations or accept the loss in revenue. So everyone's aware of that in that negotiation. Alderman Martin, right?

You're cool with that?

[Speaker 3] (3:06:23 - 3:06:24)
Yes, we're aware and we're comfortable with that.

[Speaker 1] (3:06:26 - 3:07:22)
I know we have Department of Planning here in the case we're needed, right? Yeah, okay. And then the other question, I was personally, I was actually by the site this morning.

Just in, okay, give me one second and I'll get to it. The, you know, the plaza with CTA is not attractive. I mean, and the question I brought in front of the Planning Commission was, is there any kind of way, I think you're on a Zoom, if not there.

So, you know, I get the response, there's SSA, there's, you know, there is a plan, obviously there's gonna be construction, you know, but, you know, I think in terms of Alderman Dowell's questions about amenities is there's nothing better than to, I know how rich that area is, not just in income, but in shopping and the Wells Park, but you've got an opportunity right across the street that seems to be underutilized.

[Speaker 3] (3:07:23 - 3:09:05)
And I did get an answer to that, but Alderman Martin, would you like to? Yeah, I'd be happy to elaborate on that. So right when I got into office, the Lincoln Square Ravenswood Chamber of Commerce was putting the final touches on its master plan for the area, which noted this particular site as one that would be a great candidate for mixed use, but then also said the plaza to south, as you noted, badly needed some improvements.

And so through the leadership of the chamber, working with my office, the community, city departments, including DPD and CDOT, we are putting the finishing touches on a redesign for that plaza. And then as you're moving east to the area underneath the tracks to hopefully reflect, if not mirror the low line, which our two wards share, which was a great addition to our Lakeview community. And then going to east into what is currently a city owned lot that houses the farmer's market in Lincoln Square.

So the chamber has already taken the laboring or with that work. And in addition, as Mr. Woodley noted, you have the Western CTA Brown Line, which is one of the busier ones in our entire system. City council approved an $8 million TIF allocation in July.

And that's gonna be used to leverage $22 million in federal funds. So $30 million in total to completely rehabilitate that station, which is badly needed. And hopefully we'll showcase what is the city's only piece of the Berlin wall, which a lot of folks, even in the area don't currently know exists.

So that whole, those two corners, this project, and then due south with the plaza and the CTA station will be much, much improved after several years of construction.

[Speaker 1] (3:09:05 - 3:09:09)
Great. Alderman Osterman and then Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 11] (3:09:09 - 3:09:23)
Just a quick question. So the CTA station's gonna get $8 million of TIF funds, which they're gonna be able to then use federal money as well to renovate the station. That's right.

Were they involved in conversations about this development at all?

[Speaker 3] (3:09:24 - 3:09:47)
We kept CTA abreast of the issue, but the CTA plans are very much in their infancy. I don't even know that we've had yet our first community meeting, but they, everyone's aware, CDOT, DPD, DOH, CTA about the work that's happening, not just at this critical intersection, but all along the stretch of Western Avenue, starting at Addison, going all the way up to Howard.

[Speaker 11] (3:09:47 - 3:10:19)
I only bring up the question because I think this development here could be a model for equitable transit-orientated development on the south and west sides and all over the city. So I think if those are from planning here- That's an example that predates us. Well, but I think we could do probably another 15 of these elsewhere.

I think planning should talk to the CTA about land that's available and try to get developers that are interested in doing this so that we can have it expand. So, but that's all.

[Speaker 39] (3:10:19 - 3:10:21)
Thanks. Gov. Arnett.

[Speaker 41] (3:10:22 - 3:10:44)
I would be remiss if I did not commend my colleague for being in a unique community where everyone may not be favorable of affordable housing and standing up to make sure that it happened. And he have diversity and equity in his community. So I just want to commend you.

[Speaker 24] (3:10:44 - 3:10:45)
Keep up the good work. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:10:46 - 3:10:50)
Any other questions, comments? Alderman Kaplan, you're not opining on this one.

[Speaker 24] (3:10:51 - 3:11:08)
I am jealous. I'm actually trying to do the exact same thing. And so there's still lots of work, but I love it.

And we need a lot more of this in the entire city, especially the North side where there's lots of gentrification. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:11:08 - 3:11:23)
All right. With that, Alderman Kaplan makes a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, this item is passed as revised. Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 41] (3:11:23 - 3:11:38)
If I can just say, and just so everybody known, Matt Martin stands up for this. And because he stands up, he don't even have an opponent. So everybody should stand up and make these things happen in their ward.

They won't have an opponent. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:11:38 - 3:12:25)
There'll be another challenge tomorrow, Matt. So don't get too confident. All right.

All right, where are we going now? We're back to? All right.

No, no, no, no. We moved out of order for him. Top of page 12 is the deferral?

Yes. Okay. So document number, on top of page 12, document number 21193, 36th Ward, ordinance was referred on October 26th of 2022.

Common address is 2121 North LaPorte. Change request, RS3 residential single unit detached house district to RM4.5 residential multi-unit. Who's asking for the deferral?

Villegas?

[Speaker 24] (3:12:25 - 3:12:26)
Yeah.

[Speaker 1] (3:12:27 - 3:13:07)
Okay. The applicant, David Perez has asked for a deferral. So I need a motion to defer.

That would be by Alderman Capelman. Moves to defer this item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, this item is deferred. Middle of page 12, document number 21186, 37th Ward. Ordinance was referred October 26th of 2022.

Common address is 1830 North Lamone Avenue. Change request, M12 limited manufacturing business park district to M22 light industry district. Rolando Acosta.

[Speaker 27] (3:13:07 - 3:13:44)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant. Hopefully relatively straightforward matter.

This is an existing industrial building that is vacant. The applicant proposes to use it for cannabis, craft grow and infuser facility. And for that purpose, it needs to be rezoned from an M12 to a M22.

It will then have to go through a special use process because it is in proximity to residential within 600 feet. We did have a community meeting. The Alderman held a community meeting at her ward office.

There were no objections to that, to the proposal. And she has provided a letter of support.

[Speaker 1] (3:13:44 - 3:14:27)
We do have a letter of support from Alderwoman Mitts. Pretty straightforward. Questions, comments?

Alderman Capelman makes a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, this item is passed.

Thank you. You're still with us on document number 21187-T1, 40th Ward. Ordinance was referred October 26th of 2022.

Common address is 5113 through 5115 North Lincoln Avenue in the change request from B31 Community Shopping District to B23 Neighborhood Mixed Use District. Again, Rolando Acosta on this item.

[Speaker 27] (3:14:28 - 3:15:15)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Rolando Acosta on behalf of the applicant. This involves a parcel of property at Carmen and Lincoln.

It is just south of Carmen on Lincoln Avenue. It is currently improved with two one-story buildings that are underutilized. They appear to, well, they're not really open.

They're not vacant, but there's no activity out of these buildings. The proposal is to demolish the two existing buildings, construct a four-story building containing nine units on the upper floors, three units per floor on floors two, three, and four, ground floor commercial with parking to the rear of the property. Again, we held a community meeting on this property.

The alderman did, and no one attended. No one has any objection, has stated any objections to this proposal, and a letter of support has been provided by the alderman.

[Speaker 1] (3:15:15 - 3:15:57)
We have received a letter of support from Alderman Vasquez. Any questions, comments from committee members? Hearing none, Alderman Burnett makes a motion move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed. Top of page 13, document number 21184, 41st Ward.

Ordinance was deferred October 26th of 2022. This common address, 6008 through 6016, North Northwest Highway. Change request, C11, Neighborhood Commercial District to C21, Motor-Vehicle-Related Commercial District.

Again, we have Rolando Acosta on this item in 41.

[Speaker 27] (3:15:59 - 3:16:42)
Once again, Mr. Chairman, Rolando Acosta, on behalf of the applicant, the subject property is approved with the building. It contains about 12,600 square feet. It is part of the business.

There's multiple businesses in the building. There is a flooring company. There is a beauty parlor, but there's also a storage of U-Haul trucks, outdoor storage of U-Haul trucks.

It's existed for a number of years, but apparently is not permitted by the zoning. During COVID, the licenses lapsed. So we are trying to change the zoning to a C2 to allow that outdoor storage.

We had a meeting with the 41st Ward Zoning Advisory Committee, which unanimously recommended approval of this. And as a result, the alderman has provided a letter of support.

[Speaker 1] (3:16:43 - 3:16:52)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Napolitano. Just a quick question. Are we reverting this?

[Speaker 27] (3:16:53 - 3:17:01)
The commitment was that we would revert it, assuming that nothing, it does not impair his licenses in any way.

[Speaker 1] (3:17:01 - 3:17:06)
Okay. Okay. Well, that's up to the alderman, but the C2 has some other uses.

[Speaker 27] (3:17:07 - 3:17:08)
Well aware of it.

[Speaker 1] (3:17:08 - 3:17:08)
Surprise.

[Speaker 27] (3:17:08 - 3:17:13)
And we committed to the alderman that if he wished it to be reverted, we would agree.

[Speaker 1] (3:17:14 - 3:17:28)
With that, any other questions, comments? Can I get a motion to move to pass by Alderman Capelman on that item? By the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

[Speaker 27] (3:17:28 - 3:17:28)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:17:29 - 3:18:16)
All right. Bottom of page 13, document number 21195-T1 in the 46th Ward. Ordinance referred October 26th of 2022.

Common address 1106 West Lawrence Avenue. Also 4800 through 4822 North Winthrop Avenue. Change request RT4, residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district to B35 community shopping district.

And then what is that? Oh, I'm sorry. The current zoning, RT4 and B35, all will change to a B33 community shopping district.

Sorry about that. Okay. Steven Gray.

I represent- You speak into the mic, Steve. Sorry.

[Speaker 40] (3:18:17 - 3:19:43)
Steven Gray, I represent the owner of the Aragon Ballroom on 1106 West Lawrence. As you know, the ballroom is located within a historic landmark district. And it has been discovered recently that the back lot, which is right in back of the ballroom has been zoned residential.

And that parking lot is used by the employees and members of the ballroom and vendor services. So at the recommendation of the Bureau of Zoning, we wanted to correct the parking lot designation and then correct the designation of the ballroom and the parking lot into one unified district. So there's no change to the use.

There's no building that's intended simply continuing the use that has been probably on the books for decades. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (3:19:44 - 3:19:48)
So I'm assuming the 4800 through 4822, is that the R?

[Speaker 24] (3:19:49 - 3:19:51)
That's the parking lot, yeah. Yeah. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (3:19:52 - 3:19:53)
Alderman Kappelman.

[Speaker 24] (3:19:55 - 3:20:09)
This is the venue that my favorite president of all time celebrated his 50th birthday, Barack Obama. It's just a very simple matter. So I fully, fully support this.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:20:09 - 3:21:07)
All right, questions for the Alderman, applicant? Hearing none, Alderman Burnett moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, the item is passed. All right. We went, let's see, middle of page 14, document number 21131, 32nd Ward.

Ordinance was referred on September 21st of 2022. Common address is 2501 North Elston. The change request, Waterway Business Plan Development number 1222 to C33 Commercial Manufacturing and Employment District, and then to Waterway Business Plan Development number 1222 as amended.

And we have the- You have the dream team. I was gonna say. Father, daughter.

No. No. I'm only kidding.

It's a long meeting. All right, Mariah.

[Speaker 7] (3:21:08 - 3:21:40)
Thank you. Mariah Degrino with CLA Piper. I would ask that this matter be considered sort of as a joint presentation with the next matter on the agenda, which is matter number 21048, also in the 32nd Ward, which is an application submitted by the Tennis Corporation of America represented by Jack George to my left.

The matters pertain to the boundary change, which I will pass the mic to Mr. George to let him discuss these.

[Speaker 1] (3:21:40 - 3:21:48)
So what we will do is we will hear both of these, and I'll have to take a motion for each one separately, but it's one presentation.

[Speaker 7] (3:21:48 - 3:21:49)
Correct.

[Speaker 1] (3:21:49 - 3:21:51)
Okay. Mr. George.

[Speaker 28] (3:21:52 - 3:23:02)
The PD amendment, as Mariah just indicated, my name is Jack George. I'm an attorney with offices at 71 South Wacker, Chicago. The PD amendment, as Mariah indicated, works in conjunction with application 211314, Delta Real Estate Holdings, LLC.

The applicant, Midtown, purchased a parcel of property from its neighbor, Delta Real Estate Holdings, which is located in PD 1222. Delta Real Estate Holdings filed, and you just heard a companion case to this where Delta Real Estate is removing a portion of property from their boundaries of 1222 and rezoning it to C33 commercial manufacturing. My client, Tennis Corporation Midtown, is now seeking to add that parcel into our boundary, which our PD, which is 1238.

This matter was heard by the plan commission on November the 17th, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, and Mariah and I would both ask that the report of proceedings and exhibits that were part of the proceedings before the plan commission be incorporated into and made a part of the proceedings before your committee today.

[Speaker 1] (3:23:03 - 3:23:40)
All right. Well, let's start with 21131, which is the PD 1222. We're gonna, Alderman Kaplan moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, that item is incorporated. And let's just procedurally, since we haven't introduced the other one, let's just keep going, knowing that we as committee members know this is actually one piece, one development.

[Speaker 7] (3:23:42 - 3:24:25)
Certainly. So as Mr. George described, Midtown purchased the sliver, we'll call it the sliver of property shown in green on the screen here. That piece is currently part of what we call the Fox Ford dealership PD, which is PD 1222.

The application to amend PD 1222 would remove that green piece from 1222, rezone it to a base commercial designation C3-3, which is consistent with the underlying designation for PD 1238. And then the remainder of the Fox Ford dealership PD 1222 would remain in PD 1222. And then we would then transition to Mr. George's application for Midtown to incorporate it into that.

[Speaker 1] (3:24:25 - 3:26:14)
All right, so let's do a quick vote on that. So what we're doing is that green area is moved out of 1222, and it's gonna be in the next application as part of the Midtown expansion. Correct.

Okay, so understand. So Alderman Capelman makes a motion move to pass by the quorum call, any objections to that? Hearing none, that item is passed.

Now, I'm sorry, it's passed as revised, correct? Okay, so now we're on to document number 21048 in the 32nd ward. Common address is 2416 through 2520 North Elston, 2000 through 2050 West Fullerton, 2425 through 2455 North Elston, 2418 through 2518 North Damon, and 2463 to 2497 North Levitt.

Change request from, as we said, the plan development number 1222, then C33 commercial manufacturing and employment district, and then to plan development number 1238 as amended. Okay, so we're adding that chunk, that triangle there in the corner, and we are taking it out of 1222, and now we are inserting it in to 1238. And that's an amendment of that particular PD.

So we'll start with the incorporation of the records from the plan commission by Alderman Kappelman moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that? Hearing none, those records are incorporated.

[Speaker 28] (3:26:16 - 3:26:44)
Mr. Chairman. What we're doing, as Mariah just indicated a little while ago, and you just said, what we're doing is we're taking out the area that's outlined in green on the slides that are above you there and behind us, and taking that piece of property and moving it from 1222 into 1238. All the landscaping and other requirements that are done required by the city of Chicago are being complied with, and we would ask for a favorable recommendation that that be accomplished.

[Speaker 1] (3:26:45 - 3:26:58)
All right. I did entertain this at the plan commission, familiar with the property, at least the Ford property. What are the plans for this site?

[Speaker 28] (3:26:58 - 3:27:09)
We don't really have a plan yet. We don't really have a plan for it yet, Mr. Chairman. It's just being brought into our PD, and then we will, and they're working on plans as to whatever they're going to do there.

[Speaker 1] (3:27:11 - 3:27:15)
And is there a building on the site already?

[Speaker 28] (3:27:16 - 3:27:17)
On this site?

[Speaker 1] (3:27:17 - 3:27:23)
No, not on the piece of property we're bringing in. No, no, but the corner. You have something at the corner there.

[Speaker 28] (3:27:24 - 3:27:31)
Which corner? Right in the corner, yeah, we do. There's an athletic facility right in the corner there.

[Speaker 1] (3:27:31 - 3:27:33)
Is it connected to Midtown?

[Speaker 28] (3:27:33 - 3:27:34)
Yeah, it's part of Midtown.

[Speaker 1] (3:27:34 - 3:27:35)
Okay, I'm not a member there.

[Speaker 28] (3:27:35 - 3:27:37)
No, no, no, it is.

[Speaker 1] (3:27:37 - 3:27:47)
I could afford it, but I don't want to. I can't afford the trip going over there, actually. It's too much congestion.

Right. Okay. Yeah, well, it's amazing what they're doing over there.

[Speaker 28] (3:27:48 - 3:27:51)
It really is, and the new hotel has been a real success.

[Speaker 1] (3:27:52 - 3:27:53)
Well, it's just a campus in and of itself.

[Speaker 28] (3:27:54 - 3:27:55)
Yeah, it's been a great success.

[Speaker 1] (3:27:55 - 3:27:59)
We've had many trips to the Planning Commission on these projects.

[Speaker 28] (3:27:59 - 3:28:09)
Yeah, over the years, there's been a lot of them. But the hotel, I had an opportunity to go to the hotel and see what goes on over there, and it's remarkable for the community.

[Speaker 1] (3:28:09 - 3:28:36)
Yeah, and it's making the other clubs put to shame. All right, any other questions, comments on this one? Hearing none, Alderman Burnett moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, this item is gonna be passed as revised also. Okay, all right.

[Speaker 28] (3:28:37 - 3:28:38)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee.

[Speaker 1] (3:28:39 - 3:28:42)
And now we are on our final item, I think.

[Speaker 39] (3:28:42 - 3:28:42)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (3:28:44 - 3:29:08)
All right, well, Ed knows the rules around here too, so it's not like... We'll read document number 21130 in the 42nd ward. Ordinance was referred on September 21st of 2022.

Common address is 369 West Grand. Change request, plan development number 1428 to plan development number 1428 as amended with Ed Kuss as the attorney on this application. Ed.

[Speaker 23] (3:29:08 - 3:29:36)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon, Chairman Toney and members of the committee. My name is Ed Kuss, an attorney at Taft, located at 111 East Wacker in Chicago.

I appear this morning on behalf of the applicant on a group limited partnership. Joining me this afternoon and sitting to my right is Mr. Paul Puro, the senior development manager with Ani. I would ask, first of all, that the record of proceedings from November 17th, 2022 plan commission be incorporated into today's hearing.

[Speaker 1] (3:29:37 - 3:29:46)
Alderman Kaplan moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the records are in front of us.

[Speaker 23] (3:29:47 - 3:30:58)
Thank you. This is a technical amendments to plan development number 1428, which was approved by the city council in October, 2018. Plan development number 1428 is located at 369 West Grand and consists of a high rise residential building with 356 dwelling units, 253 parking spaces and ground floor commercial space.

This amendment was filed on September 21st, 2022. The sole purpose of the amendment is to add daycare as a permitted use and that daycare will be located on the ground floor. The exterior of the building is not changing, nor are any of the other development parameters.

For your information, the daycare will be operated by Montessori. There will initially be approximately 124 children, ages three to six. Maximum capacity will be 150 children over the years.

There'll be 19 staff members on site. Melvin Riley has sponsored an ordinance to provide for a loading zone on Grand Avenue outside of the building where drop off and pickups. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, that is all. We would ask for your favorable consideration and we are available to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (3:30:59 - 3:31:05)
Ed, thank you for your patience and would you identify yourself for the record?

[Speaker 29] (3:31:07 - 3:31:08)
Paul Giroir with Donny Group.

[Speaker 1] (3:31:09 - 3:31:10)
I'm sorry, say it again.

[Speaker 29] (3:31:10 - 3:31:12)
Paul Giroir with Donny Group.

[Speaker 1] (3:31:12 - 3:31:17)
So Paul, what is your role here? Are you the operator of this daycare?

[Speaker 29] (3:31:18 - 3:31:29)
No, I'm on the development team for the project and I helped with the construction of the whole development itself, but Montessori will be operating the daycare. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (3:31:31 - 3:31:36)
And again, Ed, what was the number of units actually in this plan of development?

[Speaker 23] (3:31:37 - 3:31:37)
356.

[Speaker 1] (3:31:38 - 3:31:41)
Plenty of people upstairs. Plenty of people upstairs is right, yeah.

[Speaker 23] (3:31:41 - 3:31:49)
Unfortunately, the ground floor has been vacant the last couple of years and fortunately, Montessori is coming in and they're gonna take almost 100% of the ground floor space.

[Speaker 1] (3:31:50 - 3:31:53)
And I'm sorry, what is the square footage of the?

[Speaker 23] (3:31:53 - 3:31:54)
10,700.

[Speaker 1] (3:31:56 - 3:32:00)
All right, well, sounds like a good use. How old is the building itself?

[Speaker 29] (3:32:01 - 3:32:06)
We got first occupancy, 2020 January.

[Speaker 1] (3:32:07 - 3:33:33)
A lot's happened since 2020. All right, any other questions, comments? Alderman Capelman moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed as revised and I think that concludes our meeting. Alderman Capelman moves to adjourn.

Objections? Hearing none, this meeting is adjourned. Okay, thanks and thank you for your patience.

So. Thank you very much.
