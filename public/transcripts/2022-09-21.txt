And Alderman Kappelman is present. All right so the only remaining item is 0 2 0 2 2 1838 relating to an amendment of plan development at 1201 through 1285 West Cabrini Street. The committee voted on and did not pass this ordinance earlier in the meeting yesterday.

It has come up it's come to my attention that we received additional letters of support from the ABLA Local Advisory Council and the Central Advisory Council that was a request I believe of David Moore yesterday. In light of this new information the committee may wish to reconsider the vote. Can I get a motion to reconsider the committee's vote on ordinance 0 2 0 2 2.

[Speaker 4] (10:10 - 10:13)
So moved Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (10:14 - 10:46)
Hold on let me just say before we get it be clear a yes vote is a vote to place this item before the committee for further consideration. Point of information chairman. All right on the point Raymond.

Thank you chairman. Can you please tell me who voted for and who voted against this yesterday? Well that's that's a that was reported out yesterday we had seven seven in the negative and five in the affirmative.

[Speaker 2] (10:47 - 10:52)
So only somebody who voted in in the negative will be able to make the motion.

[Speaker 1] (10:52 - 11:10)
Right in terms of the point of information a person who voted against is not an absentee person or a person who voted in the affirmative. The person who voted in the negative is a person who was asked to be reconsidered. So can I get a motion to reconsider please?

[Speaker 4] (11:10 - 11:12)
So moved by Alderman Cardona.

[Speaker 1] (11:12 - 11:21)
Alderman Cardona and just for the record Alderman Cardona yesterday you voted in opposition to this today you're asking us to reconsider.

All right and I didn't hear from Alderwoman Hadden. All right so there are there there are nine ayes and five nays. Alderman Cardona's motion to reconsider the vote passes with the motion to reconsider past ordinance 02022-1838 is now before us.

So we passed it and the vote again. Vote is what? Okay the motion reconsider is passed.

I wrote right then into the record. All right so the ordinance now is before us. We're going to do the roll call again.

So voting yes is to support this recommend to support the facility that we've been talking about. So yes is in support. Obviously no you're opposed to it.

Sorry. All right we'll start with the roll call.

[Speaker 2] (15:05 - 15:06)
My hand is still raised Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (15:07 - 15:11)
Okay I'm sorry. Okay let's Alderman Beall.

[Speaker 2] (15:12 - 15:42)
Thank you my virtual hand is a little tired. It's been raised since the beginning of the week. So thank you Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman I just wanted to state for the record that I have never seen a roll call vote that was taken in committee and was voted down and then because we don't like the outcome of the vote we reconvene to have another vote the very next day. Okay that has never been done. Let me can I finish Mr. Chairman?

[Speaker 1] (15:42 - 15:43)
Yes sir.

[Speaker 2] (15:43 - 16:29)
Just let me let me just finish. Yes sir. Our rules state that anything that is voted up or down it is the responsibility of the chair to report out whatever it is the next following day or the next committee meeting or I mean at the next City Council meeting.

Not to you know reconvene and you know change the will or the wishes of the committee. And so I've never seen a vote to be reconsidered in committee even since we've been in virtual. I've never seen it and this is a president's and this is something very new to this committee.

And so Mr. Chairman I think we are totally out of order. I think our we're skirting our rules and regulations once again and you know I think that we need to reconsider this. So thank you Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (16:29 - 16:46)
Thank you. With with all due respect I'm going to ask Redatu to refer to the rules about this issue. This is not the first time we've reconsidered.

The committee is in recess has been called back to recess. Redatu would you like to comment on this?

[Speaker 3] (16:47 - 18:13)
Yes chair chairman. Yeah this is in accordance with by the way just for the sake of the record my name is Redi Itokasa. I'm chief assistant corporation counsel in the city's law department.

And the procedure just undertaken by the committee is pursuant to rule 34 of the rules of order in the procedure of the the city council. And under that rule and the rule 34 any vote any vote can be reconsidered at the same meeting or at the next regular meeting. This meeting is the continuation of the meeting from yesterday.

So it is the same meeting as the one which started yesterday. So a motion to reconsideration is proper and the motion is made by person who voted on the prevailing side. Sorry an elder man who voted on the prevailing side.

So procedurally this is right and that this is in accordance with the city's the city council's rules and procedures. Also speaking of precedent I think even this month in the committee of ideation the same procedure was applied to reconsider a committee of both and to bring it before the committee again for a vote. So there is precedent as well.

[Speaker 1] (18:21 - 18:41)
All right so with that Alderman Cardona makes a motion to pass this ordinance 0 2 0 2 2 by 1838 by the same roll call that was taken to reconsider the item. Alderman Cardona makes the motion. Any objection to the motion?

[Speaker 4] (18:44 - 18:46)
Chairman this is Alderman Hatton.

[Speaker 1] (18:52 - 19:21)
Yes. So not by roll but by the reconsideration motion? Correct.

All right. Hearing no objection so ordered. The do pass recommendation of this ordinance will be reported out later today at the City Council meeting.

There being no further business before the committee can I get a motion to adjourn?

[Speaker 4] (19:21 - 19:22)
So moved Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (19:23 - 19:33)
Alderman Alderwoman Terry Austin makes the motion. Hearing no objection so ordered. We'll see you in the council.

Thank you.
