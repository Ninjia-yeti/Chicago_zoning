[Speaker 17] (25:46 - 28:15)
We're good. All right Good morning, chairman. Good morning committee members.

My name is max line I'm a city planner with the Department of Planning and Development. I'm joined today by Alderman Burnett and Alderman C Joe Lopez who together are asking for your approval of a pedestrian Street designation to stretch of West Madison Street so this comes from a Community group that we had Approached the Department of Planning and Development and request a study to be performed on a particular stretch of West Madison Street As you can see on the screen here the stretch that was Inevitably surveyed by the Department of Planning and Development are outlined in red Those are all the different parcels on this particular stretch of Madison this stretch that was surveyed was from the I-90 Kennedy Expressway all the way west to Ogden Avenue and as you may be familiar with pedestrian Street designation is generally reserved for Stretches of streets that we as a planning department and as a city feel are Have at least a minimum level of criteria for a pedestrian oriented shopping district and for example Recent pedestrian Street designations that have occurred in the area already were to the north Randolph Street and Fulton Market So those were already showing extensive signs of being As I mentioned pedestrian oriented neighborhood shopping districts and the WCA the West Central Association that approached the Department of Planning and inevitably both aldermen Suggested that this stretch of Madison contained Existing criteria that fit our zoning designation criteria already. So we went out and performed a study we Analyzed all of these different parcels to see how they stand today how they exist today and What kind of potential development can exist in the future?

and We've established that the best Conduit for this designation would be the stretch between Halstead and Troop, which is already showing extensive signs of such neighborhood oriented business district criteria and We're asking for approval of the pedestrian Street designation for this stretch between Troop and Halstead Thank you, Max.

[Speaker 1] (28:15 - 28:23)
All right Before we get to Alderman Burnett, I see Alderman Riley Recognized for quorum Brendan or do you have a question?

[Speaker 28] (28:25 - 28:33)

[Speaker 2] (28:38 - 30:19)
Alderman Burnett Yeah, thank you. Mr. Chairman. So as you can see, this is the old map And So a lot of this is going to be Won't be in my ward anymore But we we support this we support the West Central Association matter of fact we actually had a We had proposals to come before us to see how we would spend some of our neighborhood opportunity funds in this area and They had three things that community asked for and one of the things that they wanted Money spent on was to do sort of like a street skate On Madison Street and also to do this What was being proposed right now? And it was over Overwhelmingly supported by the community this was the first at the most votes and I supported 100% and You know, it's interesting how things have evolved over in this area where? more attention gets on the full market area where Madison is probably the most used Use traffic was in the city of Chicago, especially going back and forth through the United Center and and it's very diverse and there needs to be enhanced and Nurtured and and so we support the West Central Association and all of the residents and businesses in this area

[Speaker 1] (30:20 - 31:01)
Thank You alderman alderman Raymond Lopez Recognized for quorum Raymond or you have a question.

That's for sure How about getting back to Alderman Riley, please Thank You chairman.

[Speaker 28] (31:02 - 31:54)
I just had a question about What this where will this be in the new map I Figure some of this is in the new 34th Ward. Is that is that correct? That's a very good question alderman while I look that up feel free to ask away any other questions you got Well, that's that's really my primary question and certainly the fact that there is broad consensus in the community is Encouraging and so I'm not questioning this.

It sounds like a good plan I just was curious to know how much of this will end up in that new ward and obviously there'll be a new alderman coming into office here in just a couple months and so I just wanted to understand if If this would be primarily in that new ward or we're not All right.

[Speaker 1] (31:54 - 31:58)

All right, so we have Brian O'Donnell First from the Department of Housing to talk about program of single-family homes That I know this committee has seen in various parts of the west side to date.

So

[Speaker 16] (36:25 - 36:26)
Take it away Brian

[Speaker 13] (36:29 - 36:38)
Good morning, Chairman Tunney and vice chair of lawyers and committee members for the record My name is Brian O'Donnell with the Homeownership Bureau in the Department of Housing

[Speaker 1] (36:38 - 36:40)
Brian you speak up a little bit, sir

[Speaker 13] (36:40 - 39:59)
Sure I am present this morning to provide testimony in support of alderman Burnett's request to rezone several lots in the hobo park community area in the 27th Ward from RT 4 to RS 3 Tim Swanson of Inherit Homes is also online this morning as an attendee This slide list of lots before the committee this morning for rezoning from RT 4 to RS 3 All of them are currently city-owned Except for a 611 North Lawndale, which Inherit Homes purchased from the Cook County Land Bank last summer The lots are tightly clustered in an area around the lower Ward Elementary School, which is at the corner of Lawndale and Huron Lower Ward Village a city lots for working families development Sponsored by the Department of Housing and approved by City Council last October Is to be constructed in three phases, although the phases will be somewhat different due to the zoning change requests four of the lots and what was to be phase two will now be part of phase one as Rezoning of those lots was approved by this committee last month If you look at what was to be the original phase one the northern most in the parcel that's three three parcels south of it which are Indicated with red arrows. I already have homes one fully complete and one currently being finished on site on The lots that Inherit purchased from the Cook County Land Bank These homes received building permits before the ETOD ordinance was approved by City Council last summer As you can see from the city's zoning map the rezoning of the four lots approved by the committee last month is now in effect The request before you would allow Inherit Homes to build single-family homes as planned for more than two years Unlots purchased from the city in the Cook County Land Bank It should be noted that RS3 zoning also allows for two phase Inherit Homes is a startup company It is also an L3C a type of corporation that is best described as a hybrid between an LLC and a not-for-profit an L3C must provide an important social benefit and 2022 Inherit built out factory space in the 24th Ward at 4647 West Polk to construct your proposed single-family modular homes The rezoning is being requested because the ETOD ordinance approved by a City Council last July Does not allow single-family homes to be built on lots with RT4 zoning in community preservation areas Should the requested zoning changes be approved this morning? This slide shows the variety of homes that Inherit will build on the long vacant parcels The city has zoned these lots for an average of 22.85 years with the range being from 12 to 43 years.

[Speaker 16] (40:01 - 40:03)
That concludes my testimony.

[Speaker 1] (40:06 - 40:16)
Thank you, Brian Alderman Burnett would you like to Speak on these applications, sir Sure, so Brian pretty much Laid it out.

[Speaker 2] (40:16 - 41:39)
This is only because of the adverse effect of the new ETOD That don't allow for single-family homes to be built in this area Or R4 so we have to rezone it to our R3 Before the ETOD was put in it wouldn't have been a problem of just building them So this is one of the adverse effects that's caused by this but these are all affordable homes great organization These are modular homes actually that are being built. We're filling in vacant lots in the West Humboldt Park community trying to balance out the The gentrification that's going on in the area with affordability Houses are starting to sell for 700,000 in this area. So these homes would be in the twos and threes So this is a great a great thing.

It's a Christian Motivated organization that's doing it The the developer is actually an architect for big developments who chose to do affordable housing, so We support this and we ask for the committee's support Thank You Walter.

[Speaker 1] (41:40 - 41:47)
I Know it's a zoning issue. We were We're discussing. Do we have a developer on the call?

[Speaker 31] (41:50 - 41:50)

Um, so this project relates to north side college prep On the north side of the city in the 40th ward as you mentioned This was an existing plan development pd666 as you mentioned What we're doing here is is very simple We are adding a new Turf athletic field. Oh and let me let me preface all this by saying we went to the plan commission previously last week um for this project the plan commission, of course, you know reviewed and and uh Issued a recommendation for this project and it included a substitute ordinance That substitute was just technical in nature We cleaned up some typos, but I would ask that all the records and findings of the plan commission be incorporated Into the records today and that we move forward based on the substitute

[Speaker 1] (1:48:50 - 1:49:02)
Alderman wagus back moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission for the same roll call as you determine quorum any objections Hearing none, uh, the records are incorporated and Please proceed.

[Speaker 5] (1:49:02 - 1:50:15)
Thank you. So again, this is a real straightforward project. We're doing a new turf field here for the school And in order to do it to fit in the field the regulation size and to add some bleachers We needed to add about 15 feet of land on the eastern edge of the campus in the southeastern edge Along the north channel that of course expanded our boundaries of our pd And it also that little strip of land was zoned r1.

So what we did is we Did a what we call a two-step we rezone the r1 to an r2 which was consistent with the rest of the campus And then, you know brought it all back to within Ipd number six six six So, um, that's the technical aspect of what we've done Um, you should have a letter of support from alderman vasquez because I don't believe I saw him on the call i'm joined by again, evan smith on behalf of cps and also our project architect jeff, uh trust who can go through the plans if you'd like um You know relative to the project in the interest of time.

Thank you The property is bound by evergreen on the north elston on the east potomac on the south and the kennedy expressway and metro tracks on the west In 2019 the applicant fully remodeled the existing six-story building in accordance with the north branch corridor overlay district into a class a office building Since the renovation was completed applicant has leased approximately 45 percent of the building to various office tenants But has not found additional office tenants yet to fill the remaining space Recently Applicant has been approached by a growing number of tenants who would be a good fit for the existing building But which are not allowed uses in the building such as a dentist office and a dance studio Neither of which are allowed uses in the m3-3 zoning classification So as a result applicant is seeking to amend the zoning to c2-3 Which will allow for these users to be able to locate in the building There are absolutely no changes or modifications to the building that are being proposed Rather this zoning change is strictly to allow additional users, uh to use the existing building community benefits from this application include continued investment by the applicant in the existing building and Increased jobs for the community as a result of expanded uses allowed in the building Applicant is also required to pay a fee of three hundred seventy two thousand nine hundred two dollars and twenty five cents Into the industrial corridor system as a result of the zoning change We first met with alderman burnett about this project in december 2022 and shortly thereafter had a meeting with the local community group north branch works To discuss the proposed expansion of uses in the building and the necessary zoning change North branch works subsequently issued a letter of support for the zoning change We also hosted an all community meeting on february 15th, 2023 and did not receive any objections to the application Um alderman burnett attended that meeting with us and I would like to thank alderman burnett for working with us on this project And I believe he is here and likely would like to speak on this himself So thank you very much on behalf of my client. I respectfully request your favorable recommendation and i'm happy to answer any questions That you may have Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:57:44 - 1:57:44)
Kate.

[Speaker 2] (1:57:45 - 2:00:06)
Um alderman burnett Yeah, thank you. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee as the council has said Uh, this is a type one zoning They're just trying to uh allow for a dentist and some other uh groups to come inside the building Also to be able to utilize some of the outdoor space for a restaurant that wants to do a outdoor cafe uh, so this is a very interesting, uh, and This it was unsolicited to me by the developer um but I it's kind of Unfair to me That they rezone this property because they're rezoning the property just to allow for people to utilize the spaces inside the building That they still gotta pay the industrial fee of three hundred and something thousand dollars And they're not building a new building and not tearing up the ground They're just trying to move a dentist and some other folks in their area and they have to spend all that money just to move tenants in the area the current building actually has Uh the women's bank, uh in the building and the engineering company In the building and they're trying to move a dental place in there And also they have a restaurant that because of the current zoning the restaurant can't do an outdoor cafe, which is crazy Uh, so to rezone it, uh, they have to pay Uh industrial fee, uh, and like I said, that's unsolicited by the developer, but I still feel That it's unfair Uh, the north branch work support this also, um, we had a community meeting and So a couple of the neighbors came and they supported also And um, I asked for the committee support on this, but I just want to I said it at the meeting Uh about the that I thought it was unfair that they had to pay the industrial fee when they're not doing a real redevelopment Uh, and and I hope that the planning would look at this for future Developments if they're not going to change the building or do a new development That they're you know, really it's going to take them a minute to even make their money back on that even with the tenants that they're going to have so Um, so I just wanted to mention that uh, so I asked for the committee support.

[Speaker 1] (2:00:06 - 2:00:20)
Thank you Well said, um alderman burnett, uh patrick murphy on this patrick Yeah, sorry chairman.

[Speaker 21] (2:00:21 - 2:01:41)
Um I I just wanted to just to respond to to all remember that's comments regarding the the feet When the department and uh in city council restructured the north branch Uh back in 2017 It was designed specifically to help transition those land though that property from historical industrial uses to more commercial and non-manufacturing uses and even though there are No proposals at this time to add more floor area to this building There are specifically delineated uses that can't be done in the manufacturing zone that pate's client is looking to do in their new property And the structure of those conversions was intentional that as properties convert to allow less manufacturing use There is a fee structure that the city is imposing on those properties So that properties that are now no longer going to be manufacturing Can contribute to the manufacturing health of other industrial corridors in the city? So while I understand the alderman's position about there's no new floor area being added There is a significant unlocking of allowed uses on this property and that was what the fee structure is designed specifically to help Offset expenses in other industrial corridors that are more vital From a manufacturing standpoint while this one's transitioning to less manufacturing

[Speaker 1] (2:01:42 - 2:02:00)
Thank you for that rebuttal on that, um, I don't think alderman burnett's changed his mind but um, I I appreciate The uh the answer Walter did you have something? I just want oh, sorry No, no.

[Speaker 21] (2:02:00 - 2:02:01)
Thank you. Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:02:01 - 2:02:56)
All right patrick in closing I just wanted the committee to know the the backstory behind why the fee is still applicable even though there's no floor area being added Thank you All right, any other questions comments if not Um alderman wogsbeck makes a motion move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum any objections Hearing none this item is passed as revised All right. Thank you very much. Let's see if we can go back to see if mr.

Well, that's true Oh, well, he just he we just steve just sold it to another dealer and that man is is now, uh, becoming very much involved in the community and when he went to uh When he got a notice right after he acquired it that this one lot on thorndale was not in compliance with the zoning and so that's why My client steve napleton who still owns the property then made application for this and Uh, and when we did this, um, there was some question as to some improvements being made along western avenue and so what we did was as part of this is we're we're removing the uh, the turn the Right in and right out off of western avenue and also we're putting up an additional Six foot wooden fence on the southern edge of the property and then landscaping along thorndale Uh, and because this is we had a meeting with the dpd department And they wanted us to do that.

So we've agreed to do that But i've but mr. Patrick murphy I know has i've talked to him and and they're in support of this change in the zoning to accommodate this use All right.

Mr. Chairman, uh members of the committee This is andrew scott with the law offices of dykema gossett and here on behalf of the applicant 1856 w chicago llc This is a pretty straightforward rezoning. It's an existing four-story building commercial on the ground floor There are 12 dwelling units, uh above the ground floor commercial and retail Uh, but when the applicant bought the property city records only indicated that 10 Uh of those lots i'm sorry 10 of those dwelling units were legal And so they are simply trying to rezone the property to get the minimum lot area to get the 12 The additional two units legalized, uh, and so that they can rehab Those units and rent them out. So that's the reason we're rezoning it from b32 to b33 No other changes to the exterior of their building are proposed.

It is part of the city's invest southwest initiative The b32 vacant site is thirty four thousand five hundred and eighteen square feet And as you can see it is used for surface parking the applicant's proposal. Next slide, please here Yeah, thank you The applicant's proposal is to construct a new 100 affordable mixed-use residential building The nine-story building will contain 85 units of affordable housing ranging from one bedroom to four bedrooms A chicago public chicago public library is planned for the first floor There'll be a community room that opens to a public plaza that will be between the pioneer bank and this new building That will be an outdoor marketplace and also be available for community events There'll be a counseling center for the humble park health center on the fourth floor The third floor of the building will contain 58 parking spaces and there will be 13 surface parking spaces along The library and for building use the total cost is estimated to be 55 million dollars The development team estimates the proposal will generate 450 Temporary construction jobs and the creation of 20 permanent jobs.

The applicant is committed to achieving the goals of 26 percent mbe participation Six percent wbe participation as well as the local hiring requirement of 50 residents The applicant has had numerous meetings with community groups who support the project You have a very strong letter of support from alderman maldonado We've met with the departments of planning and housing and we received their approval As well as the office of disability cdot and fire prevention Juan moreno the architect and matt mosher from park road development are here if there are any questions On behalf of the team, we request your favorable approval of the amended application.

[Speaker 1] (2:29:55 - 2:30:31)
Thank you Thank you, terry You're welcome obviously This is pretty enthusiastic Um project and has met with alderman maldonado's steadfast support uh You know, I this was on the pre not the last planning commission, but this was the previous planning commission, correct? And january 19th. Okay And what was there something about the connection from the bank to this?

It was It was some comments about that Um, i'm gonna let one moreno.

[Speaker 9] (2:30:31 - 2:30:38)
Um answer those questions because this is his design And I believe he's on I am hi chair.

[Speaker 23] (2:30:38 - 2:31:15)
Hi committee honored to be here You're correct. One of the questions was the physical connection between the library housing and the bank There is no connection between them. You can't go from the parking structure into the bank It's a very challenging scenario to go through that landmark building deal with all the requirements of landmarks To get through it also fire rating scenarios.

So in the end after reviewing it just made more Financial sense to leave the two be separate entities. They're also running on very different schedules Yeah That's what it was.

[Speaker 1] (2:31:15 - 2:31:25)
It was Yeah, you know the bank employees Would be parking in the newer structure have to come back down the street level and get over and vice versa upon exit

[Speaker 23] (2:31:26 - 2:31:45)
Correct and part of that is that this this wonderful story that you mentioned includes That my office will be relocating to the bank building will be the anchor tenant So in many ways i'm encouraging my staff to walk a little bit from the parking structure to the original historic entry

[Speaker 1] (2:31:46 - 2:31:52)
And again, I think for the record this whole project is 100 latino if i'm not mistaken

[Speaker 23] (2:31:53 - 2:32:21)
Yeah, I think for us the contractor It is and proudly is a way of just Elevating minorities into leadership.

And so it's another reason. It's such a proud moment for all of us And what this represents not just to us on the project but to the community Fantastic, um, I see alderman viegas's hand is up bill Chairman, thank you.

[Speaker 24] (2:32:21 - 2:33:17)
Uh, yeah, I I felt um Obligated to speak about this project having grown up In this area and seeing this building, uh being transformed into this A beautiful building here is something that the community definitely needs uh, and the fact that they're allowing uh the city's, uh allowing mbe firms to to prime these projects whether Uh invest southwest corridors are really something that I think in the long term is going to benefit the city Uh as we increase competition Uh in and justifying that um mwbe firms can lead can indeed lead projects of this scale So I just wanted to be on the record wholeheartedly supporting this seeing this Uh seeing this building transformed Uh, as I stated I lived in this area back as a teenager and so i'm glad to see that's being repurposed So thank you and good luck Uh, juan and your team.

Thank you all Appreciate it.

[Speaker 1] (2:33:18 - 2:34:19)
