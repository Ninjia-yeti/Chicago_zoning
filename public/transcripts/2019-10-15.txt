Aye. Any opposed? Opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it, and these items are deferred.

Okay. Now, this time we'll begin the public comment period. I want to note that we have actually two Zoning Committee meetings today.

This morning meeting, the cannabis ordinance will not be heard until 2 o'clock this afternoon.

[Speaker 65] (22:55 - 23:02)
I think we posted that, obviously noticed that up, so hopefully we'll see you at 2.

[Speaker 1] (23:04 - 23:07)
Yes, Alderman Riley.

[Speaker 27] (23:08 - 23:20)
Thank you, Chairman Tunney. Since you're talking about the 2 p.m. meeting, are we also to hear the electric vehicle ordinance at that meeting as well today? Because I know that there were a number of people here to testify on that as well.

[Speaker 1] (23:20 - 24:27)
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Thank you, Chairman.

And also, the antenna one with the parks is in the afternoon also. And of course, our Planning Commissioner will be at 2 o'clock in no particular order. We're going to get, yeah, we're going to have lunch.

I've listened to my colleagues, okay, so I hope you all had a cinnamon roll before it will be devoured. All right, so out of respect for everyone's time, each speaker limited to three minutes to address all items on the agenda. This will be the only opportunity to address these items and the committee will not conduct separate public comment before each agenda item.

All right, so let's start. Okay, all right, Alan Mellis. Alan is going to quickly talk on at least looks like three items, Alan.

[Speaker 30] (24:27 - 24:31)
That's correct. The agenda said four minutes, Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (24:34 - 24:35)
Let's start, Alan.

[Speaker 30] (24:35 - 24:36)
Let's see where we go.

[Speaker 1] (24:37 - 24:45)
Okay, Alan. Yeah, I know you have copies. I think we've distributed them.

[Speaker 30] (24:45 - 28:00)
Okay, let's go. Good morning. Good morning, Tom.

Good morning. I am Alan Mellis, committee leader for 45 years, speaking today as an individual, not representing the organization. I am testifying on three items and would prefer to give my testimony as each one is presented.

However, since this is not possible, please refer to my individual testimony pages for each item as is discussed. This is concerning the proposed golf driving range of Damon, Elson, and Fullerton. The following should be noted.

The citizens of the City of Chicago will be losing one of its most iconic restaurants when the drive-shack golf driving range will replace the Vienna Beef Cafe in Delhi. And two, City of Chicago has spent $22.5 million to reconfigure one of Chicago's most dangerous and congested intersections. Therefore, I have the following requests.

One, I strongly encourage drive-shack to incorporate a new Vienna Beef Cafe in Delhi into their building as their restaurant. This would serve their customers, the former patrons of Vienna Beef, and the users of the adjacent Chicago Riverwalk. Two, have a city-selected, developer-funded, independent traffic study to determine the impact on traffic ingestion on both this facility and the proposed Panera Bread and Chick-fil-A restaurants at this high-volume traffic location, if needed, require modifications to the plans.

I am in favor of the project to 961 Montana. This property was purchased by the CTA for the Brown Line Reconstruction Project and was sold after the project was completed. It is an odd-shaped lot immediately adjacent to the CTA tracks.

The developer met with the local neighborhood association and the adjacent neighbors. They responded to concerns, including making the formerly proposed blank wall facing the elevated more interesting to L riders. The project's two units on the first floor will be disabled accessible.

The transit area development will be adjacent to one of the busiest CTA stations, and two parking spaces should be adequate. The building will replace a lot that has been vacant for years, provide a sound barrier to buildings to the east, and lastly, the CHA building at 2604 North Sheffield. The renovation of the senior student building with central air conditioning and an improved heating system will be most welcome.

The renovation will be done without seniors needing to move to another location. The proposed design has been well thought out, includes having a new family building independent of the existing senior buildings, new amenity spaces for all residents, addressing concerns about alley congestion as well as being an attractive building. While the proposed building at the corner of Lincoln and Sheffield does not have a tenant, it is consistent with the formally approved Lincoln Avenue Revitalization Plan.

The tenant should serve the local CHA residents. The thoughtful addition of these new affordable units will be a small start in increasing the number of affordable units in our community. Thank you, Chairman.

Thank you, Alan. And two of those items you talked about are deferred, so we'll hear you again, I'm sure.

[Speaker 1] (28:01 - 28:11)
Okay, thanks. All right. George Blakemore.

Mr. George Blakemore.

[Speaker 20] (28:14 - 31:21)
I'm outraged with your behavior here. The people can't speak. All these items, we are entitled to speak on.

To these visitors here, go back to your country and tell them America is not a democracy. It's just as bad as these other communist countries. Are you understanding what I'm saying?

They got all the items, but they won't allow the public to speak on them. The public has to speak on all items for three minutes. That's unacceptable.

They are trying to silence the public. In particular, Mr. Blakemore, this was designed for me. They don't want to hear me because I tell the truth.

You have no right to implement, when Solis was there, how corrupt he was. You even worse, because you're trying to silence the people. You don't want to hear us.

And the way this game is played here with this zoning, everything is going to be passed. Everything is going to be passed. They were free.

They met before. They get a lawyer. They get an appraiser.

They get an architect. And they pay the place. So whatever comes up, 99% of the time, they will be approved.

It's a shadow. It's a dog and pony shadow. So go back to your country and tell them that this is not a democracy either.

It's not a democracy. It is worse than some of these dictatorships that come in this country. This man has said, you only can speak if it's 50 items.

You only can speak three minutes. He won't let you speak on each item. Why?

He don't want to hear the people. I'm entitled to speak on every item here. This is a pay-to-play here.

And the way they do it, all of them have attorneys. They pay their lawyers. Then they pay their appraiser.

Then they pay the architect and all. And then somebody else is getting paid. Some of these political attacks are getting paid.

That's why they call it pay-to-play. If you don't have any money, you're not going to win nothing. You can't come up on your own and make a presentation.

You can't do that. All of them, if you read the agenda, all of them have a lawyer. So if you're poor and can't afford a lawyer, your chances are almost nothing in getting rezoned.

And you say it's four minutes, then you're going to come out and change it to three minutes. You're terrible. You're worse.

You're trying to silence the people. They'd be back to you, all of them.

[Speaker 1] (31:26 - 32:31)
We'll see you this afternoon, I'm sure. All right. I'm going, let's see.

We've got a number of speakers to talk about Beacon, 4506 North Beacon. And I will call them in the order. They can all come up at the same time.

I should know if Martin Tangora, is that also the Beacon Project? I know you're the Magnolia-Malden neighbors. Is that correct?

Okay, fine. So Martin, come up, followed by Ray Mindock, William G-O-D-E-U, I think I got it right, William lives on Beacon, Paul Osgood, and James Sanders. Okay?

So we're going to all hear, what page is this one on?

[Speaker 64] (32:31 - 32:32)
Page 20, sir.

[Speaker 1] (32:32 - 32:36)
Page 20, great. Okay. And identify yourself for the record, please.

[Speaker 64] (32:37 - 33:02)
Yes, sir. Martin Tangora, I live on Magnolia Avenue, three blocks from the Sudbury site, Alderman Tunney, members of the committee, and ladies and gentlemen of the public, I, since 1985, when I put the Sheridan Park neighborhood on the National Register of Historic Places, I've been recognized as the historian of this part of Uptown. The lot where this proposal is made- Hold on a second.

[Speaker 1] (33:02 - 33:05)
Can we have a little bit of, I want to hear them.

[Speaker 64] (33:06 - 34:09)
Great. Was the mayor's residence in 1905. Mayor Dunn lived at this corner in a beautiful big house for a couple of years.

Later, he was the governor, the only man who's ever been both mayor and governor. But we're not expecting the house to be put back. What we are complaining about is that this lot, like all the other lots in the neighborhood, is residentially zoned.

This one is RS3, and all the neighboring lots are either RS3 or RT4. The proposal to make it rezoned as a business zone is irrational and fictitious because it's been agreed already behind closed doors that the zoning will go back to residential after the project is built. It hasn't been clear why it had to be business zoning, but I think the answer is because it allows a greater FAR.

This greater FAR will result in a four-story building on the back half of the lot, out of range, out of scale with the rest of the historic district. And it's for that reason that I and my neighbors are opposed.

[Speaker 1] (34:10 - 34:14)
Thank you, sir. Good morning.

[Speaker 34] (34:14 - 34:44)
Good morning. My name is Ray Mindock, and I am a resident of Sheridan Park. Can you hold the picture for me?

Okay. Sorry, we have a map of Sheridan Park, and I want you all just to see, this is the Sheridan Park Historic District. This is all residential.

The property in question is this blue dot in the middle of this low-density RT4, RS3 residential area. So my name is Ray Mindock. As I said, I've lived in Sheridan Park.

[Speaker 1] (34:44 - 34:44)
Ray, speak into the mic.

[Speaker 34] (34:44 - 36:55)
Oh, sorry. Sorry. Okay.

My name is Ray Mindock. I've lived in Sheridan Park for 25 years, three lots away from the existing building. I oppose the zoning change in the Sheridan Park Historic District.

The zoning change from the residential district to a mixed-use district is not representative of the location and compromises the integrity of the Sheridan Park Historic District. In 2000, residents got together and supported a down-zone effort to protect the single-family residents and other low-density zoning in our historic district. Working together with the former 46th Ward Alderman, the campaign was inclusive.

The information was shared throughout Sheridan Park with other block clubs and community organizations across uptown. More importantly, we worked with Mr. Tom Smith, the City of Chicago Zoning Administrator, to ensure the changes we were making were consistent with the Chicago Zoning Code and the intended practices. The current proposal to change the residential RS3 to mixed-use district B2-3 is inconsistent with the intended practices.

The zoning change from residential to mixed-use development is spot zoning. This change violates zoning that is consistent and uniform. The change to B2-3 does not reflect the current land use or density.

The density intrudes on the maximum height, side lot setback, and backyard setback. In addition, a curb cut, which is proposed approximately 10 feet from the existing alley, appears to be in conflict with the Department of Transportation street and site plan design standards. The developer has offered to change the zoning back after construction is complete.

At that time, it will be non-conforming zoning. So respectfully, I ask the Zoning Committee in the City of Chicago to deny this zoning change based on the inconsistency with the City of Chicago zoning practices and to preserve the historic district in Sheridan Park. Thank you.

[Speaker 77] (37:00 - 38:02)
Good morning. Thank you, Committee. Thank you, Alderman Tony.

My name is Bill Gadoo. I live in 4506 North Beacon. I, too, am following in succession with my neighbors.

Supporting the protection of the neighborhood, we realize and we appreciate the development that Mr. Seguros has invested into our neighborhood, but we truly believe that this is both illogical and disrespectful to the current ordinances. So we would like to support the RS-3 zoning and deny the B-2-3 business zoning. We believe, for many reasons, it is illogical.

We think the heightened density issue is also challenging. The request for curb cuts is illogical with the current zoning, which has protected our neighborhood, and we would like to also support the increased transparency in these processes through our neighborhoods, helping support and protect Sheridan Park. So with that, I would say thank you, and we support you.

Thank you, sir. I appreciate your attention.

[Speaker 65] (38:06 - 39:18)
Good morning. My name is Paul Osgood, and I live on Beacon Street. The current zoning designation is an RS-3, a residential zoning.

The request is for a business zoning, B-2-3. A quote from the Chicago Zoning website, this is a neighborhood mixed use for retail store fronts, apartments allowed on the ground floor, intended to spur development in commercial corridors. Intended to spur development in a commercial corridor.

This is not a business district, but a tree-lined street in a residential neighborhood. I don't object to development, and if the developer were requesting an upzone to a residential RT-4, I would have no objection as much of the neighborhood is currently RT-4. Please reserve business zoning for Wilson Avenue and Clark Street, but not Sunnyside and Beacon.

Thank you.

[Speaker 71] (39:18 - 40:44)
Thank you, sir. Hello, I'm Jim Sanders, and I've lived for 28 years at 4506 Beacon, which is adjacent to the lot, which is now a parking lot that they are trying to rezone. Sheridan Park was downzoned by this committee to protect the integrity of the historical area and the neighborhood.

I believe that it should stay within those zoning rights and not be upzoned. The upzone only causes for a higher density within the area, a parking problem, and also a problem with the value of the attended apartments or condos are out of range for the rest of the area, as the developer has also not been able to sell another development that he has down the street. We also are questioning the zoning of the B2-3 to the business zoning when no retail is planned in this building, and it would only maximize the size of the building to be from border to border to border within the three, and the architect's designs were not correct in the height.

They've not thought about what all of the roof lines would look like, and out my door I would have nine air conditioners. Thank you, and please do not allow for the upzone.

[Speaker 1] (40:45 - 40:58)
Thank you, sir. All right. Now we have Tony Lee.

Would you come up? This is Benson, I believe.

[Speaker 32] (41:08 - 41:17)
He's coming. Good morning, committee members. Did you receive my petition that I included with the email from Nicole?

[Speaker 1] (41:18 - 41:20)
We have received your petition.

[Speaker 32] (41:20 - 44:14)
Okay, thank you. Well, so I'm here to oppose application 20159. This is the rezoning from industrial to R-T4.

I canvassed the community, spoke to community members, my neighbors, and I got over 90 signatures opposing this rezoning, and most of the concerns were due to the parking problem that's already in Benson Street. The current design of these 18-unit townhouses do not allow for any street parking, and that will take up even more parking space for all the other residents in the area. And from experience, not everyone parks in the garage.

Some may park on the street, and since there's no street parking, this will exacerbate the problem. So I would like to just show you a picture of Benson Street currently right now. Currently you cannot park on the west side of Benson Street due to it already being very narrow.

As you can see, this is where the land is supposed to be rezoned and built with townhouses. But the residents do not oppose these developments. We just asked that it be rezoned to R-3 for detached single-family homes.

And it's also worth mentioning that there was a community member meeting regarding this issue, but based on my conversation with my neighbors, some did not receive this letter. I'm not sure if this was on purpose to reduce opposition or just reduce the information that was there. So when I did speak to some of my neighbors, they did not know that this land was even going to be developed.

So it's worth noting that there was not a lot of community input due to this fact. So I just asked that the zoning committee look into this. Also, this price of townhouses do not allow for any affordability.

It won't be affordable for the current residents, and it won't allow for a diverse group of incomes to be living in this.

[Speaker 1] (44:15 - 44:48)
If you wanted that photo to be given to the clerk so we'll have it, the parking on the street that you had a photo, I couldn't surmise. Thank you. Thank you.

All right, so the next item has been deferred, but we have Manuel Vega. Manuel, we've deferred it. You would like to still talk?

[Speaker 28] (44:49 - 46:32)
Yes, I would like to quickly talk. I don't plan to use my three minutes, but this item has been deferred, and thank you, Mr. Tooney and zoning committee members and public. My name is Manuel Vega, an 18-year resident of Claremont, 5100 block of Claremont, which is located in Ravenswood in Lincoln Square neighborhood, mostly RS3 zoned residential areas.

Claremont sits off of, as people that are familiar, sits off a block off of Western and Foster, but what has been proposed by Mr. Colapi is a rezoning from an RS3 to an RM4.5, which as it was represented to the alderman, there was a number of misrepresentations, and in fact, after meeting with the alderman meeting and the public, I came across my neighbors and communicated with them, and we basically pulled a petition together, the petition that I have signed here by 30 block members.

Basically, we, the undersigned neighbors, believe that the two separate lots have been repeatedly misrepresented by the owner and lawyers as one complete lot to the neighbors, community, alderman, and city committees in an attempt to blur physical boundaries, understate future development, and understate the negative impact to our charming block by increasing density. Excuse me.

[Speaker 1] (46:35 - 46:35)
I'm listening.

[Speaker 28] (46:36 - 47:54)
Okay. The private owner, Matthew Colapi, has sought to challenge the zoning designation of two lots on North Claremont Avenue in the 40th Ward, an area that attributes its charm to the quietness to the current land usage pattern of the low density RS3 zoning designation. These are two lots.

They are both signified by separate lots because Matt Colapi has been paying taxes on these two lots. In all the verbiage, it's trying to be sold as a single lot to get this large zoning. Basically, we, the undersigned, feel that the targeted designation for these two properties does not align with the current future vision of the streets area land use pattern and increases its density.

And therefore, we urge the zoning administration and committee zoning and landmark building standards to not recommend passage of this failed and fail the passage of 020196811. And I just have some supporting documentation that shows a lot of the inconsistency that I would like to submit into record. As a whole, we're not opposed to a development on this particular property.

We do not feel that it is within the future land use.

[Speaker 24] (47:54 - 47:55)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (47:55 - 47:59)
Thank you. And we'll receive the documentation there. All right.

[Speaker 77] (48:06 - 48:09)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (48:17 - 50:59)
So we're going to move on. There's a large group of people here for application number 20162T1 on the 2919 through 29 South Halsted, top of page six. They've graciously declined to testimony, but they are definitely in support of this item.

And if, for the acknowledgement of our committee, would you please stand if you, the 23 that are in support of this, please. I wanted to recognize them here and thank them for taking time out of their busy day. Again, these are the group of 23 individuals that signed up in support of 2919 through 29 South Halsted.

So we appreciate it. I'm sure we'll have your back on this one. Okay.

So I hope. So thank you very much. All right.

Now, what are we? Oh, okay. So where is my, where am I?

All right. Okay. So that concludes the public commentary portion of the meeting and we'll be moving on to the addendum to this meeting's agenda.

We have the appointment today to the commission on Chicago Landmarks. Resume for the appointee should be in front of you in your packet. So it's mayoral appointment 1923, the appointment of Tiara L.

Hughes as a member of the commission on Chicago Landmarks for a term effective immediately and expiring March 11th, 2023 to succeed Juan G. Moreno, whose term has expired. So can we sign up?

Alderman Smith, you want to move to your right? I think we're going to, where is our, come on down. Where's your resume?

Here. Good morning.

[Speaker 66] (50:59 - 51:00)
Good morning.

[Speaker 1] (51:00 - 51:11)
Could you identify yourself for the record and tell us a little bit about your background and why the mayor and her wisdom has appointed you to be on the Landmarks Commission?

[Speaker 66] (51:11 - 52:18)
Absolutely. Thank you. Good morning.

My name is Tiara Hughes and I come before the committee today thinking confirmation to my appointment to the commission of Chicago Landmarks. I am currently a resident of Chicago's third ward in the Bronzeville community and professionally I'm an urban designer with Skidmore, Owings and Merrill and a real estate broker with Century 21. I also serve on the national board of NOMA, which is the National Organization of Minority Architects.

We are an organization that's rooted back to 1972 that serves the mission of championing diversity in the design professions by promoting excellence, community engagement and professional development of our members. In addition to urban planning, I also have a background in architecture and appreciate the significance of our historic buildings and the footprints they bring to our culture today. I want to serve on this commission because preserving our city's built legacy is important and should not be taken lightly.

Thank you for your time and attention and I look forward to answering any questions you may have.

[Speaker 1] (52:19 - 52:24)
Okay, questions from committee members? Alderman Michelle Smith.

[Speaker 10] (52:26 - 53:14)
Then you'll be, we'll get you later. Alderman Walter Burnett. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I'd just like to commend the mayor on this appointment. This young lady has a very impressive resume. We appreciate the fact that she's involved with NOMA and fighting on behalf of equity and fairness for African American designers throughout the country.

I think this is a great choice. Landmark is a unique, Landmark is a unique committee, right? And so you really have to have a love for architecture to want to be on a Landmark Commission.

So we commend you for taking your time to do this for the city of Chicago. Thank you.

[Speaker 17] (53:15 - 53:17)
Thank you, Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 10] (53:17 - 53:18)
Thank you, Alderman Patel.

[Speaker 17] (53:20 - 54:06)
Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I too want to commend the mayor for the appointment of Tierra Hughes to the Landmarks Commission. Tierra is a fresh, new, young face who has a perspective on historic preservation.

She has a, you know, a familiarity with buildings and communities all across the city, and I think we need to have a young perspective like that. And also one with a cultural sensitivity to the tremendous amount of historic legacies and communities on the south and west sides, in addition to what she already knows throughout the city of Chicago. I highly support this appointment.

[Speaker 1] (54:07 - 54:14)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Alderman. Other questions from committee members?

Okay, Alderman Michelle Smith.

[Speaker 25] (54:15 - 55:18)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. A pleasure to meet you, and congratulations. I think it's wonderful that we have another architect on the Landmarks Commission.

It's very important. One thing I did want to ask you about is whether or not you've had any experiences. We have several historic districts in my community, and the communities very, very jealously guard them.

And sometimes their interpretations of how they believe the landmark district should be administered is the basis of their, you know, 30 and 40 years of experience. And there are always pressures about new kinds of changes and developments and things like that. And, of course, many people who live in landmark districts believe that maintaining them as closely as possible to what their perceptions of it are, why they're important.

How do you balance that, or do you agree that when you're in a landmark district, man, it's strict?

[Speaker 66] (55:21 - 55:44)
Thank you for your question. I would say that this scenario would be on a case-by-case basis. And obviously, if a district is historic, that is very important and shouldn't be taken lightly.

So we would take that into consideration, but then also the voices of the people in that environment are very important as well.

[Speaker 25] (55:44 - 55:48)
Thank you very much. Congratulations. I have no further questions.

[Speaker 1] (55:51 - 57:07)
Any more questions from committee members? If not, can I have a motion to do pass on the appointment? Alderman Dowell moves do pass on the appointment.

All those in favor, say aye. Any opposed? I don't hear any.

Can the chair of the ayes have it? And congratulations. Look forward to approving this at the Wednesday City Council meeting.

And I know it's effective immediately, so let's go get to work. Thank you so much. All right, moving on to the regular agenda.

Before we get on to the regular agenda, at the request of Alderman Smith, we're going to go out of order to the middle of page 19. Item number 20132, T1. Address 2616 through 18 North Clark Street.

Change request, B12 Neighborhood Shopping District to a B35 Community Shopping District.

[Speaker 65] (57:10 - 57:22)
What do we got here? This is an Alderman. Okay, attorneys, who's coming in for this?

[Speaker 1] (57:33 - 58:08)
Alderman Dowell. We're on page 19, middle of it. 20132, T1.

In the 43rd Ward. Okay, same. Good morning.

[Speaker 43] (58:10 - 1:00:27)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Liz Butler from the law firm of DLA Piper, located at 444 West Lake Street. And I, along with my colleague Rich Clowder, represent 2616 North Clark, LLC, the applicant for a zoning map amendment for the property located at 2616 North Clark Street.

With me today on behalf of the applicant are Jonathan Gordon, to my right, and Jordan Melovitz, to my left, from Experiential Capital, on behalf of the applicant. The applicant is seeking to rezone the subject property from the B12 Neighborhood Shopping District to the B35 Community Shopping District to allow for the establishment and operation of a boutique hotel within the existing five-story mixed-use commercial building. The property contains approximately 4,850 square feet of site area and is bounded by commercial properties on the north, Clark Street on the east, a public alley to the south, and residential properties to the west.

As I mentioned, the property is currently improved with a five-story mixed-use commercial building and a two-story detached coach house at the rear of the property. The applicant is planning to establish a boutique hotel within the existing building and coach house, and no new improvements are proposed for the site. The overall project FAR is expected to be 3.38, which is less than the maximum FAR permitted in this district. The hotel will contain a maximum of 20 hotel rooms, no vehicular parking spaces, and no bicycle parking spaces are provided on the site today, and none will be provided in connection with the proposed development. The applicant will also be required to seek approval of a special use from the Zoning Board of Appeals in order to authorize the establishment of the hotel. The proposed site plan and building design are depicted on the boards in front of you, and our team is available to answer any questions.

We have worked with Alderman Smith and the Department of Planning and Development on this project, and we understand that the alderman is in support of our application. We respectfully request that you recommend City Council approval of the application. We appreciate your time and consideration of the project.

[Speaker 11] (1:00:28 - 1:00:29)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:00:31 - 1:00:38)
Questions from committee members? Alderman Cary Austin.

[Speaker 18] (1:00:38 - 1:00:48)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning. This would be to the alderman.

With you doing a hotel and no parking, won't that add to more congestion in your area?

[Speaker 25] (1:00:50 - 1:01:02)
Well, there's actually a lot of parking across the street, so there's a lot of parking in the immediate area, so we didn't need it.

[Speaker 18] (1:01:02 - 1:01:06)
Oh, okay, because I know that you're normally not... Very congested area, yes.

[Speaker 25] (1:01:06 - 1:01:08)
There's a lot of parking immediately available.

[Speaker 18] (1:01:09 - 1:01:13)
Oh, so they'll be able to utilize that area? Sure. All right.

[Speaker 1] (1:01:13 - 1:01:22)
So, other questions for the team? And then I'm going to ask Alderman Smith to opine a little bit more on the project.

[Speaker 25] (1:01:22 - 1:02:38)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This project is a really great win for our community, strongly supported by our neighborhood organization. This property's being upzoned because it was really a pre-existing building that was downzoned years ago, and it is, for those of you who know Lincoln Park, it is an old apartment building directly next to the Wiener Circle.

So, we were very intent on saving, not letting the Wiener Circle go away, and not letting this building go away, and this developer came and said that they wanted to convert it to a boutique hotel, which hits a need. Our community has a need for short-term space that is hotel. It's not an Airbnb, it's a hotel.

It preserves a historic building, which I believe the developer is going to seek landmarking for. You may or may not seek landmarking, but it is being restored and renovated, and so it is a really, it hits every single need of our community. More hotel, with a hotel license, saving an old building on a street that is reviving.

So, I'd like to ask for your support.

[Speaker 1] (1:02:38 - 1:02:38)
Great.

[Speaker 25] (1:02:39 - 1:02:40)
Questions for the Alderman?

[Speaker 1] (1:02:43 - 1:02:59)
Hearing none, if there are no questions by committee members, motion to do pass. Alderman Kappelman moves to pass. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? The Chair, the ayes have it, and this item is passed.

[Speaker 3] (1:03:00 - 1:03:01)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:03:01 - 1:03:34)
Good luck. Okay, again, out of order on this one, we are moving to this one. Again, in the 43rd Ward, document number 20175-T1.

Ordinance referred on September 18th of 19, common address 961 West Montana, change request RM5, residential multi-unit district to a B23, neighborhood mixed-use district.

[Speaker 54] (1:03:41 - 1:03:43)
Good morning, Chairman, members of the committee.

[Speaker 1] (1:03:45 - 1:03:45)
Good morning.

[Speaker 54] (1:03:49 - 1:04:44)
Good morning. Katrina McGuire from Thompson-Coburn here on behalf of the applicant, 961 West Montana, LLC. Mr. James Jan of 961 West Montana, LLC is to my right, and Brady Bohlman of Space Architects and Planners is to my far right. She's setting up the boards right now. What we are seeking is to rezone this property from RM5 to B23 under a type 1 application for the purpose of constructing 8 units with 2 parking spaces. This is a unique site, sort of a trapezoidal, almost triangular parcel that is the remnant of a CTA taking.

It is directly adjacent to the CTA tracks. We've had several meetings with immediate neighbors and with rightward neighbors, and we have also agreed to rezone the property back once the property has been constructed. I have nothing further, unless there's any questions.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:45 - 1:04:52)
Questions from committee members. Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 12] (1:04:57 - 1:05:11)
Thank you, Chairman. I'm knocking over everything over here. I just want to commend Mr. Jan on his beautiful building and commend him for working with Alderman Smith on this newest addition to the community. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:05:12 - 1:05:13)
Alderman Michelle Smith.

[Speaker 25] (1:05:14 - 1:05:48)
Thank you. As everyone knows, lots that are next to the L tracks are awkward, and the community liked this concept because it will help, you know, it will have a blank wall against the L tracks, which helps deaden noise for the neighborhood. This has been vacant for quite some time, so after we had a community meeting, the community expressed support for a multi-unit building, including two accessible units.

So we think those are good additions to the neighborhood, and I request your support. Thank you. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:05:49 - 1:05:55)
So before we take a vote on this, do we have a move to a substitute on this?

[Speaker 54] (1:05:56 - 1:06:01)
I should have, yes, that could, if the recommendation be as amended.

[Speaker 1] (1:06:01 - 1:06:09)
So we'll move the substitute first. Alderman Dowell moves the substitute. But before we do that, Alderman Dowell has a question.

[Speaker 17] (1:06:10 - 1:06:29)
Hi. I just wanted to ask, does the financing for this building from your bank require you to provide a environmental, some kind of environmental assessment since you're building so close to the L? Okay.

Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (1:06:30 - 1:06:37)
Identify yourself for the record, Mr. Chairman. I'm sorry, James James. James.

Okay. So, yes, Alderman Roboyes.

[Speaker 14] (1:06:38 - 1:06:44)
This is considered transit-oriented development, TLD. Okay. All right, thank you.

Fingers crossed.

[Speaker 1] (1:06:46 - 1:07:23)
So with that, we're going to take two. We're going to do the substitute. Alderman Dowell moves the substitute.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

Substitute is before us. Now Alderman Roboyes moves to pass. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? The opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it as the substitute.

Narrative. Narrative and plans. Thank you, staff.

All right. Now, let me get the next one. So now we're going to the bottom of page five.

There's three documents.

[Speaker 34] (1:07:23 - 1:07:24)
I'm sorry.

[Speaker 1] (1:07:32 - 1:07:34)
That's the CHA.

[Speaker 3] (1:07:35 - 1:07:35)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:07:35 - 1:08:49)
All right. Oh, you know, bottom of page five, three application numbers. I'm sorry.

Okay. Bottom of page five, application number 20159, change request, M23 Light Industry District to an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district. Again, who's up?

Just two items while they come up. One was, obviously, Allen Malice was here. He was in support of the 961.

So we have that on record. And then this project, I believe, was the petitioner, Mr. Lee, if I'm not mistaken. Okay.

And there was a petition in the packets. Let's go. We got a long day today.

Yeah. All right. This is the one on Benson Street.

[Speaker 8] (1:08:58 - 1:09:40)
Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, my name is Mark Kupiec. I'm an attorney with offices at 77 West Washington. I represent the applicant and I have with me on behalf of the applicant, Mao May, seated beside me, next to him, John Hanna of Hanna Architects, the project architect.

And this particular application, we're looking to rezone subject property from an M2-3 to an R4. And as you know, of course, M2-3, an intense district. You could do factories, industrial uses, et cetera, dash three density.

However, we want to take it and rezone it out of the M2-3 and rezone it to residential.

[Speaker 1] (1:09:45 - 1:09:54)
Wait, wait. Hold on. We have the wrong plan?

[Speaker 8] (1:09:55 - 1:11:14)
All right. That's fine. Okay.

So we want to take it out of the M2-3 and rezone it to residential. We actually chose R4, which is the same district that exists across the street to the east across Benson. When the applicant started this project, which was a long time ago, he first talked to the alderman and he started the project exploring single family homes.

Worked with his architect, a couple of different site plans, met at least on two occasions, if not more, with the planning department staff trying to find an acceptable configuration for single family homes. You've got to work in a private drive to access the garages. In the end, could not find an acceptable configuration for the single family homes.

So the project before you today is townhomes. Next best thing. And the project calls for 18 townhomes.

Parking. The city requires one parking space per unit. Going to provide two car garages in this particular case, so we've got double the parking requirement.

And again, consulted with planning, worked with the alderman, and had a community meeting at which the project was displayed, described, and questions were answered. And with that, we ask for your support.

[Speaker 77] (1:11:18 - 1:11:20)
Do we have a substitute before us?

[Speaker 8] (1:11:21 - 1:11:42)
Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you. We do have a substitute type 1 plans and narrative.

It was filed as a type 1, but we have substitute plans and a substitute narrative. If one of your community members would be good enough, we'd like to proceed on the substitute type 1 plans and narrative.

[Speaker 1] (1:11:44 - 1:12:07)
Alderman, Kaplan moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type 1 application. All those in favor? Any opposed?

Hearing none, the substitute narrative and plans are accepted. Now, questions on this townhouse development in the 11th Ward from committee members? I know we have Alderman Thompson here.

[Speaker 39] (1:12:09 - 1:13:13)
Alderman Thompson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As Mr. Kubiak mentioned, we did have a community meeting. We've also had a number of discussions with the planning department. This particular parcel is a unique size. Adjacent to the south of this parcel is a plan development, residential plan development that hasn't started construction yet, but we're hopeful that that will start in the spring.

And this particular development is taken into consideration, the adjacent development. I think overall comprehensive plan, it will be good for the community. I know there was concern, as always, about parking in our community.

A lot of our neighbors have cars, unlike some other communities that use ride share. We oftentimes have multiple cars. This has two cars parking, as well as some street accommodating the parking in front of the townhome.

So I respectfully request the support of this zoning change by the committee.

[Speaker 1] (1:13:16 - 1:13:20)
Questions for the Alderman. Alderman Osterman.

[Speaker 41] (1:13:21 - 1:13:27)
Are the cars in the 11th Ward bigger or smaller than other parts of the city? Out of curiosity.

[Speaker 39] (1:13:29 - 1:13:50)
Good question, Alderman. We probably have larger cars than they do in some of the other more dense areas. But all kidding aside, we do have that concern with off-street parking as we have throughout the city.

And I think the developer has accommodated that, both with the two-car parking, as well as some street parking.

[Speaker 1] (1:13:54 - 1:14:53)
You good? All right. Any more questions for the Alderman?

Hearing none, do I have a motion from Alderman Lopez? Moves due pass. All those in, wait, pass with substitute narrative and plans.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

Opinion of the Chair, these items are passed with the substitute narrative and plans. All right. We're going to stay in the 11th Ward.

We're on to page, top of page 6, document number 20162T1, the 11th Ward ordinance referred on September 18th of 19, common address 2919 through 29 South Halsted. Change request, M12 limited manufacturing business park district to B32 community shopping district. So we have, as you know, we have a lot of support from the audience on this one.

So can you proceed?

[Speaker 8] (1:14:54 - 1:16:06)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My name is Mark Kupiec. I'm an attorney with offices of 77 West Washington, represent the applicant.

And I have with me today on behalf of the applicant, Michael Zhao. And Michael, I think, is walking down from the seating section. And our situation here is that the applicant currently operates an existing daycare center in the building on the subject property.

But because the existing zone is manufacturing, there's a limitation on the square footage that could be devoted to daycare. It's a very popular daycare. He's got a waiting list.

He'd like to expand. In order to expand, we needed to rezone out of that M district. We chose the B3 district to allow him to make that expansion.

Worked with Alderman Thompson. At the alderman's request, we had a community meeting, a well-attended community meeting where they had almost unanimous support. And I do understand we've got some of those supporters down here today.

I think just to express support, not necessarily to testify. But again, with the community meeting, the support was strong. There's a need for it in the neighborhood.

And again, we've continued to work with Alderman Thompson to ask him for his support.

[Speaker 1] (1:16:07 - 1:16:09)
Questions from committee members?

[Speaker 8] (1:16:10 - 1:16:11)
Alderman Thompson.

[Speaker 39] (1:16:13 - 1:16:44)
Again, I would ask that the committee support this zoning change. We worked, as Mr. Kubiak mentioned, we had a community meeting. We have a lot of support for this.

There was a smaller daycare being operated at this location along with the corporate offices. The operator has done, I think, a very good job of accommodating street traffic flow. And I think this will be a good addition to the community.

And I, again, respectfully request the support of the committee.

[Speaker 1] (1:16:46 - 1:17:42)
Any questions for Alderman Thompson? Hearing none, do I have a motion? Do pass on this item?

Alderman Beall moves do pass. All those in favor? Aye.

I'm sorry. Do you have a question, Alderman Beall? Okay.

All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed?

The ayes have it and this item is passed. Thank you. And now we are going to stay in the 11th Ward.

Yep. Middle of page 6. Document number 20180, T1, 11th Ward.

Ordinance referred again on September 18th of this year, 19. Common address 3849 through 53 South Union Avenue. Change request M23, Light Industry District to a B2-2 Neighborhood Mixed Use District.

[Speaker 21] (1:17:43 - 1:18:17)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the board. My name is Paul Kolpak, offices at 6767 North Milwaukee Avenue. I represent the applicant Vision Group Investments LLC.

As you've mentioned, we're requesting a zoning change to M2-3, Light Industrial District to that of a B2-2 Neighborhood Mixed Use District. The purpose of this is to subdivide the existing property into three lots and build three single-family homes with a two-car garage on the property. This neighborhood is relatively unique in that across the street...

Hold on a second, Paul.

[Speaker 1] (1:18:17 - 1:18:23)
Thank you again for our neighbors on Halsted Street. Thank you for coming down. Continue.

[Speaker 21] (1:18:23 - 1:18:48)
The property is relatively unique in the fact that across the street are single-family homes, but it is still in the manufacturing district. The property adjacent to it is zoned RT4. We believe this zoning change would better reflect the characteristics of the neighborhood.

We did have a meeting with the aldermen and community groups. Because it's all single-family home, everybody was in support of our zoning change.

[Speaker 1] (1:18:49 - 1:18:56)
Questions from community members on this application? Seeing none, Alderman Thompson.

[Speaker 39] (1:18:57 - 1:19:36)
Mr. Chairman, again, I'm respectfully requesting the support on this zoning change. As Mr. Kopach mentioned, we did have a community meeting. This particular lot was a vacant parking lot for what was Lee Lumber, a business on Pershing.

This will be re-subdivided and single-family homes which match the rest of that block of 3800 Union. The community was very supportive and is very supportive of this. Again, I would ask for your support and the committee's support on this.

[Speaker 1] (1:19:38 - 1:20:39)
Questions for Alderman Thompson? Hearing none, do I have a motion by Alderman Raboyas? Move to pass.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

Hearing none, the ayes have it. Item is passed. Thank you, Paul.

Now, we're going to go out of order one more time, I believe. Bottom of page 13. Okay.

All right. Bottom of page 13, is that correct? Yes.

Item number 20138 in the 31st Ward, ordinance referred 918 of 19, common address 5259 West Roscoe, change request RS3, residential single unit detached house district to an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district.

[Speaker 50] (1:20:42 - 1:20:42)
Great.

[Speaker 1] (1:20:44 - 1:20:44)
Counselor?

[Speaker 60] (1:20:46 - 1:22:27)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is William J.P. Banks from the Shane Banks Law Firm. I'm here today with my client, Tim Conlin, and architect, John Hanna, for the purpose of changing the zoning from an RS3 to an RT4.

The purpose of the rezoning is to renovate the interior and existing building to allow two dwelling units, so it would be three all together, with three parking spaces and a rooftop deck. This matter has been pending for a while. There was outreach to the alderman of the 31st Ward, Alderman Cardona, who was very gracious in supplying a letter of support to the committee, a copy of which you have in your file.

We have had no objectors to this matter at all. The building itself is going to remain as is. The renovations are interior.

The height stays the same. It is basically a lot-to-lot structure. Once again, the outreach to the community was very solid, again with no opposition.

That being said, we stand ready to answer any and all questions you may have.

[Speaker 1] (1:22:27 - 1:22:33)
Questions from committee members? No questions. Alderman Cardona.

[Speaker 42] (1:22:34 - 1:22:35)
Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 40] (1:22:36 - 1:23:07)
I support the zoning change because it will bring more housing into my community. Also, when I spoke to the neighbors surrounding the building, 250 feet to 500, they were very supportive. I explained to them what the site is going to consist of, three apartments, and each apartment is going to have their single space for parking, which they are very grateful for that.

So, on that, I am seeking for your support and my committee members to change the zoning.

[Speaker 1] (1:23:08 - 1:23:16)
Questions for the Alderman? No questions. I have one question.

How long was it a funeral home?

[Speaker 60] (1:23:17 - 1:23:19)
Probably about 20 years, maybe longer.

[Speaker 1] (1:23:22 - 1:23:38)
It looked like a traditional two-flat, and it wasn't as ornate as I've seen even in the smaller funeral homes. Good luck. Okay.

Questions? Alderman Kappelman. All those in favor?

[Speaker 34] (1:23:39 - 1:23:39)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (1:23:39 - 1:23:53)
Any opposed? Thank you for bringing life back to Roscoe. As someone who owned a funeral home in my career, there's too many jokes about that.

[Speaker 60] (1:23:53 - 1:23:55)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee.

[Speaker 1] (1:23:56 - 1:24:28)
All right. Now we're on the top of page 16. Application 20181 in the 34th Ward.

Where are we at here? 20181, 34th Ward. All ordinance referred on September 18th of this year.

Common address, 11500 South Halsted Street. Change request. B31 Community Shopping District to a C11 Neighborhood Commercial District.

[Speaker 5] (1:24:31 - 1:24:40)
Good morning. Nick? Good morning, Chairman.

For the record, Nick Fetikas from the Law Offices of Sam Banks.

[Speaker 1] (1:24:40 - 1:24:42)
It's going to be a long day, Chairman.

[Speaker 5] (1:24:42 - 1:25:12)
I'm here on behalf of 115 Halsted Properties, LLC. The applicant owns a subject property that's currently a 32,351 square foot site functioning five pump gas station. We are seeking a zoning change from B31 to C11 in order to permit the addition of a car wash facility.

We've worked with Alderman Austin's office to this point. We would defer to the alderman for any further comment on the application.

[Speaker 1] (1:25:13 - 1:25:19)
Questions from committee members for the applicant seen on? Alderman Kerry Austin.

[Speaker 18] (1:25:19 - 1:25:54)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As our attorney has said, but let me say this about our tenant, which operates a gas station, and usually you really can't say anything good about them because they don't keep a good service station. But I can say that mine truly does care about the community and where he's operating his gas station.

He keeps it clean. He's respectful to the patrons, and I'm glad that he's here and going to open up the car wash. So if there's no objections, I hope that the committee will support this zoning change.

Questions for the alderman?

[Speaker 1] (1:25:55 - 1:25:57)
No questions. Alderman Roboius.

[Speaker 18] (1:25:58 - 1:25:59)
Moves do pass.

[Speaker 1] (1:25:59 - 1:26:50)
All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

Then you and the chair of the ayes have it. Item is passed. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Bottom of page 7. Move to page 7, item number 20171, in the 25th Ward, referred on September 18th of this year, 19th. Common address, 1653 South Troop Street.

Change request, C12 Neighborhood Commercial District to a B23 Neighborhood Mixed Use District.

[Speaker 55] (1:26:50 - 1:27:02)
Counselor? Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant.

First, I'd like to note, I think maybe you did it intentionally, skip the bottom of page 6, but that's okay.

[Speaker 65] (1:27:03 - 1:27:03)
Wait, what?

[Speaker 1] (1:27:04 - 1:27:07)
Did I miss just the page number on it?

[Speaker 64] (1:27:09 - 1:27:10)
No, we're doing it.

[Speaker 55] (1:27:11 - 1:27:27)
Oh, only, because, well, this is the bottom, but he has the bottom of page 6, which I don't know, the alderman on the 25th asked it to be, right, okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:27:28 - 1:27:29)
We can do both.

[Speaker 55] (1:27:29 - 1:27:30)
Okay, that's all right. I don't care.

[Speaker 1] (1:27:31 - 1:27:32)
If you behave, okay.

[Speaker 55] (1:27:32 - 1:27:33)
I'll try, it's hard.

[Speaker 1] (1:27:34 - 1:27:36)
Okay, so let's start on 7.

[Speaker 55] (1:27:36 - 1:28:19)
Let's start on 7, we'll go backwards. Here with me is Veronica Chavez, she's the owner of the property. She owns an existing building, it's a two-story building, has three levels in it, because it has a basement, that was originally built, it was built in the late 1800s, it was built as a two-unit with a commercial space.

She'd like to refurbish the building, split some of the floors, so she ends up with four units and a commercial space. She has three parking spaces in the rear of the property, this is all interior rehab to the existing building. We have spoken with the alderman, he has done his outreach to the community, I believe he's provided the committee with a letter of support.

Happy to answer any questions you may have.

[Speaker 1] (1:28:21 - 1:28:42)
Questions for the applicant. Seeing none, Alderman Siccio-Lopez, would you like to comment, since we did go out of order to, you had a cinnamon roll probably. I did, I did.

Let's talk about Troop Street.

[Speaker 37] (1:28:43 - 1:29:04)
Yes, so the proposal has the support of the zoning advisory board, we revised the proposal in detail and it's great to see obviously members of the community staying and obviously increasing a little bit of the density that we need, so we're in full support of this project.

[Speaker 1] (1:29:05 - 1:29:43)
Okay, questions for the alderman? Hearing none, Alderman Raboillas moves to pass. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? Opinions, share the ayes have it, and this item is passed.

Now, we're going to move to Page 6, bottom of page 6, item number 20156T1 in the 12th ward, ordinance referred on September 18th of 19, common address 2720 West Cermak Road, change request B32 community shopping district to B23 neighborhood mixed use district.

[Speaker 65] (1:29:46 - 1:29:47)
Proceed.

[Speaker 55] (1:29:47 - 1:30:28)
Rolando Acosta again, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, here on behalf of the applicant, here sitting with me is Farran Pavel, he is the owner of the property, this is a unique piece of property in the sense that it has a three-story residential building situated about 50 feet back on the lot along Cermak Road, so what Mr. Pavel would like to do is build an addition to the front of the building, four-story addition, go from three units to four units, he will retain the two parking spaces in the rear and for that purpose he is seeking the rezoning to the B23 district. He is here to answer any questions, we've also met with Alderman Cardenas who has reached out to the community and I believe provided a letter of support.

[Speaker 1] (1:30:29 - 1:30:55)
We received a, I don't see Alderman Cardenas, do we have his letter of support? We do. Questions for the applicant?

No? No questions, Alderman Roboius moves to pass on this item, all those in favor? Any opposed?

The opinion of the chair, the ayes have it, item is passed.

[Speaker 55] (1:30:55 - 1:30:55)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:30:55 - 1:32:04)
Thank you. All right, let's go back to, now we're starting, all right, I knew Alderman O'Shea, is he in the back? Bennett, will you see if Alderman O'Shea is in the back?

Okay. If he wants to, right? No, okay, then we'll skip this one then.

So, page 2, okay. Aldermanic number 8492, 30th Ward, ordinance referred on July 24th of 19, common address 2700-2740 North Central Avenue and 5549-5601 West Diversity. Change request, B3-1 Community Shopping District and C1-1 Neighborhood Commercial District to a B1-1 Neighborhood Shopping District.

[Speaker 14] (1:32:05 - 1:32:26)
Alderman Roboius. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of this illustrious zoning committee that we have before us. The down zoning in this area is to bring the area to conformity with the existing area to better reflect the existing business area, B zoning.

With that, I ask for the support on the matter before you.

[Speaker 1] (1:32:27 - 1:32:37)
Any questions for the alderman? Hearing none, Alderman Beall moves to pass. All those in favor?

Aye. Aye.

[Speaker 14] (1:32:37 - 1:32:38)
Any opposed?

[Speaker 1] (1:32:38 - 1:32:41)
The opinion of the chair, the ayes have it, and this item is passed.

[Speaker 14] (1:32:41 - 1:32:43)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:32:43 - 1:33:03)
Bottom of page 2, document number 20142-T1 in the 1st Ward, ordinance referred on September 18th of 19, common address 906 North Ashland Avenue. Change request, B1-2 Neighborhood Shopping District to a B1-3 Neighborhood Shopping District.

[Speaker 24] (1:33:05 - 1:33:54)
Counselor. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the board. My name for the record is Thomas S.

Moore. With me today is the president of the Condo Association and one of the residents. It's a two-unit building above a commercial unit, and Ms. Chow has family needs that require a little more space, and all she's doing is taking an outdoor space and including it in her indoor living space. It's only adding 160 square feet, but the property was previously maxed out, and she's been through a process with Alderman LaSpada in the 1st Ward, and he's here, and we have his support, and we request your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (1:33:56 - 1:34:02)
Questions for the applicant? Alderman LaSpada, then.

[Speaker 37] (1:34:03 - 1:34:04)
Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 31] (1:34:04 - 1:34:19)
Yes, it's a small change, but I think it really reflects the quality of life that the family is seeking for their unit, and seems very sensible given the surrounding community and surrounding zoning. Pleased to lend my support to this application.

[Speaker 1] (1:34:20 - 1:34:36)
Thank you, Alderman. Questions for the Alderman? Can I have a motion?

Motion by Alderman Cary Austin. Moves do pass. All those in favor?

Aye. Aye. Any opposed?

Opinions here, the ayes have it, and this item is passed.

[Speaker 24] (1:34:36 - 1:34:37)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (1:34:37 - 1:35:07)
We're going to stay on two, correct? I saw, okay. So now we're on page two still.

Document number, Aldermanic 8486, 19th Ward, ordinance referred on July 24th of 19. Common address, 11060 Southwestern, change request, B31 Community Shopping District to a B11 Neighborhood Shopping District. Alderman Matt O'Shea.

[Speaker 13] (1:35:09 - 1:35:23)
Thank you, Chairman. Yes, this is just conforming to previous zoning in that area. This is regarding land use, and I appreciate the consideration of...

[Speaker 1] (1:35:23 - 1:35:38)
Questions for Alderman O'Shea? Hearing no questions, Alderman Raboyas moves do pass. All those in favor?

Any opposed? Opinions here, the items have it, and this item is passed.

[Speaker 2] (1:35:38 - 1:35:39)
Thank you, Chair.

[Speaker 1] (1:35:39 - 1:36:27)
And get that railroad crossing open. I was out there last night, I can't go to 115th and back, and I'm not happy. All right.

Top of page four. Item number 20146, I get it wrong. Item number 20146 in the second ward, ordinance referred on September 18th of 19.

Common address, 1854 West Iowa Street, change request, RT4 Residential Two-Flat Townhouse and Multi-Unit District to an RM4.5 Residential Multi-Unit District.

[Speaker 31] (1:36:27 - 1:37:14)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the board, my name is John Pekarsky, I'm an attorney with offices at 55 West Monroe Street, and I represent Mr. and Mrs. Aaron Vilton, who are seated to my right. They own and have owned the property in question for quite a while. They live there.

The lot is substandard. It's 24 by 100, and they are seeking to improve the building itself because of their increased family, the increased age and need of their family. We, of course, have met with Alderman Hopkins, who is here, I believe.

[Speaker 1] (1:37:15 - 1:37:17)
We'll get to him. Are you finished with your presentation?

[Speaker 31] (1:37:17 - 1:37:18)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (1:37:19 - 1:37:24)
Questions for the applicant? Alderman Hopkins.

[Speaker 67] (1:37:27 - 1:37:51)
Yes, thank you, Chairman Tunney. We did meet with the applicant. There is no objection to this on file from either the immediate neighbors or the Community Association of Record, so I am in support of this project.

I have filed a letter of intent to return it to its original zoning after this matter is resolved. But this will allow the applicant to proceed with their plans, which we are in full support of.

[Speaker 1] (1:37:52 - 1:38:04)
Thank you, Alderman. Questions for Alderman Hopkins? I wanted to reiterate that his support is contingent upon completion to bring the zoning back down?

[Speaker 31] (1:38:04 - 1:38:08)
Yes, we've agreed to that. Great. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:38:09 - 1:38:17)
So, motion by Alderman Roboyes to move do pass on this item. So moved. All those in favor?

[Speaker 18] (1:38:17 - 1:38:18)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (1:38:18 - 1:38:22)
Any opposed? The chair of the ayes have it, and this item is passed.

[Speaker 31] (1:38:22 - 1:38:23)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (1:38:23 - 1:38:39)
For your investment. Okay. All right, we're going to move out of order one more time.

Middle of page 20. Let me get to it myself.

[Speaker 38] (1:38:48 - 1:38:48)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:38:49 - 1:39:30)
All right. I think we still have... Okay.

This is the one we had a number of witnesses here on item number 20183-T1. In the 46th Ward, ordinance referred on September 18th of 19, common address 4502-04 North Beacon Street. Change request.

RS3 residential single unit detached house district to a B23 neighborhood mixed use district. We're ready to go?

[Speaker 5] (1:39:30 - 1:40:29)
Yes, sir. All right. Counselor.

Thank you again for the record. Nick Fitikas from the Law Offices of San Banks. I'm here on behalf of the owner and applicant, Malden Development LLC, series 4502-04 North Beacon.

The applicant, again, owns the subject property, contains about 8,110 square feet of total lot area, and today it's a surface parking lot. The applicant is proposing to redevelop the site with a new nine-unit residential building that would have 10 garage parking spaces located within the building. The proposed building at its highest point would measure 46 feet 2 inches, although it has been tiered toward the front to reduce massing along Beacon.

We've worked with the Beacon Block Club as well as Alderman Kappelman's office, and we believe we have his support to proceed at committee today.

[Speaker 1] (1:40:31 - 1:40:39)
Thank you, Nick. So there was a number of people that are in objection to this.

[Speaker 5] (1:40:40 - 1:40:49)
You didn't have the site plan or anything? You know what? I have a hard copy.

I don't have the electronic copy, but I can provide a hard copy if you'd like.

[Speaker 1] (1:40:52 - 1:41:13)
Yeah, might as well. So obviously we're going to hear from the alderman. Well, let's ask for questions for the attorney.

No questions? Alderman Osterman.

[Speaker 41] (1:41:13 - 1:41:25)
Thank you. One of the issues raised, just out of my curiosity, is why a B2-3 instead of a residential zoning?

[Speaker 5] (1:41:25 - 1:42:08)
So the B2-3 is a district that allows for either residential on the first floor or retail. We filed this as a Type 1 zoning change, so it's mandatorily going to be developed as an all-residential building. We are asking for the Dash 3 designation to allow nine units to be developed on the site, but we're actually staying under a 2.0 FAR for the overall development. So the Type 1 zoning change, the B2-3 gives us the flexibility for the unit count as well as it encompasses the overall size, but at the same time it's limited by the Type 1 zoning application and the plans that are filed with the application.

[Speaker 41] (1:42:09 - 1:42:13)
Not a residential R24, R25 that would fit in with?

[Speaker 5] (1:42:14 - 1:42:33)
I believe we'd have to go either an ARM 5.5, which there wasn't any. So the idea was go to the B2-3, and then we made a restrictive covenant with the Beacon Block Club to downzone so that the B2-3 is off the map after the project is completed.

[Speaker 41] (1:42:35 - 1:42:49)
Okay. And so there won't be any business, and as soon as this passes you're going to downzone it so that it will go back to the residential zoning. There's no intention to put residential on Beacon.

100%.

[Speaker 5] (1:42:49 - 1:43:07)
Business on Beacon. Business on Beacon. My fault.

There's no business, and we wouldn't be able to because the Type 1 plan that's been filed with the application doesn't incorporate any business. So if the plan ever changed, we'd have to come back and amend our Type 1 plan and come back before this committee.

[Speaker 41] (1:43:08 - 1:43:17)
Question. Small one is the curb cut. There was a complaint about the curb cut, and I'm assuming there's an alley on Beacon that would provide residential.

What's the issue with the curb?

[Speaker 5] (1:43:17 - 1:43:58)
The issue on that is in order to fit, we were told we had competing interests. We needed to provide as much parking as possible, and we are providing 10 parking spaces to support nine residential units. To be able to meet code compliant parking within the garage on the first floor was to come off the side street as opposed to coming off the rear.

The width of the building and the width of the lot don't allow the aisle widths internally to provide or to meet that 10 parking space total. So we made a decision based on the input from the block club to provide more parking as opposed to coming off the alley and lose parking. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:43:59 - 1:44:30)
Questions from before the alderman speaks, I want to ask a question on this one. So obviously this is a historic district as was alluded by our objectors. As Alderman Osterman said, most of the surrounding, the current zoning is RS3, RS4.

This is a big, what could you do under the RS3?

[Speaker 5] (1:44:30 - 1:45:42)
Under the current RS3, we could do a two flat and a single family home at best because we only have 8,600, I'm sorry, 8,100 square feet of total lot area. So the RS3 is quite limited. I'd also point out for the committee, the entire area is made up of bigger developments.

So that RS3 that you see on the map is not reflective of a single family home block. In fact, our neighboring structures have multiple units. The other four corners, I'm sorry, the three other developed corners have, and I believe it's 16, 24, and I think 12 unit buildings respectively on those four corners.

So the down zone was put in place, I presume to protect the future development of that corner lot. It's really the only undeveloped lot in the immediate area, but it's frankly the RS3 is non-reflective of the actual building improvements, the four story multi-unit apartment and condominium buildings that are developed in the immediate area. And then the, Alderman Dell.

[Speaker 17] (1:45:44 - 1:45:50)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. What was the recommendation from the Department of Planning and Development?

[Speaker 1] (1:45:52 - 1:45:53)
Patrick or Steven?

[Speaker 38] (1:45:54 - 1:46:08)
Steve Valenziano, Department of Planning and Development. We recommend against the zoning change for the reasons that were stated earlier. It's a business mixed use business district in the middle of a residential district.

[Speaker 1] (1:46:10 - 1:46:20)
That was the T1 though, component of it though. Cause it's T1. Even with the T1 as residential on the ground floor.

Steven?

[Speaker 38] (1:46:20 - 1:46:37)
Yes, it is a type one. We think that there's other residential zoning districts that would be less, one less unit, eight units, rather than nine that would be more appropriate based on the other zoning and other development in the neighborhood.

[Speaker 1] (1:46:39 - 1:46:52)
So as the attorney discussed, we talked about RS3, but if it was an RS4, is that what you're saying? We could do that in a, in a residential?

[Speaker 38] (1:46:52 - 1:46:59)
Under the RT4, you could do eight units on this property and you could fit the parking in off the alley without the curb cut.

[Speaker 5] (1:47:01 - 1:47:36)
Attorney, do you want to talk about that? We've presented this as a nine unit development based on the, the financing, the cost of the construction and the delivery. We need that ninth unit to make this building work.

We looked at that as an option with Beacon Block Club. We actually presented that and explained how we do need that ninth unit, which goes back to my response to Alderman Osterman that the dash three, the only component of the dash three is the density that we're trying to use or get to for the nine unit total.

[Speaker 1] (1:47:37 - 1:47:41)
Other questions? Alderman Kaplan.

[Speaker 13] (1:47:42 - 1:50:06)
Thank you. Residents expressed concerns about this B2-3 zoning that would allow a business, but it's my clear understanding because it's type one, that's impossible to, to occur. Even if a business did go in there, which is not possible, but that business would fail because it's in the middle of a residential area.

No business wants to go in there. And it just wouldn't be good business practice. Residents concerned, expressed concerns about the historic nature of this area and therefore did not want the up zone.

The proposed project will blend in with the historic nature of the community. The residents wanted a single family home instead with a tour. This would have to cost well over $2 million and it would just be extraordinarily difficult to sell.

Especially when two and three bedroom units are in huge demand in that area. We have a lot of micro units and we have some single family homes. We just don't have enough to, and especially three bedroom units.

The overall concern expressed over and over again that the new owner of this property did not want to rent out the parking that presently exists. Many of the objectors parked their cars there. It was their opinion that the new owner should continue renting spaces for their cars.

So I support this for the following reasons. I wholeheartedly believe that Sheridan Park should remain historic and a parking lot does not fit into the historic nature of this area. A single family home worth over $2 million would be very difficult to sell and therefore is just not a doable option.

Members of the block club, it's one of the smallest block clubs in the 46th Ward, voted in favor of this project of 116 to 96. We had more people voting on this project than we have had on projects worth 10 times that amount. So it's been my consistent pattern to support the affected block club on these zoning changes.

And I will continue to support that process. So I ask my colleagues to vote in favor of this. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:50:08 - 1:50:19)
Other questions for the alderman? All right. Do I have a motion to move to pass on this item?

[Speaker 18] (1:50:20 - 1:50:20)

The matter was before the plan commission on September 19th, 2019, where it received a recommendation for approval. And accordingly, I'd like to ask that the transcript from that hearing be made a part of this.

[Speaker 1] (1:55:18 - 1:55:26)
So Alderman Roboius moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission. All those in favor. Any opposed.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. This proposed development was taken before the three community organizations in the area, West Central Association, West Loopgate, and now they all approved this project. We had a community meeting at the community meeting.

There was some input about some changes to the design. Developers adhere to those changes. So the community supported the development due to those accommodations.

This developer has committed to, along with the previous developer who just, who was before them, they committed to joint venturing with a minority contractor on a construction of these projects, which will help them to be able to meet their 30% minority participation on their development. So with that, Mr. Chairman, we ask that the committee support this project.

[Speaker 1] (1:57:39 - 1:58:05)
Questions for the alderman. Hearing none. I have a motion to move do pass on this item.

Thank you, Michael Asger on behalf of the applicant, Ella associates. And with me today is Thomas come 40. Who's a principal with the applicant as a preliminary matter.

This did go to the plan commission in September where it received approval. And it was, went to the plan commission because although a type one rezoning, it was in an, it's in an industrial corridor. So it received approval there.

And I I'd respectfully request that the findings of the plan commission be incorporated into the record here today.

[Speaker 1] (1:59:29 - 1:59:39)
Alderman Kappelman moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission. All those in favor. Aye.

Any opposed. The ayes have it. And the records are now incorporated.

[Speaker 22] (1:59:39 - 2:00:13)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, as an additional housekeeping matter, this was also, we filed a substitute narrative and plans as well as a substitute ordinance in this matter. The, there were some changes through the plan commission process, which we incorporated. And as well, the zoning was amended down from a D S five to a D S four.

To a D S three. And so I would respectfully request that the substitute narrative and plans and the substitute ordinance be incorporated for the record. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:00:14 - 2:00:48)
So we have two motions here, I believe. So Alderman Roboius moves to accept the substantive narrative and plans for the type one application. So, so moved all the, all those in favor.

Aye. Any opposed. The ayes have it.

And the substitute narrative and plans are accepted. And now. Alderman Kappelman moves to accept the substitute ordinance.

All those in favor. Say aye. Aye.

And any opposed. The ayes have it. And the substitute is accepted.

[Speaker 22] (2:00:49 - 2:01:24)
So while it's the same building, there's a lot of administrative stuff for the one story building, which remains as is. And the zoning change allows for the use to be expanded as office. This is intended to be rented out as a high tech office to occupy the full building.

We went and saw the West central association, the neighbors of the West loop and the West loop community organization. We, and we have letters of support with us from the West central association and the neighbor and the West loop community organization and Alderman Burnett is, is here as well.

[Speaker 10] (2:01:24 - 2:01:25)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:01:25 - 2:01:30)
Questions for the team there over there. Alderman Burnett then.

[Speaker 10] (2:01:30 - 2:02:35)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. Because, because they, they aren't changing and they're not changing anything to the building except the interior. The community organizations felt like they didn't need to have a community meeting in regards to this because the building isn't changing.

So we did have to develop a goal before all of the community organizations that showed them what they were doing. They all supported it. So we asked for the committee support.

Everything is changing. This used to be an industrial building. They had industrial use in there.

This organization, this was what climate was, but materials marketing. And so there's a lot of mechanical stuff in there. Now it's going to be used to identify with the rest of the community and have a lot of, a lot more office space, a lot more jobs in the neighborhood and it's going to enhance the community.

So we asked for the committee support on this. Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (2:02:36 - 2:02:45)
So questions for Alderman Burnett? Hearing none. I'm going to ask for a motion to pass as revised.

[Speaker 18] (2:02:45 - 2:02:46)
Don't move.

[Speaker 1] (2:02:50 - 2:03:14)
Comma. Substituted. Comma.

And with substantive narrative plans in place. So Alderman Austin, are you okay with that? You pass.

All those in favor. Aye. Any opposed opinion of the chair of the ayes have it as substituted with narrative plans and all the other good stuff.

Question.

[Speaker 38] (2:03:17 - 2:03:31)
One other. The there's a substitute ordinance that I don't know that they spoke to. We did to the DS three.

We did. Okay. I'm sorry.

I was so caught up in all the other substitutes. No problem. Thank you for triple checking.

[Speaker 18] (2:03:32 - 2:03:32)
Oh, we would live.

[Speaker 1] (2:03:34 - 2:03:39)
Yeah. Okay. Maybe there's white smoke.

Morning Mr Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Willie Carter. I am seeking to rezone the one story brick from RT four to a B two one in order to open my retail food store and deli business at nine fifty four west seventy first street in the Inglewood community where I grew up.

I am the owner of this property and I will also manage this business. I went to Alderman Sawyer asked for his support. The Alderman said this is a food dessert area and this business can be beneficial at this location.

I will. I will be providing fresh produce sandwiches and other foods and other items in demand in this area. My neighbors who I will be will be my patrol waiting for me to start my business.

I retain Mr. Kareem Musar who's to my right. My zoning consultant to help me file my application. We sent public notice to all my neighbors.

I spoke to the people in this local area who I will be doing business with and everyone said they would like to see my business open so there is a place nearby where they can buy fresh bread eggs sandwiches and soup. I expect to fill this gap in service with the products I will offer in my store. This store is an existing one thousand one hundred square feet 14 feet high brick store building and I have all street parking also.

I believe this is the best use of this property. I am ready to apply for my business license as soon as I have your approval. I expect to be a lasting benefit for this community.

So the chairman of chairman or the members of the committee have any questions for me or Mr. Musar my my zoning consultant. We are available. I think there's only staff from their patients and assistants and I thank this committee.

I ask that you approve my application to rezone this property from R24 to a B21. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:06:27 - 2:06:35)
Thank you Mr. Carter. Questions for the applicant. Question Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 12] (2:06:37 - 2:06:49)
Thank you chairman. Good afternoon. Question Where would your customers be parking since everything around you seems to be residential.

[Speaker 36] (2:06:50 - 2:06:54)
It's free parking. There's no residential for permit parking is open.

[Speaker 12] (2:06:56 - 2:07:00)
And they wouldn't be able to park in front of your business because you're so close to the corner. Correct.

[Speaker 36] (2:07:01 - 2:07:09)
I believe it is parking right there. It's just when there's one handicap parking this about 100 feet behind the store or from the store.

[Speaker 12] (2:07:12 - 2:07:13)
Thank you chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:07:15 - 2:07:34)

Alderman Robles.

[Speaker 14] (2:07:44 - 2:08:10)

And the fact that he's coming before us is is wonderful and we support that. Thank you. Good luck to you.

Change request RT for residential two flat townhouse and multi unit district to an RM 4.5 residential multi unit district. Mr. Moore.

[Speaker 24] (2:12:23 - 2:13:21)
Thank you Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name for the record is Thomas S. Moore.

And joining me shortly here will be tail score T. Mr. Scott T. and his business prides themselves on taking older or in this case derelict buildings and trying to revive them.

This particular building actually had a variety of squatters in it and really had suffered a lot of damage but is a beautiful old building. And he has with his architect designed a building that will be very attractive to make that all work. He's asking to make it a four flat and Alderman Irvin had a community meeting at which we had the full support of the block and the community.

And we have a letter of support from Alderman Irvin and we'd request your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (2:13:21 - 2:13:41)
Questions for the attorney or the applicant. It could. Now that you have your board here I have a question.

What is the original building and what's going on with the sides. I know it looks like there's an is there an empty lot on each side of it.

[Speaker 38] (2:13:41 - 2:13:54)
So the original building is the red brick building and the only thing that we're doing is we're adding a mansard roof which is typical for that type of architecture.

[Speaker 2] (2:13:55 - 2:14:00)
There is an empty vacant lot that's been there for a long time which came up in our community meeting.

[Speaker 53] (2:14:01 - 2:14:03)
The building has these beautiful limestone.

[Speaker 1] (2:14:04 - 2:14:20)
The facade is beautiful. But what about the was that east west exposures. What is that.

I got the mansard roof I got the front. What is that gray material. Oh so that's just common brick but it didn't come out so well on the on the printing.

[Speaker 2] (2:14:20 - 2:14:22)
So this is all over.

[Speaker 1] (2:14:22 - 2:14:24)
Is it common Chicago brick. Yes.

[Speaker 2] (2:14:25 - 2:14:29)
And so the only thing that we're adding is above the common brick and above the face.

[Speaker 1] (2:14:29 - 2:14:37)
It just it just looks. If it's common Chicago brick versus split face or whatever else they use. OK.

[Speaker 3] (2:14:38 - 2:14:38)
That was my only.

[Speaker 29] (2:14:39 - 2:14:40)
Yeah.

[Speaker 1] (2:14:40 - 2:15:07)
I mean it's a. I mean it just. If that was the original building then that's the original building.

That's great. Yeah. OK.

All right. Little detail. Any questions.

We have a letter of support from Alderman Irvin. I have a motion. Move to pass by Alderman Lopez.

All those in favor. Aye. Any opposed.

Then you hear the ayes have it.

[Speaker 24] (2:15:07 - 2:15:08)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (2:15:09 - 2:15:38)
Good luck to you. Are we staying on page 11 here. Page 11 in the middle.

Document number 2 0 1 8 4 28th Ward ordinance referred on September 18th of 19. Common address 7 11 South Loomis Street. Change request.

Our T4 residential two flat townhouse and multi unit district. To an arm 4.5 residential multi unit district. Good morning.

[Speaker 11] (2:15:38 - 2:17:02)
Good morning. Good morning Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record.

My name is Sarah Barnes and I'm an attorney with the losses of Sam Bank. Happy to be here this morning on behalf of the applicant and property owner. Vargas Philip who is seated here to my right.

Mr. Philip just recently purchased the subject property which is presently improved with a two story with the basement three unit building. Unfortunately shortly after Mr. Vargas purchased the property and as part of his due diligence it was determined that the previous owner never pulled a permit for the build out of the basement unit as such. The building is nonconforming under the current zoning ordinance.

To cure this nonconforming condition since that dwelling unit is occupied currently and has been for over 20 years. We are here today seeking a zoning change from an R.T. for up to an R.M. 4.5 and again that is just to cure the nonconforming condition with the additional dwelling unit. There will not be any physical changes to the building itself.

Towards that end we have met with Alderman Irvin as well as the adjacent neighbors and we do have the support of all relevant parties at this time. I believe that Alderman Irvin emailed a copy of a letter of support to your office.

[Speaker 1] (2:17:04 - 2:17:10)
We haven't got an email but we did get his verbal support of it. So would you fine tune that and make sure we have it for our records.

[Speaker 11] (2:17:10 - 2:17:11)
Absolutely.

[Speaker 1] (2:17:11 - 2:17:16)
OK. But we do. We are aware that Alderman Irvin is in support of this.

[Speaker 11] (2:17:17 - 2:17:21)
Thank you. We'll make sure to get it memorialized and a letter sent to your attention.

[Speaker 1] (2:17:22 - 2:17:22)
Right.

[Speaker 11] (2:17:23 - 2:17:26)
And with that we'd be happy to answer any questions for the applicant.

[Speaker 1] (2:17:29 - 2:17:40)
Hearing none. I have a motion. Alderman Kappelman moves to pass on this item.

All those in favor. Any opposed. Chair the ayes have it.

We organized the community meeting mail notice with a business right down the street on Belmont had a well attended community meeting described the project and did have some comments mostly about the design features. So on this one we had filed it as a T 1 but we did give the department a substitute to T 1 plans and narrative.

I have a motion to accept the substitute narrative. Alderman. Alderman Roboyes moves the substantive narrative and plans for the type one application.

[Speaker 8] (2:21:13 - 2:21:45)
And the changes were not great. The change were mostly to the facade and the front and side elevations in response to some community suggestions. So that's why we made those changes and we think better and nicer building.

And it is a mixed use building. The nine dwelling units commercial on the ground floor residential units above. Actually the community was very pleased to see us do the mixed use building and do the commercial on the ground floor on Belmont to make it a more pedestrian friendly street.

Okay, thank you. And then, this is questions for the alderman. Since Walter walked out, are you trying to replace him with all these rapid-fire developments and things going on in?

[Speaker 14] (2:29:18 - 2:29:19)
Since who walked out?

[Speaker 12] (2:29:19 - 2:29:23)
Alderman Burnett? Usually, he does the most constant work.

[Speaker 14] (2:29:23 - 2:29:28)
Yeah, well, I told him I'll give him a break and just take over from this point on, so.

[Speaker 12] (2:29:28 - 2:29:29)
Awesome, thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 14] (2:29:29 - 2:29:31)
Doing a lot of work. Thanks to our folks in the community.

[Speaker 1] (2:29:33 - 2:30:37)
Okay, do I have a motion to pass with substantive narrative and plans? Alderman Lopez does that. All those in favor?

Aye, any opposed? Opinion Chair, the item is passed with the substantive narrative and plans. Thank you.

Good luck to you. Okay, now is the workhorse rebellious. We're still on the deferred agenda now.

We are, where are we at now? Top of page 25. Document number 20130 in the 30th Ward.

Ordinance referred on July 24th of 19. Common address, 3001 through 3007 North Austin Avenue. Change request, RS3, residential single unit detached house district to a C11 neighborhood commercial district.

[Speaker 8] (2:30:38 - 2:31:05)
Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, my name is Mark Kupiec. I'm an attorney with Offices of 77 West Washington, represent the applicant. I have with me today on behalf of the applicant, Hassan Azapira, seated beside me.

Number one, procedural matter. We would, we did give the department a copy of a substitute ordinance and we'd like to proceed on the substitute ordinance and the thrust is the substitute would rezone this to a B11, not a C11.

[Speaker 1] (2:31:06 - 2:31:23)
Okay, so can I get a motion to accept the substitute? Alderman, Alderman Roboyes moves to accept the substitute. All those in favor?

Any opposed? The substitute is, hearing none, the substitute is accepted.

[Speaker 8] (2:31:24 - 2:32:13)
Thank you. The subject property is currently improved with an old commercial building, used to be a tile company. It's vacant now, been vacant for some time.

The existing commercial building does not meet the setback requirements in the existing R district. The plan is to build a rear addition to the existing building and use the building for a daycare center. The rear addition also would not meet the setback requirements in that R district, hence we're asking to rezone it to a business district.

The Alderman asked us to do a community meeting. We had a community meeting in the building on the subject site, subject property, described the use and none of the people in attendance objected and actually thought a daycare center would be a nice use.

[Speaker 1] (2:32:13 - 2:32:24)
Great. Questions for the applicant? I just want to reaffirm, you're moving from an RS3 to a B11?

[Speaker 14] (2:32:24 - 2:32:25)
Correct.

[Speaker 1] (2:32:25 - 2:32:27)
Great. Alderman Roboyos.

[Speaker 14] (2:32:27 - 2:32:48)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is the old century tile, one of two locations in the immediate area. There's still one on diversity.

This also went through a community meeting. Several constituents were there and it was well supported and therefore asked for. Questions for the Alderman?

[Speaker 1] (2:32:52 - 2:33:10)
Hearing none, can I have a motion to move this item passed as amended? Alderman Osterman moves this item to pass as amended. All those in favor?

Any opposed? Can you tear the ayes, have it as this item is passed as amended.

[Speaker 8] (2:33:11 - 2:33:11)
Thank you. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:33:13 - 2:33:52)
All right, where are we back to now? Middle of page 14, document number 20165-T1 in the 32nd Ward, ordinance referred on September 18th of 19, common address 1601 Northwestern Avenue. Change request from a B32 Community Shopping District and an M12 Limited Manufacturing Business Park District to a B32 Community Shopping District.

Counselor.

[Speaker 11] (2:33:52 - 2:35:55)
Thank you. Good morning again, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. Once more for the record, my name is Sarah Barnes and I'm an attorney with the Law Offices of Sandbank.

Happy to be here this afternoon now on behalf of the applicant BW North and Western LLC. Here with me is the managing member of that LLC, Mitch Bolt. The current site consists of a rather large parcel that was previously improved with a one-story Pizza Hut restaurant and a surface parking lot.

That restaurant has been vacant now for several years. The applicant is proposing to redevelop the site in its entirety with a one-story convenience store that will be occupied by 711 and a one-story retail office building. When the applicant went in to submit a permit application for both of those buildings, it was first brought to our attention that a very small portion of the parcel is zoned M12.

It's actually the part of the parcel that will contain the onsite parking for the two new buildings. As a result of that non-conforming condition, the permits were put on hold and we were directed to file a zoning change to bring the split zoning into a unified B32 zoning district which will permit the new improvements and also cure the non-conforming condition. As such, we are here today requesting that zoning change.

We have met with Alderman Waggis-Beth as well as reached out to the Bucktown Community Organization regarding the specifics of this property and the reason for the zoning change. And we do believe that we have the support of both Alderman Waggis-Beth and there has been no opposition from the Bucktown Community Organization of which we know. But I will certainly let Alderman Waggis-Beth speak to that effect.

[Speaker 1] (2:35:56 - 2:36:02)
Questions for council? Hearing none, Alderman Scott Waggis-Beth.

[Speaker 63] (2:36:03 - 2:36:20)
Thank you, Chairman Tunney. I do support this application as Ms. Barnes and Mr. Goltz have stated. It will allow us to move forward on the split zone site.

So I just ask for the committee's support for this ordinance at 1601 Northwestern. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:36:21 - 2:36:30)
Thank you, Alderman. Questions for the Alderman? I have one quick one.

Is it two buildings on this thing? So it's a 711 and what else?

[Speaker 11] (2:36:31 - 2:36:35)
It's gonna be an office retail building. We don't have a tenant yet.

[Speaker 1] (2:36:36 - 2:36:38)
And there'll be parking for?

[Speaker 11] (2:36:38 - 2:36:40)
35 parking spaces.

[Speaker 1] (2:36:40 - 2:36:54)
Great, thank you. Thank you. Okay, so any more questions, motion?

Alderman Ravois makes a motion, do pass. All those in favor?

[Speaker 11] (2:36:54 - 2:36:55)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (2:36:55 - 2:36:58)
Any opposed? Then you can tear the ayes, have it. Good luck.

[Speaker 11] (2:36:58 - 2:36:59)
Thank you so much.

[Speaker 42] (2:37:00 - 2:37:00)

We have met with Alderman Villegas. We do have a letter of support. And I'm prepared to answer any questions you have.

Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My name is Pericles Abasi. I'm representing Mr. Paul Iquidel, who is seated beside me. He's the applicant and the owner of the property. We're seeking this increase in density to allow Mr. Iquidel to obtain a Department of Building permits to legalize an existing third dwelling unit in the basement of the building. No changes are gonna be made to the structure of the building.

And after the change, it'll be three legal units instead of two. At the request of Alderman Mitts, we attended her September community meeting. We presented to the community, they supported it, and we have a letter of support from Alderman Mitts, which you should have in your file.

[Speaker 1] (2:40:23 - 2:41:16)
We do have a letter. All right, any questions for the applicant? As I said, we have a letter from Alderman Mitts.

[Speaker 8] (2:41:16 - 2:42:02)
Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, my name is Mark Kupiec. I'm an attorney with offices at 77 West Washington. Represent the applicant, Chris Roszkowski, seated beside me.

Subject property is already developed with a two-story mixed-use building. And the project, the rezoning would allow him to build a third floor addition. And a third floor addition would contain two additional dwelling units for a total of four.

Chris spoke with Alderman Sposato. At Alderman's request, it was a community meeting at a local park. No objectors showed up at the meeting.

And we followed up with Alderman Sposato. And I do believe he had sent a letter in support of the application.

[Speaker 1] (2:42:03 - 2:42:15)
We do have that letter of support from Alderman Sposato. Anything else? That's it.

Questions for the applicant. Quick question, how many parking spaces?

[Speaker 8] (2:42:18 - 2:42:23)
Six parking spaces. Okay, I didn't see that on the narrative. Yeah, I'm sorry.

It's a double lot.

[Speaker 1] (2:42:24 - 2:42:38)
Great, okay. Can I get a motion to move do pass on this item? Alderman Osterman moves do pass on the item.

All those in favor? Aye, any opposed? Can you chair the ayes have it, item is passed.

[Speaker 8] (2:42:38 - 2:42:39)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:42:39 - 2:43:02)
And we're gonna move on also in the 38th ward to document number 20185. Ordinance referred on September 18th of this year. Common address 6101 West Montrose Avenue.

Change request. RS3 residential single unit detached house district to a B2-1 neighborhood mixed use district.

[Speaker 21] (2:43:03 - 2:44:00)
Councilor. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman. My name is Paul Colpac.

I represent the applicant Mitchell Moore who owns the property in question. We're requesting the zoning change from the RS3 residential single unit detached house district to that of the B2-1 neighborhood mixed use district to convert the existing one story building to a hardware store which will be approximately 1,270 square feet with one rear dwelling unit. Well, the property was currently utilized as a neighborhood tavern.

So it was a non-conforming use in the RS3 district. We're basically retrofitting that building to allow the hardware store and the property owner would like to have a dwelling unit in the rear. Therefore, that's the reason for the B2-1.

We met with Alderman Sposada. We do have a letter of support on file.

[Speaker 1] (2:44:02 - 2:44:19)
So question for me is, so the existing, was it a tavern at one point? It was a tavern at one time. And was there a rear dwelling unit?

No, there was not. Okay, so now we're gonna have a small hardware store. Correct.

One, okay.

[Speaker 21] (2:44:20 - 2:44:20)
With one bunch.

[Speaker 1] (2:44:21 - 2:44:43)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Sposada. Any questions? Can I have a motion moved to pass on this item?

Alderman Kappelman moves to pass on this item. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Opinion chair, the ayes have it and the item is passed.

[Speaker 21] (2:44:43 - 2:44:44)
Thank you very much for your consideration.

[Speaker 1] (2:44:45 - 2:45:13)
Now the next two items I'll read them into the record are going to be deferred and they're deferred by the attorneys. So that will be item number 20186, document number 020196849, and I'll take them together, will be deferred at the request of the attorney. Well, no, I'll take that separately because we have a separate attorney.

[Speaker 21] (2:45:15 - 2:45:24)
The attorney, one son, Kim, since we were gonna defer, asked me to ask for the deferral on her behalf today since I would be here.

[Speaker 1] (2:45:24 - 2:46:03)
Okay, can I get a motion to defer on that item? Alderman Roboius moves to defer. All, item is deferred.

Let's go on to the next one. That's document 20187T1 in 38th Ward at 6334, through 38 West Irving Park. So can I get a motion to defer that item?

Alderman Roboius moves to defer and therefore this item is deferred.

[Speaker 21] (2:46:03 - 2:46:04)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (2:46:05 - 2:46:37)
For attorneys on both of them. Top of page 18. Okay, document number 20137 in 40th Ward, ordinance referred on 918 of 19.

Common address, 2150 West Foster Avenue, the change request, RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district.

[Speaker 70] (2:46:39 - 2:46:39)
Mr. Moore.

[Speaker 24] (2:46:40 - 2:47:16)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name for the record is Thomas S. Moore.

With me today is Mr. Daniel Ward. He and his wife, Jerry, own this property and their plan is to build a three-flat here that they would live in a duplex on the bottom and rent out two units. And we had a community meeting.

The community liked the idea of putting density on Foster, which is a busier street rather than the side streets. And we had the community group support and we have a letter of support from the alderman and we request your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (2:47:18 - 2:47:40)
So we do have a letter from Alderman Vasquez. Questions for the applicant? Hearing no questions, do I have a motion by Alderman Osterman, moves do pass on this item.

All those in favor? Aye, any opposed? Opinion chair, the ayes have it and this item is passed.

[Speaker 24] (2:47:41 - 2:47:41)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (2:47:42 - 2:48:04)
Now we're staying on page 18, document number 20148 in the 40th ward, ordinance referred on 918 of 19, common address 5100 through 08 Northwestern Avenue, change request, B32 community shopping district to a B23 neighborhood mixed use district.

[Speaker 8] (2:48:05 - 2:48:59)
Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, my name is Mark Kupiec. I'm an attorney with offices of 77 West Washington, represent the applicant and I have with me on behalf of the applicant, Sander Karen seated beside me. Subject property is improved with a commercial building.

Used to be an old bar or restaurant. I've been vacant for, I'm told maybe two years or more. The plan calls to demolish this existing building and a little gas, strike that auto repair shop next door and build a new building, mixed use building, 24 dwelling units.

This was, we would like to amend our application and proceed as a type one. We did submit a plan, type one plans, a narrative to the zoning department and if one of the committee members would be good enough, we'd like to amend it and proceed as a type one.

[Speaker 1] (2:49:00 - 2:49:12)
So Alderman Lopez moves to amend the application to a type one application. All those in favor? Aye, any opposed?

Hearing none, the type one application is in front of us.

[Speaker 8] (2:49:12 - 2:49:33)
So the applicant started work with the Alderman's staff. Alderman requested a community meeting, did a community meeting, had a large, large turnout and in response, is it, good, yeah, property's at the corner of Western and Carmen.

[Speaker 1] (2:49:34 - 2:49:35)
Western and where?

[Speaker 8] (2:49:36 - 2:49:36)
Carmen.

[Speaker 1] (2:49:37 - 2:49:37)
Carmen.

[Speaker 8] (2:49:37 - 2:50:35)
Carmen, corner building. And in response to some of the comments from the community, originally, the subject site is on Western Avenue, so this is a transit serve location. Originally, we were gonna take a parking reduction, also right down the street from the Western Avenue station on the Brown Line.

However, the community members thought that parking was still difficult in the neighborhood and they encouraged us to provide more parking. So instead of taking a parking reduction, we did change the plan and are providing one-to-one parking for the 24 units because the community thought it would be a good idea. So that's part of the amended plan that we submitted with the 24 parking spaces.

So with that plan, with the one-to-one parking, followed up with the Alderman and staff and I do believe that the Alderman had sent you his letter of support.

[Speaker 1] (2:50:36 - 2:50:40)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Vasquez.

[Speaker 41] (2:50:44 - 2:50:45)
Questions?

[Speaker 1] (2:50:46 - 2:50:48)
Quick questions. Oh, Alderman also mentioned.

[Speaker 41] (2:50:49 - 2:51:07)
Thank you. The question is affordable units on site. Is the owner gonna provide under the ARO ordinance affordable units on site?

Carmelo, did you address that? Yes, we are.

[Speaker 8] (2:51:07 - 2:51:11)
Identify yourself for the record. My name's Sander Caron and yes, we're gonna have it on site.

[Speaker 64] (2:51:14 - 2:51:20)
We're thinking two, 10%. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:51:25 - 2:51:28)
Two units, Stephen.

[Speaker 38] (2:51:30 - 2:51:37)
Ziano, Department of Planning and Development. The actual requirement would be three affordable units based on the ARO ordinance.

[Speaker 1] (2:51:39 - 2:51:47)
So three, so then we'll do three. Then we'll do three. Okay.

Thank you for clarifying that. All of them in Osterman.

[Speaker 41] (2:51:49 - 2:51:54)
If we're gonna go up to three, why not four or five or six? I'm kidding.

[Speaker 1] (2:51:54 - 2:52:24)
Oh my God. Thank you. For a conversation later this fall or the first part of next year, I think.

Thank you for your questions and comments. Can I have a motion to move? The move do pass as amended to a type one.

Alderman Lopez moves do pass as amended. Type one application. All those in favor?

Any opposed? Opinions here, the ayes have it and good luck to you.

[Speaker 8] (2:52:24 - 2:52:24)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:52:25 - 2:52:28)
What was on the site? Tavern and what? The bar restaurant.

[Speaker 8] (2:52:29 - 2:52:40)
Oh, I heard. Did you say a mechanic's place too? Two properties.

There was a bar restaurant. I forget the name of it. Bubba's Bar Restaurant.

[Speaker 1] (2:52:40 - 2:52:42)
Where Boy is hanged out there.

[Speaker 8] (2:52:42 - 2:52:50)
And then there was also a small auto repair shop on a single lot with a driveway onto Western, which will be abandoned with the new project.

[Speaker 1] (2:52:51 - 2:53:10)
All right. Thank you very much. Thank you.

Moving on. Okay. I'm gonna ask.

Let's see what. Okay. I'm gonna yield.

It's in the 44th Ward to Alderman Vice Chair Raboias.

[Speaker 14] (2:53:17 - 2:54:02)
So much growling, man. All right, item on page 20, number 20182 in the 44th Ward. And the referred ordinance from September 18, 2019 document number 02019-6858, common address 3542 North Southport Avenue.

The applicant CA residential 3542 North Southport LLC, attorney law offices of Sandbanks. For the record, name for the record.

[Speaker 5] (2:54:03 - 2:54:53)
Thank you. Nicholas Fatikas again from the law offices of Sandbanks here on behalf of the applicant and property owner CA residential 3542 North Southport LLC. We are seeking a zoning change from the underlining B3-2 zoning to a B3-3 zoning district.

We're proposing a four story mixed use building with a retail space at grade and three residential units above. The property is located within 1320 linear feet of the Southport Brownline Station. So we are providing two onsite parking spaces to serve the building pursuant to transit oriented development ordinance.

We've worked with the Sheffield neighbors, I'm sorry, the Southport neighbors, as well as Alderman Tunney's office and we've asked for his support for today's proceeding.

[Speaker 14] (2:54:54 - 2:54:55)
So it's three dwelling units?

[Speaker 5] (2:54:56 - 2:55:11)
Three dwelling units over a retail. And as a matter of housekeeping, we did convert this as a transit oriented development application to a type one. So I'd ask that the type one plans, narrative and ordinance be incorporated into today's proceeding.

[Speaker 14] (2:55:13 - 2:55:22)
Questions, questions for the applicants? Alderman Osterman, what's there today?

[Speaker 24] (2:55:25 - 2:55:44)
My name is Jack Duncan with CA residential 3542, the ownership. It was previously a two story dwelling with retail salon on below grade. We are bringing it to grade level, putting a retail on the ground floor with three residential units above.

So it's currently a demolished site.

[Speaker 14] (2:55:45 - 2:55:54)
Thanks. Questions? It's the Alderman in support of, is there a letter on file?

[Speaker 73] (2:55:58 - 2:56:03)
For Alderman Tunney, the Alderman is in support of the project. And I believe he is in the back if you have any questions for him.

[Speaker 14] (2:56:04 - 2:56:42)
Thank you, Alderman Beal. Thank you. All right.

Yeah, no, it's not until maybe after lunch. Okay. No questions, so moved by Alderman Beal, all in favor?

All in favor? All opposed? And opinion chairs, the ayes have it.

Thank you, sir. Thank you. The third item, which one?

One more? The one with the lunch, right?

[Speaker 41] (2:56:43 - 2:56:44)
Very good.

[Speaker 60] (2:56:44 - 2:56:52)
One more? Pretty good, man.

[Speaker 14] (2:56:56 - 2:57:41)
All right, getting back to the referred items on page 26, item number 20020-, type one ordinance, 44th Ward. Ordinance referred on April 10th, 2019. Document number 0219-3119.

Common address 3131-3141 North Sheffield. Applicant is Fletcher Lofts, LLC, as well as the owner, Attorney Jack Perino. And the change request is B2-5 Neighborhood Mixed Use District to a B2-5 Neighborhood Mixed Use District.

Name for the record.

[Speaker 73] (2:57:42 - 2:58:25)
Good afternoon. My name is Talar Berberian from the Law Offices of Thompson-Coburn. I'm here with Bob Purcell from the applicant Fletcher Lofts, LLC.

This request is for rezoning to the same district, B2-5, which was required because we're adding six units to the ground floor of this building where commercial space was initially proposed. The six units are permitted in the underlying zoning and they're permitted in the B2 to be on the ground floor. The addition of the six units will require a further reduction by the type one for parking spaces.

There are currently 40 parking spaces serving the building.

[Speaker 14] (2:58:26 - 2:58:37)
And the property is in a transit-oriented development area? And how many parking spaces was that? 40, for a total of 40 spaces?

[Speaker 73] (2:58:37 - 2:58:43)
40 spaces serving the building, yes.

[Speaker 14] (2:58:45 - 2:58:48)
Any questions from the attorney? Alderman Osterman.

[Speaker 41] (2:58:50 - 2:58:54)
Yeah, question about affordable housing. If the units are gonna be on site?

[Speaker 73] (2:58:56 - 2:59:13)
The project does not require, it's not subject to the affordable housing ordinance because the initial building was built with the underlying zoning. And the current proposal is simply to add six units. So the addition of six units will not trigger the affordable housing ordinance.

[Speaker 14] (2:59:14 - 2:59:20)
Thank you. Any other questions? Any motion?

Alderman Tunney.

[Speaker 73] (2:59:27 - 2:59:30)
Yes, the affordable housing ordinance was complied with in the first round.

[Speaker 1] (2:59:31 - 3:00:34)
There was a portable on this. This was a conversion from a storage building, Anderson Brothers, right by the train there. So the issue is it's right next to the Vic Theater.

And for a couple of years, we've been trying to get a commercial tenant on the ground floor. But with all the activity around the concert venue, you can hardly even get in front of the place on a concert night. So there's no way to get people in and out.

So after years of trying to market it unsuccessfully, they've come back to convert that commercial use into residential. So they all met with the community group. They got about 80% of the requests, not 100%.

But after about a year of working with the neighborhood group, I think we need to move forward on it with substantial compliance. And I'm happy to support it. I see this building every day of my life and know the activity around the Vic as you do all the chairman reports.

[Speaker 14] (3:00:34 - 3:00:43)
I know the area very well, yeah. So I ask your move to pass on it. Thanks, Alderman Tunney.

Any questions for Alderman Tunney? A point of clarification, Alderman Beal.

[Speaker 16] (3:00:44 - 3:00:58)
Attorney, so you said when this was initially built, it had the affordable housing piece component in it. And so just adding it. So it's not that we're opting out, that it was already there.

They're not opting out. Okay, I got it. Thank you.

Wanted to be clear.

[Speaker 14] (3:00:59 - 3:01:17)
Any other questions? Move to pass by Alderman Lopez. All in favor?

Aye. All opposed? And none.

Chairs have it. Steve, Mr. Valenciano, can you comment on that?

[Speaker 38] (3:01:17 - 3:01:44)
Yeah, no. Steve Valenciano, Department of Planning and Development. I just wanted to make a point of clarification.

I misspoke on case 20148 in the 40th Ward, 5100 to 08 Northwestern Avenue. Under the 2019 ARO ordinance revisions, there are only two affordable units required, not three. So I just wanted to make that a clarification.

It doesn't change the case at all. I just wanted to clarify that for the record. Thank you, sir.

[Speaker 65] (3:02:21 - 3:02:22)
All right, wait, wait, wait, wait.

[Speaker 31] (3:02:23 - 3:02:23)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (3:02:34 - 3:02:54)
Okay, bottom of page 20. Document number 20188, 46th Ward, ordinance referred on September 18th of 19. Common address, 4635 through 37 North Broadway Avenue, and the change request, B23 Neighborhood Mixed Use District to a B33 Community Shopping District.

[Speaker 5] (3:02:55 - 3:03:34)
Nick? Good afternoon. Again, Chairman, for the record, Nick Fetikas from the Law Offices of Sam Banks.

I'm here on behalf of the applicant and property owner, 4635 Broadway, LLC. The applicant is seeking a zoning change at the subject property to permit the location and establishment of a packaged goods, in this case, a specialty wine and spirit store on the first floor of the property. Current zoning doesn't allow the packaged goods use.

The B3 does with a special use. So we've worked with Alderman Kaplan's office. We also hosted a community meeting to explain the operations, and we believe we have support for the zoning change to proceed.

[Speaker 1] (3:03:37 - 3:03:44)
Thank you, Nick. Questions for the applicant? Alderman Kaplan, would you like to opine on it?

[Speaker 13] (3:03:47 - 3:04:13)
The landlord and the business owner met with our community. Actually, at first, they were a little hesitant, but after some great discussions there, the area residents, there was a consensus very supportive of it. So were the surrounding business.

There's a restaurant that will be located next door. We'll also utilize this. It will put more life on the streets.

So I ask my colleagues to support it.

[Speaker 1] (3:04:14 - 3:04:33)
Thank you, Alderman. Questions for the Alderman or applicant? Hearing none, can I have a motion moved to pass, please?

Alderman Lopez moves to pass on the application. All those in favor? Any opposed?

Hearing none, the item is passed. Thank you very much. Good luck.

What's the wine store?

[Speaker 42] (3:04:34 - 3:04:48)
Pops and Grapes. Have you had a store before? I have not had a store in my buildings, but the owner has many stores throughout the area of Chicago.

Great, nice addition to the 46th Ward.

[Speaker 1] (3:04:48 - 3:05:16)
All right, good luck to you. All right, we are here. Top of page 21.

Again, in the 46th Ward, document number 20192-T1. Ordinance referred September 18th of 19. Common address, 1039 West Lawrence Avenue and the change request to B33 Community Shopping District to a B35 Community Shopping District.

[Speaker 5] (3:05:19 - 3:06:15)
Counselor? Thank you again for the record. Nick Petekas from the Law Offices of Sam Banks.

I'm here again on behalf of the applicant and property owner, Lawrence Lofts, LLC. The applicant is proposing to convert what used to be 161 room, single room occupancy building to an 80 unit development, residential development. The resulting units will have 72 efficiency units and eight typical dwelling units.

The size and height of the building will remain without change. We are located within 1,320, actually within 660 feet of the entrance to the Lawrence Redline Station. And the applicant is seeking a parking reduction to a total of seven units of parking to support the building.

We've worked with, again, Alderman Kapleman's office as well as a hosted community meeting regarding the proposal. We believe we have support to move forward at this time.

[Speaker 1] (3:06:18 - 3:06:27)
Questions for the applicant? I will wait until we hear from Alderman Kapleman.

[Speaker 13] (3:06:27 - 3:07:46)
Thank you. This is a building where the units were not allowed to have hot plates or microwaves because of the need for electrical upgrades. The building had been for sale for over six years.

No takers from the not-for-profits wanted it unless the owner was willing to sell it for $1, which he's not able to do because of money owed on the building. The building needs all new mechanicals and must now comply with the city's life safety ordinance. Non-profits were not able to purchase it without heavy city subsidies that never materialized.

The local block club voted in favor of this upzone. It was unanimous. That almost never occurs.

It may have occurred one time, ever. In the 46th Ward in eight years, I've been Alderman. And while I fully appreciate the need to preserve SROs, the fact of the matter is that the cost to preserve one 250-square-foot SRO unit is the same as the cost to preserve an efficiency, a studio, one or two-bedroom apartment.

And therefore, I'd like to focus on maintaining affordable housing in larger units as well. So with that, I ask my colleagues to support the vote of the block club for this upzone.

[Speaker 1] (3:07:47 - 3:08:08)
Thank you. Alderman questions for Alderman Kapleman. Just one quick question.

Maybe you don't have the answer, but maybe you know. So SRO preservation, we spent a lot of time in this council over the years. So what is the financial cost?

I'm assuming you're opting out of the SRO.

[Speaker 5] (3:08:08 - 3:08:43)
Correct. Elaborate on that. The SRO occupants have actually been relocated.

So the building currently sits vacant for the intended conversion. So we complied with and actually worked with the law department to make sure that we were in compliance with the SRO relocation program that council put into effect. So we followed those rules to a point where we're vacant.

And then as a part of this zoning change, 10%, so eight of the proposed units, will remain affordable and they will be provided on site.

[Speaker 1] (3:08:44 - 3:08:48)
So how many of the previous residents had to be relocated?

[Speaker 5] (3:08:50 - 3:08:52)
The answer was over 100.

[Speaker 1] (3:08:52 - 3:08:56)
And I'm not as fully cognizant of the cost of that. What was that cost?

[Speaker 38] (3:08:57 - 3:08:58)
It was over 600.

[Speaker 1] (3:09:02 - 3:09:13)
Other questions? Got a motion move to pass on the item? Motion to pass on it?

Alderman Osterman moves to pass on the item. All those in favor?

[Speaker 5] (3:09:14 - 3:09:14)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (3:09:14 - 3:09:17)
Aye, any opposed? Senator in the chair, the ayes have it.

[Speaker 5] (3:09:18 - 3:09:18)
Thank you, sir.

[Speaker 1] (3:09:19 - 3:09:45)
All right, now moving to the middle of page 21. Document number 20150-T1 in the 47th Ward, ordinance referred on September 18th of 19. Common address, 3914 North Hermitage Avenue and the change request, RS3, residential single unit, detached house to an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district.

[Speaker 75] (3:09:46 - 3:10:53)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Tyler Manick of the Shane Banks Law Firm. I'm here on behalf of Michael Kretsch, who's sitting next to me, the homeowner of the property located at 3914 North Hermitage.

The applicant seeks to rezone 3914 North Hermitage from an RS3 to the RT4 zoning district in order to renovate the existing ground floor space in order to add an additional dwelling unit for a total of three dwelling units and three parking spaces. Mr. Kretsch will reside with his family in one of the units. Prior to filing this application, Mr. Kretsch and I met with Alderman Martin and his zoning advisory council and also shared our plans with the Westlake View neighbors. And I believe based on those meetings, we have the full support of each of those groups, including a letter of support from Alderman Martin that was given to the committee this morning. Based on the support we've received to date, we respectfully request that this committee favorably recommend to rezone 3914 North Hermitage to an RT4 district and we'd be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (3:10:55 - 3:10:58)
So do we have a substitute?

[Speaker 75] (3:10:59 - 3:11:04)
Oh, and we have a substitute plans that I would like to move to amend our application.

[Speaker 1] (3:11:04 - 3:11:43)
So Alderman Kappelman moves to accept the substantive narrative and plans for this type one application. All those in favor? Aye, any opposed?

This item is substituted before us. Mm-hmm. Now, questions?

Questions for, okay. Hearing no questions, Alderman Lopez moves to pass with the substitute narrative and plans. All those in favor?

Aye, any opposed? Opinion of the chair, the item has passed with substitute narrative and plans.

[Speaker 75] (3:11:43 - 3:11:44)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (3:11:44 - 3:12:07)
All right, staying on page 21, the bottom, number 20154 in the 47th Ward, the ordinance referred on September 18th of 19, common address 4646 through 50, North Damon Avenue and the change request, a B23 neighborhood mixed use district to a C13 neighborhood commercial district.

[Speaker 11] (3:12:23 - 3:14:28)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. Once again, for the record, my name is Sarah Barnes and I'm an attorney with the Lofts, this is Sam Banks. I'm happy to be here this afternoon on behalf of the applicant, 4646 Damon LLC.

It may have remembered us from before. We've actually been before this committee two other times for this particular property, once back in February of 2017 and again in October of 2017. And that was in order to permit the development of a new four-story mixed use building, which will contain commercial and office use at grade level and 24 dwelling units above.

Happy to report back to the committee that since that time, permits have been pulled for the new building and it's almost completely constructed pursuant to those permits. During construction, however, the applicant was approached by a very well-admired veterinary clinic within the city who wants to put an office, a third office in the existing building. So as a result, and unfortunately, the underlying B2 zoning did not support a veterinary use.

So we are here today seeking to change the subject zoning to a C1 zoning district, which will allow the establishment of a veterinary clinic within the existing building. So this zoning change is solely for the use, the physicality of the building will not change in any way. The proposed veterinary clinic will occupy the entire retail office space of the grade level of the building.

With that, we have met with Alderman Martin. We've also met with the Lincoln Square Chamber of Commerce regarding this proposal. And we do have a letter of support from Alderman Martin that has been tendered to the committee prior to this hearing.

If there's any questions, we'd be very happy to answer.

[Speaker 1] (3:14:29 - 3:14:41)
Great, questions for the applicant? Hearing no questions, we do have a letter of support from Alderman Martin. Can I get a motion to move to pass on this item?

[Speaker 31] (3:14:42 - 3:14:42)
I'll move.

[Speaker 1] (3:14:42 - 3:14:53)
Alderman Caplan moves to pass on this item. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Opinion of the Chair of the Ayes have it. And the veterinary clinic is moving to Damon.

[Speaker 11] (3:14:53 - 3:14:54)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:14:55 - 3:15:22)
Good luck. All right, page 22. 47th Ward, document number 2155, referred on September 18th of this year, 19.

Address 4311 Northwestern Avenue and the change request of B32 Community Shopping District to B23 Neighborhood Mixed Use District. Counselor.

[Speaker 11] (3:15:22 - 3:16:49)
Thank you again, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. One last time for the record. My name is Sarah Barnes and I'm an attorney with the lobsters of Sam Bank.

I'm here this afternoon on behalf of the applicant, JC Construction LLC. Here with me is the managing member of the applicant, Jerry Heffernan. Mr. Heffernan would like to redevelop the subject site with a new four-story, four-unit all-residential building. The proposed new building will have interior parking for two vehicles located below grade as well as surface parking for two vehicles so that each of the new dwelling units will have a designated parking space. We have met with Alderman Martin as well as with the Lincoln Square Neighbor Association and the 47th Ward Zoning Advisory Committee to review this proposal. Based on the feedback that we received during those meetings, we made some design tweaks and have also incorporated permeable materials throughout the site as a concession to the local community organization.

As a result of those changes, we do have the full support of Alderman Martin as well as the Lincoln Square Neighbor Association. Towards that end, I do believe that Alderman Martin's office emailed a copy of a letter of support to your office prior to this hearing, but we would be very happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (3:16:50 - 3:17:12)
Great, we did receive an email in support of this project. Questions for the applicant? No questions.

Alderman Roboyes, can I get a motion to move to pass on this one? Alderman Roboyes moves to pass on this item. All those in favor?

Aye. Aye, any opposed? Convening Chair, the ayes have it.

Item is passed. Thank you very much.

[Speaker 11] (3:17:12 - 3:17:13)
Thank you once more.

[Speaker 1] (3:17:14 - 3:17:42)
Staying on page 22, document number 20174 in the 48th Ward, ordinance referred on September 18th of this year, 19. Common address 5524 through 5530 North Magnolia Avenue. Change request RS3, residential single unit detached house district to an RT4, residential two-flat and multi-unit district.

[Speaker 54] (3:17:43 - 3:18:31)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. Again, for the record, Katrina McGuire from Thompson-Coburn. Here on behalf of the applicant, Jab Merger LLC.

With me today are Jim Jan of Jab Merger and to his right, Sarah Rindle from Space Architects and Planners. We are seeking to rezone this property from RS3 to RT4 for the purpose of converting the former St. Ida's Convent into eight dwelling units with eight parking spaces. This is a building that has sat vacant for I believe over a decade and with both the design of the project and our engagement with the community, we believe that it is a wonderful adaptive reuse of the existing structure.

Alderman Osterman is here as well and we are hopeful that he supports the project.

[Speaker 1] (3:18:34 - 3:18:48)
All right, I must say, I can't believe the project or the building was vacant for 10 years. It's such a handsome building. Questions for the applicant before we hear from Alderman Osterman?

Alderman?

[Speaker 41] (3:18:51 - 3:19:33)
Well, I think it's fitting. We started earlier with a funeral home and we're gonna end with a convent, but in all seriousness, this project has sat vacant for 10 years and for 10 years, everything under the sun has been proposed there. I think this proposal for development is a very reasonable residential development in a very residential part of our community in Lakewood-Belmoral.

It'll preserve this building, which is important for the community. We held a community meeting on this and the majority of the neighbors are in support as am I. So I would ask my colleagues to support this.

[Speaker 1] (3:19:34 - 3:19:53)
Questions for Alderman Osterman? Hearing no questions. I have a motion from Alderman Lopez.

He moves to pass on this item. All those in favor? Aye.

Aye. Any opposed? Hearing none, the item is passed and congratulations.

Thank you.

[Speaker 54] (3:19:54 - 3:20:04)
What's the size of the lot? 12,300 feet. Eight units, beautiful.

[Speaker 1] (3:20:06 - 3:20:39)
Thank you. Congratulations, Alderman. All right, next item is bottom of page 22.

Document number 20136, 50th Ward. Ordinance referred on September 18th of 19. Common address, 219 West Tuey Avenue.

Change request, RS3, residential single unit detached house district to an RT3.5 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district.

[Speaker 18] (3:20:41 - 3:20:42)
Mr. Moore.

[Speaker 24] (3:20:42 - 3:21:42)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name for the record is Thomas S. Moore and with me today is the owner, Mr. Cornel Tibu. Mr. Tibu, this is a very large lot. It has 8,500 ground square feet and normally at 2,500 square feet per unit, you could have a three-flat there, but an RS3 does not allow, it only allows two units maximum. So by going to a RT3.5, he can add the third unit in the basement. And we had a community meeting at Alderman Silverstein's office. We had all of the immediate neighbors show up and when they understood the project, they supported it and Alderman Silverstein has indicated her support as well. And we'd ask for your support.

[Speaker 1] (3:21:42 - 3:22:45)
We do have an email support from Alderman Silverstein and do we have any questions for the applicant? I don't see any questions. Can I get a motion to move on this item?

Alderman Osterman. Moves do pass. All those in favor?

Aye. And there are any opposed? Hearing none, item is passed.

Thank you very much. Now we are on the deferred agenda, correct? Okay.

Top of page 23, document number 20102 in the 12th ward, ordinance is referred on July 24th of 19, common address 2900 through 02, West Pershing Road. The change request, RS3, residential single unit detached house district to an RT4 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district. Mr. Pekarsky.

[Speaker 31] (3:22:45 - 3:23:47)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My name is John Pekarsky. And with me today is Mr. Yao Lin, who is seated to my right, who's the owner of the property in question. It is a situation that we've all faced frequently, creating a zoning lot out of two formerly lots of record. We would like to peel off the vacant lot, which is at the corner of Pershing and Francisco, build a single family home there. And legalize the existing building, which is on the lot immediately adjacent.

We have met with the alderman. We have also agreed that we will create a restrictive covenant that'll be placed against the property so as to allow the improvement with only a single family dwelling.

[Speaker 24] (3:23:48 - 3:23:49)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:23:49 - 3:24:09)
Thank you, councilor. Any other questions for the applicants? Hearing no questions, Alderman Roboyes, can I have a motion to move to pass on this item?

Alderman Roboyes moves to pass on this item. All those in favor? Aye, any opposed?

Then you and the chair of the ayes have it. Item is passed.

[Speaker 31] (3:24:09 - 3:24:10)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (3:24:10 - 3:24:46)
Thank you, John. Bottom of page 23. Bottom of page 23, document 19771, 17th Ward.

Ordinance is referred on July 25th of 18, actually. Been a while on this one. Address, 1223 West Marquette Road.

Change request, Institutional Residential Plan Development number 378 as amended to Institutional Residential Plan Development number 378 as amended again, I guess.

[Speaker 40] (3:24:47 - 3:25:25)
Okay, Paul's here. Good morning. On this one?

Yes, or good afternoon, Mr. Chairman. My name is Paul Schadel with the law firm of DLA Piper and with my colleague Liz Butler represent the applicant, the Interfaith Housing Development Corporation of Chicago, which is the applicant for this amendment to the existing plan development. With us are Perry Vietti, the president of Interfaith, and Rich Klein of Weiss Langley Weiss Architects, the project architect.

This request for an amendment was considered and recommended for approval by the Plan Commission on September 19th and we'd request that the transcript and resolution from that hearing be incorporated into the record today.

[Speaker 1] (3:25:27 - 3:25:36)
Alderman Capelman moves to incorporate the records from the Plan Commission. All in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Hearing none, the records are now incorporated.

[Speaker 40] (3:25:36 - 3:26:29)
Thank you. The subject property is currently improved with an existing three-story building. It's owned and operated by the Human Resource Development Institute as a transitional residence.

That program is, the program currently operated in the property is in the process of being moved to another property in Human Resource Development Institute's portfolio and as a result, this subject property will be vacant at the end of this year. And as a result, the applicant, Interfaith, is under contract to purchase the property and intends to repurpose it with high-quality, permanent supportive housing of 25 studio apartments and 100% of those units will be affordable. And for that reason, we're seeking to amend the plan development to facilitate this adaptive reuse of the existing buildings.

We're available to answer any questions that you have, but would respectfully request your positive recommendation.

[Speaker 1] (3:26:32 - 3:26:45)
Paul, just, I probably wasn't listening as quickly or you were talking too fast, so. My apology. Currently, or what was on the site, it was approved and then they've left and now we're doing this permanent supportive housing.

[Speaker 40] (3:26:46 - 3:27:10)
Precisely, Alderman. So it's owned and operated today by this Human Resource Development Institute which is closing its transitional residence project at this location, relocating it to another location and Interfaith proposes to repurpose, adaptively reuse the site for these 25 units of supportive housing. And we do have the support of the local Alderman.

Yeah, yeah, okay, that's great.

[Speaker 1] (3:27:10 - 3:27:11)
But same number of units is the thing?

[Speaker 22] (3:27:12 - 3:27:46)
Actually, me, Perry, you could describe what was there before and the number of units that you'll be in. It really wasn't units. Oh, it's Perry Vietti, the President of Interfaith Housing Development Corporation.

It really wasn't a residential structure. It was a programmatic, it was a program. So they had just rooms and we're gonna provide apartments there.

So it's not really considered, in our world of affordable housing, it's not really considered a unit. You know, a residential unit is considered a bed, essentially. Transitional bed, correct.

[Speaker 40] (3:27:48 - 3:27:52)
Perry, can you describe what those transitional beds will be replaced with under your program?

[Speaker 22] (3:27:52 - 3:27:57)
So it's gonna be 25 studio apartments, full kitchens, full baths, regular apartment units.

[Speaker 1] (3:27:58 - 3:28:02)
Okay, and the transitional is moving to another location?

[Speaker 22] (3:28:02 - 3:28:08)
Yes, independent of us. They had the building on the market and that's why we pursued it. Questions?

[Speaker 1] (3:28:09 - 3:28:10)
Questions of the applicant?

[Speaker 13] (3:28:11 - 3:28:13)
Do we have a letter of support?

[Speaker 65] (3:28:20 - 3:28:21)
We do.

[Speaker 1] (3:28:21 - 3:28:37)
Okay, so there is a letter of support from Alderman Moore. Questions? Hearing no questions, can I get a motion to move to pass on this one?

Alderman Roboius moves to pass as revised. All those in favor?

[Speaker 13] (3:28:37 - 3:28:38)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (3:28:38 - 3:28:44)
Any opposed? Opposed? Chair, the ayes have it and this item is passed as revised.

[Speaker 67] (3:28:45 - 3:28:46)
Thank you. Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (3:28:50 - 3:29:27)
Now we're on the middle of page 25. Okay, so item number 20093-T1 in the 35th Ward, ordinance referred on July 24th of 19. Common address, 2200 North Keeler and 4200 West Palmer, Keeler Avenue and Palmer Street.

Change request, RS3, residential single unit detached house district to an RM5, residential multi-unit district. All right.

[Speaker 5] (3:29:29 - 3:30:13)
Counselor. Thank you. For the record, Nick Fetikas from the Law Offices of Sam Banks.

I'm here on behalf of the applicant and property owner, Mr. Daniel Tanoco. The applicant is proposing to bring an existing basement unit for compliance with the zoning ordinance. The existing building has four legal units and again, the unpermitted basement unit.

The resulting structure will have five code compliant residential units. There are no proposed changes to the FAR height or setbacks of the existing structure. Again, all of the compliance work will be done within the existing four walls.

As a matter of background, we did file substitute narrative and plans and I asked that the substitute narrative plans, narrative and plans be incorporated into today's proceeding.

[Speaker 1] (3:30:15 - 3:30:26)
Alderman Kappelman moves to accept the substantive narrative and plans for this type one application. All those in favor? Any opposed?

Hearing none, the narrative and plans are accepted and before us.

[Speaker 5] (3:30:26 - 3:30:35)
Thank you, Chair. We worked with the Alderman Ramirez-Rosa and we do have a letter of support. I believe it was emailed, but I do have a copy if it's needed for the application.

[Speaker 1] (3:30:36 - 3:30:53)
We do have the support of Alderman Ramirez-Rosa. Thank you. Any questions?

Hearing none, Alderman Osterman moves to pass with substantive narrative and plans. All those in favor? Any opposed?

This item is passed with the substitute narrative and plans.

[Speaker 5] (3:30:53 - 3:30:54)
Thank you, sir.

[Speaker 1] (3:30:54 - 3:31:17)
Thank you. Bottom of page 25. Document number 20091, 40th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on July 24th of 19. Common address, 2763 West Lawrence Avenue and the change request, B12 Neighborhood Shopping District to a B23 Neighborhood Mixed Use District.

[Speaker 31] (3:31:18 - 3:31:58)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon. This afternoon, I represent Alan Coyle, seated to my right, who wishes to build a six-dwelling unit building at 2763 West Lawrence.

The property measures 27 frontage feet by 125 feet of depth. And we will be providing three onsite parking spaces. We have met with the alderman and with the community group on this matter and have the unequivocal support of both.

[Speaker 1] (3:32:01 - 3:32:03)
TOD, this is TOD, right?

[Speaker 31] (3:32:03 - 3:32:04)
Correct.

[Speaker 13] (3:32:04 - 3:32:05)
Okay, all right.

[Speaker 1] (3:32:08 - 3:32:10)
We've heard from Alderman Vesquez.

[Speaker 30] (3:32:10 - 3:32:12)
We do have his support.

[Speaker 1] (3:32:13 - 3:32:19)
All right, questions for this development from the attorney? We do have a letter of support from Alderman Vesquez.

[Speaker 64] (3:32:23 - 3:32:24)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (3:32:25 - 3:32:39)
So can I get a motion to move, do pass on this item? Alderman Osterman moves to pass on the item. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? The opinion of the chair, the ayes have it, item is passed.

[Speaker 31] (3:32:40 - 3:32:41)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (3:32:43 - 3:33:27)
Thank you. All right, now we're on to, all right. Top of page 26, item number 20117, 42nd Ward, ordinance referred on July 24th of 19, common address one through 39 West Wacker Drive, 200 to 240 North State, two through 40 West Lake Street, and 209 through 241 North Dearborn Street.

The change request business plan development number 381 to business plan development 381 as amended.

[Speaker 21] (3:33:28 - 3:33:51)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the board. My name is Paul Kulpac. I represent the African CWI Chicago Hotel LLC.

The property we met in front of the plan commission on September 19th, we had unanimous support of the plan commission, and I request that the exhibits and testimony be incorporated into this proceeding.

[Speaker 1] (3:33:52 - 3:34:02)
Alderman Kappelman moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Hearing none, the records are before us and incorporated.

[Speaker 21] (3:34:03 - 3:35:11)
The property in question houses the Renaissance Hotel. The purpose of the amendment to the plan development was to construct approximately 4,120 square feet of a financial institution in the sub area to where the hotel is located. The existing hotel will remain the same and add on 4,120 square feet for that financial institution.

We've been on this project for well over a year. Originally what happened when we looked at the underlying plan development, the numbers were all incorrect. We had to have a meeting with the planning department.

They agreed that the calculations that were done in the 80s were incorrect. Therefore, we were now allowed to, by deconverting some of our office space into mechanical rooms, we met the underlying FAR and went forward with that. We've got approval from CDOT.

The alderman, Riley, has been in support of this.

[Speaker 61] (3:35:12 - 3:35:13)
Great.

[Speaker 1] (3:35:15 - 3:35:28)
Do we have a letters? Yes, I think I was there with them at that. So I believe we have alderman Riley's support and we'll make sure of that.

[Speaker 42] (3:35:28 - 3:35:29)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:35:29 - 3:35:42)
Before the council meeting. The question was, I mean, I think there was one question. They had a term for the, isn't it the drop off area, which is now gonna be enclosed?

[Speaker 21] (3:35:43 - 3:35:45)
Yeah, this is our architect. Will you please state your name, please?

[Speaker 38] (3:35:46 - 3:36:05)
With DXU Architects. The existing Port Cachere would be converted into the new financial institution, reconfiguring the existing arrival and drop off of the guests to shorten that up and free up the space underneath, raise the restaurant and bar above the Port Cachere currently.

[Speaker 1] (3:36:06 - 3:36:09)
You're gonna take out the restaurant?

[Speaker 38] (3:36:09 - 3:36:12)
No, that is just above the space that we were gonna enclose.

[Speaker 2] (3:36:12 - 3:36:13)
You said raise, I thought.

[Speaker 38] (3:36:13 - 3:36:15)
That's the name of the bar.

[Speaker 2] (3:36:15 - 3:36:16)
All right, great.

[Speaker 38] (3:36:17 - 3:36:20)
All right. Questions, applicant?

[Speaker 1] (3:36:21 - 3:36:39)
We have a report from alderman Riley. We will confirm all those. Can I get a motion to move to pass on the item?

Alderman Wagesbeck moves to pass as revised on this item. Are you okay with that? Yes.

[Speaker 21] (3:36:40 - 3:36:41)
Okay. All those in favor?

[Speaker 1] (3:36:42 - 3:36:46)
Aye. Any opposed? Then you'd share the ayes have it and it's passed as revised.

[Speaker 21] (3:36:47 - 3:36:48)
Thank you very much for your time.

[Speaker 1] (3:36:48 - 3:37:18)
Now we're, bottom page 26, document number 20096T1, 48th Ward, ordinance referred on July 24th of 19, common address 5356 North Sheridan Road, change request B33 community shopping district to a B23 neighborhood mixed use development. All right. Nick, you're our final of the morning session.

[Speaker 5] (3:37:19 - 3:38:19)
Thank you, sir. Again, for the record, Nick Fitikas from the Law Offices of Sam Banks. I'm here on behalf of the applicant and property owner regarding 5356 North Sheridan Road.

We are seeking a zoning change to establish a B2-3 type one transit oriented development zoning district. The proposed four-story building will have 50 residential units. On-site parking for 21 cars will be provided.

We are within 1,320 linear feet, as I mentioned, so this does qualify as a transit oriented development. I'd also point out for the record that the five required affordable units will be provided on-site within the proposed building. We've worked very closely with the Alderman's office.

We've also hosted a handful of neighborhood meetings with the Association of Sheridan Road Condo Association owners and a handful of individual condominium associations, and we believe we have support, although I would, of course, defer to the Alderman who's here with us. Great.

[Speaker 1] (3:38:20 - 3:38:30)
Questions for the applicant before we hear from Alderman Osterman? Just a quick question, maybe the Alderman will find. Is this where, was there a restaurant on this site?

[Speaker 5] (3:38:30 - 3:38:34)
It's the Wing Ho Chinese restaurant, yes.

[Speaker 1] (3:38:34 - 3:38:37)
Okay, I know the site. Alderman Osterman.

[Speaker 41] (3:38:38 - 3:39:07)
We refer to it as the iconic Wing Ho building, but luckily for us, Wing Ho is relocating to Broadway, so the Egg Rolls will still be there, but this is a solid housing development within our community. It'll have 10% affordable units on-site on Sheridan Road in a lot that has been somewhat underdeveloped. We had meetings with the community, the community's in support of this, as am I, and I would appreciate the members of the committee supporting this change.

[Speaker 1] (3:39:07 - 3:39:50)
Questions for Alderman Osterman? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move do pass on the item? Alderman Wagesback moves do pass on the item.

Alderman Wagesback moves do pass. You'll get me back in finance, won't you? Okay.

All those in favor? Aye. Aye, any opposed?

Senior Chair, the ayes have it, and this item is passed. We will reconvene in a separate meeting. Adjourned, we're adjourning.

Motion to adjourn. Alderman Roboyas moves to adjourn. So we are adjourned on the 10 a.m. meeting, and we will start a new meeting at two o'clock. Thank you for your patience.

Before we start with the public comment period, we have a motion to defer Mayoral Amendment 1918, the Amendment of the Municipal Code 1719-0118D regarding location or placement of freestanding facilities in Parks and Open Space POS District. So that item will be deferred. So, we're going to start the meeting with the public comment period.

I know we have a number of people signed up, but I do want to welcome State Senator Toy Hutchinson. She will lead off the public comment period. Welcome, Senator.

Sit right over here. Knock out my staff. Hello.

[Speaker 19] (4:30:27 - 4:34:27)
Thank you, members of the City Council. I see a lot of friends and wonderful people in here, and I know you're grappling with a lot of very serious issues. I'm really only here to say we're anxiously watching what it is you guys decide to do as you move forward in the zoning process for the cannabis legalization.

As many of you know, at the beginning of November, I will take over my new position as what they say in the press as cannabis czar. It's really Cannabis Oversight Regulatory Control Officer. That's not as cool.

It's not as cool. But I just wanted to give a little bit of an overview about what the goals are for me in particular, and that is to ensure that the two things that we took most seriously in this are at the forefront of it the entire time. When the governor asked me to take on this role, he said, point blank, if we don't get the criminal justice reform right, and if we don't get the social equity reform right, we will have failed, and I don't want to fail.

And it was something that was part of the biggest reason I was convinced to leave my current office to come do this, not only because I'm a chief drafter and a chief co-sponsor and, you know, colloquially called a marijuana mom, because I did this about public safety, and I did it for kids, and I did it for the fact that we don't have enough information to really help our communities deal with what is being normalized and legalized across this country. So we watched the other ten states, and we watched all the things that they didn't do, and the first and foremost thing that they didn't do is they didn't make any provisions whatsoever for people who were most impacted by the war on drugs to participate in this industry, that you cannot normalize and legalize this billion-dollar industry without making space for people who paid the biggest price for what prohibition was.

And we all know that prohibition doesn't work. It does not work. You can see that anywhere and anytime we use those things, it does not work.

So any criminal justice concern you have, any public health concern you have, any public safety concern you have tells me that's why the government needs to be in the middle of this. Right now, there's no such thing as a drug dealer that asks any of your children for ID. It doesn't happen.

And you would never, ever go to a friend's house and take their bathtub gin and put it in jars and sell it to everybody else, because we have liquor stores now. But those issues that individual municipalities will have to grapple with, and I know you will hear, because Kankakee doesn't look like Chicago. Chicago doesn't necessarily look like East St. Louis. East St. Louis doesn't necessarily look like Rockford. So we wanted to build into this the ability for you at your local level to decide what this looks like within your jurisdictions. And I stand ready to work with anybody to help you understand what's in the statute right now, but know that every single part of that 610-page bill was done with an eye towards equity at every single layer.

There were very big issues, very thorny issues we needed to deal with, but we studied court cases, we studied the Constitution, we studied the actual state-federal conflict. There was so much work and so much effort that went into this over the span of about three years before we got to this point that almost any of us are happy to share whatever we can with you as you go through your own deliberations. So I really just came to say that this is going to be legal on January 1, and we're going to be open and ready to operate in multiple places across the state.

And what we hope happens is that all of the things that we layered into the bill to get at those that were disproportionately impacted in the first place the entire time there was a prohibition are seen and heard and participatory as this is being normalized and legalized across this country. That is the goal. That is what we stand ready to do.

It is my principal mission for taking this job, and I just look forward to seeing how you get through the deliberatory process that you need to go through. And thank you so much for allowing me to address you today. It's my first time doing anything like this, even though I'm looking at people that I love.

So thank you all.

[Speaker 1] (4:34:28 - 4:36:07)
Thank you, Senator. And just for the record, though, she has been invited by our committee to be a special speaker. We will thank you for doing that, and good luck on your new job and protecting our citizens and our community.

So thank you. And with that being said, now we will open it up. No, no.

This is public comment period. We don't do that. You want to ask her?

You can go over and ask her on the side. All right? Because the public comment period, we don't ask questions.

They deliver, and they speak their mind. So I don't want to do it differently. All right.

So where is my script? Okay. So as we said earlier in this morning's meeting, each speaker will be limited to three minutes to address all items on the agenda.

You'll be the only opportunity to address the items on the agenda, and the committee will not conduct separate public comment before each item agenda. We haven't... All right.

Okay. So we... Okay.

So we have a number of people here on the cannabis ordinance, but the first item is on the appointment of Maurice Cox. So if... Is it Andre?

Brimfeld? Could you come to the mic, please?

[Speaker 54] (4:36:14 - 4:36:14)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (4:36:23 - 4:36:23)
Good afternoon.

[Speaker 70] (4:36:24 - 4:37:50)
Good afternoon. My name is Andre Brumfield. I'm principal in charge of planning and urban design for Gensler Architects.

I would like to speak on behalf of Maurice Cox. I've had the pleasure of working with Maurice and his team in Detroit on three neighborhood master plans, two that are focused on the corridors, another one focused on a distressed neighborhood. One thing that Maurice made very clear was not only his commitment to having a high-quality product that needed to be developed to create the master plan, but also how do we actually find ways to actually create strategies toward implementation.

I am thrilled that Maurice is here in Chicago. I think it's just short of a master stroke by the mayor that we were able to get him here to Chicago. He's someone who's not only committed to the neighborhoods, but he's also committed to the people.

And I think that he will be a very good advocate for the communities and for the residents that actually reside in those communities to bring about positive change. I look forward to seeing what Maurice can do in partnership, if you will, not only with the design community, with the development community, but more importantly with the community itself and how he is going to find ways to bring the department to the community as opposed to the other way around. So that said, I'm thankful that Maurice is here.

I hope that he will have success working with us as a community as a whole and look forward to working with him and also the administration. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (4:37:50 - 4:38:47)
Thank you very much. All right. Moving on.

The next series of witnesses are all on cannabis legislation. And we will start. We have many, many in support.

We have a handful or so in objection. So I will start the first three or four that are in favor. And we'll start with Kimberly.

Kimberly Bears, followed by Jameen Patel, David Collada, and Edmund Hamilton. So with the extent that we've got lots of support, obviously let's not duplicate and try to keep our testimony below the three minutes because we want to get home in a reasonable hour or two. Thanks.

Kimberly.

[Speaker 72] (4:38:47 - 4:40:09)
Thank you, Alderman Tunney. And good afternoon, Alderman Tunney and members of city council. My name is Kimberly Bears.

I'm the president and CEO of the Magnificent Mile Association. And I want to thank you for the opportunity to speak today about the issue of cannabis sales and where dispensaries can open on and after January 1, 2020. As we know, cannabis is an emerging industry and our understanding of its economic, social, and health impacts will continue to evolve over the next several years.

In the meantime, we at the association appreciate the mayor's commitment to social equity and ensuring that those most affected by the criminalization of marijuana benefit from its legalization. A cannabis dispensary in the Magnificent Mile District, which includes North Michigan Avenue, could be a tourist destination and significant source of tax revenue. We appreciate the mayor's willingness to dialogue with our organization, formed of 700 businesses across industries, and amend the boundaries of the exclusionary zone to allow a dispensary near North Michigan Avenue.

We hope that in the future, we can revisit the current zone as we work closely with the mayor, our alderman, and city council to ensure that our city remains a shining example of Midwestern hospitality and an exemplary place to visit, live, and work. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (4:40:11 - 4:40:37)
All right. Kimberly, thank you for adhering to the two minutes. So let's try to keep it to that level because, again, we've got scores of testimony here.

Can we ask that we reset the clock to two and we'll see how much... We'll get... George, we'll...

[Speaker 77] (4:40:37 - 4:40:38)
Yes, sir.

[Speaker 1] (4:40:38 - 4:40:50)
Okay, we'll get... Mr. Blakemore, I know you're on our witness slip, so we'll be happy to hear from you in a very short period of time. Next.

Okay, all right.

[Speaker 78] (4:40:51 - 4:41:48)
Hi, I'm Jamin Patel. I'm the chief investment officer of Progressive Treatment Solutions. We're an Illinois licensee.

We've been in the program since the beginning. We have a grow-down state as well as two locations, including one in the city of Chicago, and we'd like to have an adult-use location slightly inside the exclusion zone. So we'd ask that council consider modifying that location, and I think the city's missing an opportunity to increase economic activity in the program and generate significant sales tax revenue.

It could be to the tunes of hundreds of millions of dollars, depending on the number of dispensaries that are allowed in the state, or in the exclusion zone, and given the fact that tourists are mainly in the area of that shopping area that's part of the exclusion zone, I think they're missing an opportunity, again, for significant revenue. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (4:41:49 - 4:42:17)
Thank you, sir. I misspoke earlier, but David Collada is here. Where is David?

Why don't you come in? Because you're the only speaker on the EV ordinance. Come on down.

Because we've got a lot of... Oh, well, we don't have sheets from them. Let's see.

All right. Why don't we hold EV until it's grouped? So I'm going to put you a little...

Okay. So, Mr. Edmund Hamilton.

[Speaker 45] (4:42:22 - 4:44:24)
Hi, I'm Dante Hamilton. I'm the founder and lead organizer of Cannabis Equity Meetup Group, which has about 170 members, and I produce a cannabis equity conference and expo. So I have two comments here that I want to make.

They're related specifically to the lottery process and also opening up the exclusion zone. First, there's a significant amount of confusion about the process as it relates to social equity and community plans. Most of...all of the attendees at my recent event were not even aware that there was a lottery process or that there was a cannabis zoning community information session being held all last week. So fortunately, I had the documents, I printed them out, and I emailed them to the committee. I mean, to the members at that event. As a result, I proposed to the group that we create a way to recognize and honor the social equity applicants seeking a dispensary license who have the best community plans, thereby creating something like a gold standard of a group of applicants in the event that none of these gold standard applicants win in the lottery process.

I feel that there should be a second-chance drawing. Second-chance drawings are available in 43 of 44 states that hold lotteries. Rules vary by state, but the general concept is if you buy the lotteries, your non-winning tickets can win you a prize.

The last thing I want to say is that with respect to opening up the River North exclusionary zone, this is an idea that I got from someone that's in this room. I recommend that there be a cannabis business development fund with a minimum of at least a million dollars or more available to social equity applicants who are not able to get a dispensary in the downtown area, but who also may want to develop another type of dispensary or a cannabis business enterprise. And a portion of that money should be available for independent, unaffiliated, as-yet-unnamed incubator in the River North area in the Brendan Riley Ward.

[Speaker 1] (4:44:28 - 4:44:57)
All right. Toriano Sansoni. Where are we going?

And followed by Gabrielle Mendoza and Amy Nathan. If your name is called, please form the line and let's go. Thanks.

[Speaker 74] (4:44:59 - 4:46:15)
Toriano? Thank you, city council and attendees. I just wanted to say I think it's fabulous that this is coming to Chicago.

I live in Amsterdam, so I know the possibilities that can happen. I think that a lot should be modeled off of Amsterdam and the Netherlands because they've been doing this for a thousand years, much longer than we have. And then being from North Lawndale, there's so many opportunities, in particular with the land.

You know, there's... I just think about Roosevelt and Costa, that piece of land, 23 acres, that's been there for... Since I'm 45, it's been open for so many years.

But it's just a great opportunity for... When we talk about social equity, you know, you're going to hear that word a lot, social equity, and what does that mean of how people of color can be incorporated into all the different facets, whether it's manufacturing, distribution, retail, sales, security. But I think that there has to be a lot of people digging deeper into people that have done this.

Just a quick show of hands, who's been to the Netherlands before? I mean, that's a big deal. I mean, they've done what we've done before, so I think that needs to be really incorporated into the fabric so we can really get the most, you know, out of this experience.

Thank you.

[Speaker 47] (4:46:15 - 4:46:26)
Thank you, sir. Thank you, committee members. I'm here on behalf of Chicago Normal, and I'm...

[Speaker 1] (4:46:26 - 4:46:27)
Your name again?

[Speaker 47] (4:46:27 - 4:48:28)
Gabriel Mendoza. We're here in support. I'm a founding board member of Chicago Normal, so I'd like to thank you guys for this opportunity.

Chicago Normal is a local chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. We have worked for the past two and a half years helping to create equitable legislation for medical marijuana patients, adult recreational consumers, and owners of both plant-touching and non-plant-touching businesses. One of our current efforts is promoting plant education to our constituents in the area of plant science, history of the plant, and cannabis business economics.

During our regular meetings and classes, we meet and hear from dozens of individuals and groups who are preparing themselves to apply for cannabis licensure as social equity applicants in the city of Chicago and surrounding suburbs. For the past several months, we have collaborated with the Mayor Lightfoot's office and other cannabis equity advocacy groups to conceptualize how the city would create and implement zoning regulations to be ready for the next wave of cannabis businesses. We've worked diligently and expeditiously, keeping in mind both that the timing for new applicants is very short, and our topic was limited to land use only.

Given the fact that in the previous rounds of medical licenses, there were practically no cannabis businesses located in communities of color, we support the creation of the seven zones to promote a more fair and uniform distribution of cannabis businesses throughout the city. While we recognize that the process is not perfect, we will not let the idea of perfect be the enemy of good progress. We are confident that the concerns of our constituents are being heard, understood, and taken into consideration.

We look forward to working with the Mayor's office as we continue to develop mechanisms and opportunities for new crops of cannabis businesses and revenue-underserved areas.

[Speaker 1] (4:48:30 - 4:48:31)
Thank you, sir.

[Speaker 57] (4:48:40 - 4:48:40)
Hello.

[Speaker 54] (4:48:41 - 4:48:41)
Hello.

[Speaker 57] (4:48:42 - 4:50:28)
Hi. Thank you for the opportunity. My name is Amy Nathan.

I represent Growmentum Lab. Growmentum Lab is a business accelerator in the cannabis space. To help launch social equity businesses quickly so that social equity applicants can reap the greatest rewards as quickly as possible.

We are also, as Gabriel mentioned, we are also helping consult people pro bono for applications, and that will be for dispensaries and future applications as well. One of the things that we really wanted to make sure that everybody thought about a little bit and potentially that there was some movement on regarding the social equity space was that in the statute there is an opportunity for businesses to obtain social equity points, if you will, in application for demonstrating that they have 51% hiring in the DIAs, the disproportionately impacted areas. I wanted to point out that this was in fact not social equity, but perhaps social justice at best, which is great.

However, also to put on the backs of the people you're hiring that they have to prove that they are from where they say they are, rather than actually giving them equity, ownership stake in the businesses that hire them, to me is a little bit of dissonance, and to the people that we work with a little bit of dissonance. So we'd like to see the city of Chicago enforce an additional opportunity to ask those businesses if that is the reason that they are claiming social equity to have employee ownership stake as well.

[Speaker 1] (4:50:29 - 4:50:57)
Thank you. All right. Now I'm going to ask Peter Cantos to come up.

He is opposed. Kyra Woods in favor, and Rhonda Thompson who did not indicate in favor. Okay.

So for those three, please.

[Speaker 29] (4:51:11 - 4:53:14)
Hello everybody. Do I get two minutes or three minutes for this? Two minutes.

Three. Let's start. All right.

Thank you very much for having me today. My name is Peter Cantos. I'm with the Cannabis Equity Coalition.

We've been organizing since April this year to ensure social equity and social justice is included in the state bill, and now we're focusing on the local level. We are encouraged by this piece of legislation in that it creates cannabis consumption cafes, but we cannot support this amendment until we are requiring every business that wants to do business in the city of Chicago in the recreational cannabis space agree to a community benefits agreement. It's absolutely imperative that these companies are both signing on to diversity training plans as well as committing to putting money into a community fund similar to the R3 program that was created at the state level for a citywide fund to both reduce violence and promote economic opportunity.

We have a model from the city of Los Angeles that shows that we have the tactics to reduce violence and promote economic opportunity. We just need to fund it. This can be that vehicle for funding, and we would like to see that included in the amendment.

We encourage the city council to come to one of our meetings. We meet every single Tuesday night down at the Port Ministries on the south side and back of the yards. We want to make this as collaborative a space as possible because we know that this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for us to right the wrongs of the war on drugs and to make sure it's the people who benefit from the cannabis plant, not the corporations.

We've seen 10 other states do this, and every single state has had white male-dominated cannabis industries. We cannot let that happen in Illinois, and we cannot allow that to happen in the city of Chicago. And with that, we are demanding that the city council postpone the vote on this ordinance until we are able to insert legislation regarding community-based agreements so we can ensure equity in the long term.

Thank you. Thank you.

[Speaker 68] (4:53:25 - 4:54:20)
Rhonda? Rhonda, are you... Hi, my name is Rhonda Thompson.

I am a business owner, a property owner. I have commercial property also in Chicago for the last 35 years. I employ, work with, and I'm a part of my community.

I am for marijuana, cannabis, dispensary. I'd like to be one of the first to own it in my community. I also have a limousine company.

I have three different companies that I have, and one is a limousine company. And I travel people here all the time from different states. I talk to people from California and different places where marijuana is legal, and the one thing he left me with food for thought was, we have plenty of liquor stores and taverns in our neighborhood.

This young man said to me, he said, people that drink run red lights. People that smoke stop at green lights. Food for thought.

[Speaker 1] (4:54:22 - 4:54:49)
Thank you, thank you. Well put. All right.

Next we're going to have Kevin Slaughter, who is opposed, followed by Willie Fleming in favor, Patty Gallagher in favor, and Susan Fox, I don't know. So let's get the following people in order.

[Speaker 62] (4:54:50 - 4:56:22)
Hi, my name is Kevin Slaughter. I'm a local attorney. I represent Viola Brands, which is the largest African-American owned operator in the space in the country.

And I also represent some smaller groups here in Chicago that are interested in applying. Everyone has talked about social equity, and the state, when they adopted this act, one of the goals was to lower the barriers of entry to individuals who had been mostly impacted by the war on drugs and entering the cannabis business. I'd like to bring the committee's attention to the third criteria that one of the women just spoke about, what I call the employee criteria, which requires that an applicant that has 10 or more employees, 51% of those employees either live in a DIA or are affected by the war on drugs.

That is not actually, that actually does not eliminate barriers for social equity applicants. That's a benefit to current providers, because current providers are the likely applicants that are going to have 10 full-time employees right now. And merely having your employees reside in that area, as opposed to the ownership test, which requires that you live in a DIA for five of the last 10 years, does not level the playing field.

All it does is allow every current operator to qualify as a social equity applicant. So what I'm asking this committee to do is to give the applicants that meet the criteria of ownership, that either 51% of their owners live in a DIA for the last five or 10 years or have been impacted by the war on drugs, they should get two balls in the lottery. And that will help reduce the barriers and actually give a benefit to the people that were intended to get the benefit.

[Speaker 1] (4:56:22 - 4:56:23)
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

[Speaker 33] (4:56:31 - 4:58:45)
Good afternoon. And thank you, city council. My name is Willie J.

R. Fleming. I'm an organizer, activist, and a social equity applicant.

On behalf of the Chicago Anti-Eviction Campaign, Hood for Humanity, and Hemp for Hood, we would like to thank the city council and the Cannabis Task Force for all of your genuine concern about equity. Having an opportunity to participate on this task where we were able to witness the commitment to equity by community leaders, advocates, and the mayor's policy team, we support the zoning you have before you today, knowing that it is one in many steps to achieve equity. A lot of the issues and concerns being raised both by the audience, elected officials, is an issue for the state.

We stand before you today to say that we're willing to go with you to the state during a veto session to get more equity in this bill. But today, if you delay this process, there are members of this audience who have invested time, money, and resources to qualifying as a social equity applicant. You'll be putting them at a great disservice.

There are a lot of things in the bill that folks wanted but didn't get. Like many of the folks out here today, we can't Johnny come late in the game. Our organization didn't form until April of this year when we saw that there needed to be some equity in this bill, and we needed to support this.

Any bill that would discuss equity for the African-American and Latino communities, we wanted to see it happen. More than anything, we wanted to see an opportunity for 770,000 people impacted by marijuana charges be removed from their records. There has never been an opportunity Thank you, sir.

[Speaker 1] (4:58:48 - 4:59:02)
Thank you. Next, I think Miss Patty Gallagher, Alderman Burnett. Hold on one second.

[Speaker 10] (4:59:05 - 4:59:30)
Just point of information, Mr. Chairman, and I know you don't want me to ask the audience questions, but I need to know if they were given anything to come and say these things. Because what they're saying out there is that some of these guys are paying folks to be part of their social equity thing, then they kick them out. And those are things that we're very concerned about.

[Speaker 1] (4:59:30 - 4:59:31)
Yep.

[Speaker 10] (4:59:33 - 4:59:34)
Motives are interesting.

[Speaker 1] (4:59:36 - 4:59:38)
Patty, Patty Gallagher.

[Speaker 50] (4:59:40 - 4:59:58)
Good afternoon, Chairman Tunney and members of the Zoning Committee. I am actually, I'm Patty Gallagher, and I'm signed up actually to support the nomination of Maurice Cox for Commissioner of Planning and Development. So if the council would permit, I could defer that testimony.

[Speaker 1] (4:59:58 - 5:00:01)
No, we've already heard one person testimony, so carry on.

[Speaker 50] (5:00:01 - 5:01:47)
Okay. I am an independent planning consultant and a resident of the Portage Park neighborhood, ward number 36, and here to offer my support for Maurice Cox as Commissioner of Planning and Development. Planning and Development has a very special place in my heart.

I started there as a junior planner, did two tours, worked under three mayors and five planning commissioners before leaving and going to Washington, D.C. to pursue my career there. But I met Maurice in 2005 through the Harvard Design School, the Loeb Fellowship, of which I am a member of the Loeb Fellowship. And since completing that fellowship, I have watched Maurice's career expand from mayor of Charlotte to the design director for the Endowment of the Arts, working under two U.S. presidents, and then as planning director for the city of Detroit. Maurice brings this valuable experience, along with stellar academic credentials, to the significant development challenges facing the city of Chicago, and I thank Mayor Lightfoot for her wisdom in selecting Maurice for this job. I had the privilege of working for the Department of Planning and Development during the years of incredible economic prosperity and physical growth, where downtown and the surrounding neighborhoods were virtually transformed. When I returned to Chicago, I was struck by the growing disparity between those places of prosperity and the economic and social conditions of the neighborhood.

This is wrong.

[Speaker 77] (5:01:48 - 5:01:49)
This is wrong.

[Speaker 1] (5:01:49 - 5:02:02)
I get it. Thank you, Patty. Susan?

Susan Fox.

[Speaker 76] (5:02:04 - 5:03:13)
Okay, my name is Susan Fox. I am a private resident. I don't represent anyone other than myself.

I'm a voter in the city of Chicago. This is the first time I've ever come to one of these meetings, and I feel very strongly in support of the exclusion zone, although the reason I didn't check the box was because I wasn't exactly sure what the exclusion zone is at this point. I did read the article in Cranes that there's some changes being made.

I currently live at the corner of Jackson and South Michigan Avenue, so I am within the exclusion zone. I'm at ground zero of all the major events that happen in the city, including the recent marathon, and I'm very happy, and I support the mayor's decision to try and reduce congestion and other traffic problems in that part of the city by including our building within the exclusion zone. Great.

[Speaker 1] (5:03:13 - 5:03:40)
Thank you, Susan. Okay. Now, the next set of speakers will have George Blakemore, who's opposed.

Mr. George Blakemore, I'm sorry, is opposed, and Caitlin Johnson is in favor and also is Bruce Montgomery, who is in favor. Mr. Blakemore.

[Speaker 20] (5:03:41 - 5:05:46)
Thank you. A new phrase, social equity. Institutional racism.

It's been a while since we got here off the boat enslaving people in America. Racism! These whites got all these medical ones, and then they're coming in and going, keep the one they got, and then they're going to get an additional one.

And then you go around here and say, it's the state where something's wrong with the black representative down at the state to allow this venusia to go on. These black folks was aware of this. They've been going along with it with mannequins and colletans.

They tell these black people what to do. Some of them are there prostitutes. You heard that.

That's what they are. Social equity. Institutional racism.

These white folks are getting this money, been getting this money, and going to continue to get this money as long as we have our little black donkeys folks not representing us. Not representing us! And you keep putting them back.

Economic, in the black community. In power. I don't see it.

But you got black venusia up. You got black on this board and that board and they up here. You're not doing social equity.

And you're going to come up and say three minutes. Then you're going to come up and change and say two minutes. Who do you think you are?

And then you're going to call me George after I told you no. You still going to say, George, then Mr. Blakemore. Who do y'all white folks think you are?

Or who do you think we are? Who do you think we are? We're still on your planet.

[Speaker 1] (5:05:53 - 5:06:10)
I think Kaitlin Johnson did and Bruce Montgomery Hi, thank you.

[Speaker 19] (5:06:11 - 5:06:56)
My name is Kaitlin Johnson. I'm here with the People United for Racial Equity. We're here because we really want to make sure that the centerpiece of equity is continued in all processes of zoning and kind of recognizing that delaying any process could without a solution to address the equity could actually put a lot of people out of the opportunity to being able to apply for these licenses.

We've worked with a lot of groups who have been working to build their applications together and a lot of effort has been put forth to be able to create those packages. So there's a lot of folks here from People for Racial Equity today and we just want to make sure that any decision that gets made continues to center equity and continues to center the folks who have been most impacted by the war on drugs.

[Speaker 1] (5:06:56 - 5:07:24)
Thank you very much. Bruce Montgomery Bruce, Going once? Going once?

Vice will hold that. So those are the speakers to the best of my knowledge on the cannabis. We have a group of individuals would like to speak on the electric vehicle ordinance of Alderman Riley.

[Speaker 3] (5:07:27 - 5:07:28)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (5:07:28 - 5:08:00)
Alrighty. So for the record, we have Paul Rosenfeld not wanting to speak but in support. Now we'll bring up Kyra Woods.

Yes. From Sierra Club. David Collada.

My mistake again. Thanks for your patience. So it's Kyra, David and Milena Hessel, I believe.

And they are all in favor.

[Speaker 46] (5:08:02 - 5:10:04)
Good afternoon. My name is Kyra Woods and I'm here today representing Sierra Club. Thank you for spending time with us today.

I wanted to speak in favor. Yes, of this particular ordinance, but also call the fact that it could stand to be a bit stronger nationally over the last 52 months consecutively, we've seen national increase in the sales of electric vehicles. And for the first nine months in 2018, we saw 70% increase of sales of those types of vehicles.

So as a young Chicagoan who has elected some of you, not all of you clearly, to be forward thinking and progressive in the policies and strategies that we put forth for Chicago, I ask that we carry those same values for this type of development as well. So in this particular ordinance, we have only a requirement that two parking spaces be ready for EV charging. And that's just honestly not progressive enough.

We are building new buildings and homes and commercial real estate for the future. And the parking spaces should be a part of that as well. We seek integrated solutions that are going to last.

And so we would really like to see that maybe there be a percentage of the parking spaces based on the size of the parking space as well as the building be proportionally mandated to be for electric charging vehicles. And then we also would like to see that the minimum size be lowered so that other neighborhoods and individuals could truly participate in this emerging economy. So as we talk all today about social equity, we want to see that clean technologies, green technologies, not just be for the chosen few in this community and across the city, but something that is accessible to communities across the city in different wards and from different economic standings.

So we would like to see a stronger ordinance. This is a great start, but if we are really going to achieve our values and our milestones of 100% clean energy for the city, we need to step up our game and we're looking to you to do so.

[Speaker 53] (5:10:04 - 5:11:59)
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My name is David Collada and I'm the Executive Director of the Citizens Utility Board and I rise in support of the EB ordinance before you today.

Transportation electrification has great potential benefits for the city. It's good for consumers, good for the environment, and good for public health as long as we have the right policies in place. But we have to make sure that we get ahead of it and that's what this ordinance does.

I want to illustrate the importance of it by talking about a building that we've worked with in the South Loop. There were many people in there who had electric vehicles. They wanted to invest in a level 2 charger, which is at 240 volts like you would have for a washing machine or an oven.

They were going to do it. They went to their condo board. They were told that that work would have cost one million dollars to do that.

The reason why? They would have had to cut through concrete and rewire the whole building. What this ordinance is about is making sure from the planning process from the get-go with new construction that that's taken care of.

The costs associated with it are virtually nil and it really is essential that the city pass these types of policies to get ahead of it so that consumer choice is expanded and so that costs are reduced going forward. I want to thank Alderman Riley for his leadership on this issue. I will say that we're a little bit perplexed in that the ordinance I think you're voting on today is a substitute ordinance that does go a little bit backwards from where we were at the end of the last administration.

I know Alderman Riley worked hard on that. Because of that, we may find a need to come back here in a few months to strengthen it. This is a start but certainly we do have questions about why we're voting on the weaker one.

It's an extraordinarily important issue and at CUB we take it very seriously and we thank you for supporting it. Appreciate it. Thank you David.

[Speaker 56] (5:12:04 - 5:13:58)
Hello and thank you. My name is Malena Hessel and I'm a Senior Policy Advocate with the Environmental Law and Policy Center. ELPC is a Midwestern public interest environmental advocacy group headquartered here in Chicago.

We've spent 25 years finding common sense solutions that work for the environment and work for the economy. This ordinance, making sure that new construction has the infrastructure to be ready for electric vehicles is an example of such a common sense solution. EV ready buildings are important not just because transportation in Illinois is our largest contributor of greenhouse gas emissions but also because vehicles are a source of ground level air pollution contributing to asthma and other respiratory problems.

The ordinance that was introduced originally last year requiring two EV ready spaces and larger new construction projects would be a step toward making Chicago's building stock EV ready. The ordinance Alderman Riley introduced this year, this September, is still an attainable step but it would be more meaningful. It involves requiring EV ready parking spaces for 20% of the parking spaces in more buildings.

ELPC supports both ordinances but is confused why Chicago wouldn't want the most meaningful reasonable step on the table, the language introduced this September. It's relatively easy and inexpensive to wire new construction but it's important to think down the road and wire buildings in a way that meets future projected needs. So Chicago doesn't need to retrace steps when it is more expensive to do additional work down the line to retrofit our building stock.

[Speaker 1] (5:13:59 - 5:14:31)
Thank you very much. I'll call the next I believe the final four speakers on the EV ordinance and they are Christy Hicks. That's going to be a...

Brian Rubenski Sorry. Mark Nabone and Colleen Smith and they are all in favor.

[Speaker 59] (5:14:35 - 5:16:17)
Thank you. Good afternoon. My name is Christy Hicks.

I am a senior attorney for Environmental Defense Fund. We have tens of thousands of members and activists across the state and in office here in Chicago and I want to thank you for the opportunity to speak here today about the EV ordinance. I'm here today because electric vehicle readiness and adoption are particularly pressing issues here in Illinois where the transportation sector is the largest emitter of greenhouse gas emissions in the state.

EDF particularly supports the September 18, 2019 proposal from Alderman Riley which requires that new 5 plus residential dwellings and new construction with 30 or more parking spaces must have infrastructure to support electric vehicle charging for at least 20 percent of the parking spaces. This ordinance offers tremendous opportunity for the city of Chicago to be viewed as a leader in the technology of the future, clean energy and to prepare for the coming influx of electric vehicles. Next generation electric vehicle models are expected to enter the market at lower prices and higher volume.

Sales of plug-in EVs were up 12 percent in the first half of 2019 as compared to the first half of 2018. And Bloomberg New Energy Finance has estimated that globally more than half of new cars sold by 2040 will be electric vehicles. It is important that we have infrastructure to support and enable this eventuality.

It is good for the economy and for the environment of the city. So EDF encourages the city to adopt an ordinance which supports robust, equitable electric vehicle adoption. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (5:16:17 - 5:16:21)
Thank you. Brian.

[Speaker 52] (5:16:22 - 5:18:29)
My name is Brian Herbichewski. I'm the director of Environmental Health Programs for Respiratory Health Association. We're a lung health charity founded on the west side in 1906 working to reduce lung disease and promote clean air.

I'm also in favor of the ordinance. What I'd like to say is that Chicago really needs to address global warming and reduce greenhouse gases now. As Christy said, vehicles are now the number one cause of climate change here.

Climate change causes a lot of things, but it's a health problem in our view. We're going to get more and hotter heat waves that will cause more people to get sick and die. We're going to see more flooding and damage and disease.

We're going to see more smoke from wildfires. And this is at a time when Chicago also had 20 days last year where the air exceeded federal health standards. There's areas of Chicago, especially the west and the south sides, where the asthma rate for children exceeds 20%.

And these are the people that are breathing air pollution and feeling the effects of automobile emissions. We've missed federal deadlines to reduce smog twice already since 2012 and we're still out of compliance and we might miss the next deadline as well. The city of Vancouver passed an ordinance 10 years ago to do what Chicago is considering today.

They required 20% of parking spaces and multi-unit residential buildings to be EV ready. Atlanta and New York City have also done this. They also required at least one space in every single family home to be EV ready.

This was 10 years ago. As of 2018, they increased that to 100% of all residential units. Back then, there weren't a lot of electric cars.

Right now, there are 38 models people can buy that will plug in and run on electricity. And people want these vehicles. A study just published this month by the Union of Concerned Scientists and Consumers Union found that 6 in 10 prospective car buyers in Illinois have some interest in purchasing an electric vehicle, including 33% who say they would at least consider buying one within the next two years.

I urge you to support this ordinance, to clean our air and to address climate change before it's too late. Thank you.

[Speaker 49] (5:18:29 - 5:20:36)
Thank you, Brian. Hello. Thank you for having me.

My name is Mark Nabong which is appropriate for the day in which the cannabis legislation is being debated. I'm here from the Natural Resources Defense Council. We are in favor of this bill and for those listening who are not sure why folks like us are in favor of this bill is when it comes to building space, infrastructure for clean vehicles, you know that your grandkids are going to be riding clean buses.

You know that your great-grandkids are going to be driving clean vehicles. Now is the time for Chicago to take leadership there and make that available so that Chicago can continue to be a leadership in transportation and infrastructure in the future. What the bills do and we prefer much like our colleagues the stronger bill that requires 20% of all spaces to be dedicated to this.

What the bills do is they make new construction depending on the size of the building but they make new construction require a certain number of spaces available because it's way cheaper to do it earlier on than later. That's what we want. We want to save consumers money.

We want to save the lungs of kids who have to breathe this stuff in and we want to make it easier for all residents of Chicago not just people that own $92,000 Teslas we want folks that buy a used $10,000 LEAF to have access to these charging stations as well. Here's why it's important. If you put this infrastructure in early, it's cheap.

If you put it in later, it's really expensive and really messy. Has anyone here ever made chocolate chip cookies? I know you have.

Have you ever not put in the chocolate chips first and then gone back and tried to add them after they were baked? It doesn't work as well. That's why we want to see one of these bills probably the stronger version out there so that everyone not just rich folks, not just people who live in Highland Park but everybody who wants clean air and wants their kids to be able to go to school and not cough up black like I used to because my dad drove an 81 Cutlass Supreme.

We want all those people to have access to charging stations.

[Speaker 1] (5:20:37 - 5:20:37)
Thank you.

[Speaker 49] (5:20:38 - 5:20:42)
Colleen Smith. Colleen?

[Speaker 1] (5:20:45 - 5:22:30)
No? Okay. Not here.

Okay. That concludes the public commentary portion of the meeting. I also, for the record, want to highlight that we did three community meetings around town last week, north, west, and south.

We had approximately a little over 100 individuals testify at each of these meetings. We have heard loud and clear about how we're progressing as a city with cannabis legislation, so thank you for that. First up on the agenda is the Mayoral Appointment 19-20 that being the appointment of Maurice Cox as Commissioner of the Department of Planning and Development.

We're going to ask the Acting Commissioner to come down here. Yes, sir. Great.

Good afternoon. Thank you for coming in front of us today. I know you were at the Economic Development Committee meeting of which I was there, so we'll start.

It's similar nature. Your testimony, it's all yours. I'll let you orchestrate it.

[Speaker 2] (5:22:31 - 5:26:47)
Thank you and good afternoon. Chairman Tunney, Vice-Chairman Ravoyos, the members of the Committee on Zoning Landmarks and Building Standards. I want to start firstly by thanking Mayor Lightfoot for appointing me as Acting Commissioner for the Department of Planning and Development for the City of Chicago.

I accepted the appointment because it's simply an opportunity of a lifetime, one that will enable me to apply my experience as an urban designer, an architect, an educator, an advocate for community engagement. And more importantly, it will afford me the opportunity to help resolve the fundamental equity issues that have impaired the country's most uniquely American city, Chicago, for far too long. As Commissioner, my primary goal will be to create genuine, community-based partnerships that foster positive changes in your wards, especially involving job creation, public amenities, economic opportunity, and the quality of life improvements that are so crucial to any city's future, including public safety and education.

I believe my professional history has prepared me well for this moment. It includes ten years as an architect in Florence, Italy, where I met my wife and we started our family, eight years as both a mayor and city councilman in Charlottesville, Virginia, where I learned firsthand the responsibilities and challenges of being a public official, and several years as design director for the National Endowment for the Arts in Washington, where I represented both the Bush and the Obama administrations on design issues related to the federal government. In this role, I also served as design liaison and confidant to more than 120 mayors across the country, where I learned that I'd much rather be an advisor to mayors and council members more than being an elected official myself. I should mention that I've also been a professor at several universities including the University of Virginia, Harvard, Graduate School of Design, and Tulane University, where I was also the associate dean for community engagement and director of the Tulane City Center, which helped spearhead post-Katrina recovery efforts in New Orleans.

It was this ground-up, community-driven process that led to my appointment as director of planning and development for Detroit, where we helped change the city's narrative, involving many of the difficult revitalization issues currently facing Chicago. My primary focus in Detroit was to create a new, resident-centered planning department that championed the equitable development of local neighborhoods. Our strategy layered all the amenities that make neighborhoods worth living in, where we shop, where your kids play, how you get around on public transportation, and where you work.

I believe it was this holistic, community-driven result that caught Mayor Lightfoot's attention and why she asked me to come to Chicago, and to create the partnerships, initiatives, and institutional improvements that will benefit all wards citywide. I'm confident we can make the improvements that our neighborhoods need the most. That's what I've done my entire career.

That's why I'm here. I'm seeking your approval to get this job going, and I'm happy to answer any questions that you may have. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (5:26:50 - 5:27:24)
Thank you, Acting Commissioner. We have a number of aldermen that would like to comment on this. Actually, before we get into aldermen commenting, we had lost an application in the public testimony.

There was one individual that wanted to talk about your appointment, and that is Mary Eisenbach, I believe. Mary, you have two minutes if you want to talk about our nominee.

[Speaker 58] (5:27:26 - 5:29:09)
Yes, thank you, committee members. I'm here to speak on behalf of Maurice Cox's appointment as the Commissioner of the Department of Planning and Development. I know Maurice because we were Loeb Fellows at Harvard University's Graduate School of Design.

I grew up in the Chicago area, and I purposely returned to Chicago after my fellowship because I love this city. For that reason, I am delighted and excited at the prospect of Maurice taking the helm of such an important research in this city. We were given an assignment on our first day of our fellowship, Change the World.

We all understood, as Maurice has proven in his work, that both the built environment and the processes used to create that environment are critical tools to create healthy, equitable communities. Maurice's work is inclusionary with an emphasis on creating trust between the residents and their city government. He understands that community engagement is not just a catchphrase, but a necessary ingredient in creating plans, designs, and policies that benefit the public, all the public.

In Detroit, his vision for the city's recovery has been both inspirational and pragmatic. His vision for the city's recovery has been both inspirational and pragmatic, and he is passionate about creating social and economic opportunities through good planning and aspirational urban design. Chicago would be hard-pressed to find a more thoughtful achiever with the breadth of experience necessary to give us the great neighborhoods that we deserve.

Like many in this room who have entered public service, Maurice's goal to change the world is now focused in Chicago and how fortunate this city will be for it. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (5:29:10 - 5:29:21)
Thank you, and my apologies for not recognizing you during the public comment period. Alright, now we're going to start with committee members. Alderman Beal.

[Speaker 16] (5:29:23 - 5:31:31)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon, Acting Commissioner. Good afternoon.

Acting Commissioner, I can honestly say that I have done some research on you and your performance, and I think you are uniquely qualified for this particular position and I think all of us are looking forward to working with you to try to bring some equity and parity throughout the entire city. We've had lengthy conversation as it relates to bringing that parity to the city and we look forward to working with you to obtain that. It's going to be difficult, but we are all up to the challenge to work with you on obtaining those goals and bringing jobs and opportunities to our community.

I like your vision as far as trying to bring strip malls into the community and try to revitalize business districts that have been suffering over the years. I think that's a key issue to bring those dollars back into the city. You provided us with some data that shows that a lot of well, let me say billions of dollars are leaving this city and particularly on the outskirts of the city where money is just bleeding over into the suburbs.

That's going to be a huge task for you to undertake, but as you move forward we just want to make sure that as you learn the city and I think it's really important that all of us work with you to learn the city and to learn each and one of our communities but that spillage is real. It's real and we need to stop it but when you have taxes low over in Indiana it's real easy for people to continue to cross the border being so close to the Indiana border like for us, like myself. We're really excited about the possibilities of you making that happen, but I do have one question for you that's really troubling to me and we talked about it.

How did you go about picking John Aria as one of your deputy commissioners?

[Speaker 2] (5:31:32 - 5:32:29)
Thank you, Alderman. As you know that appointment was well underway as I was onboarding so I looked at it from the lens of going from a city where I work with nine Alderman, city council members to 50 and it seemed very logical to me that any experience that I could gain on my team would be welcome so I didn't really even question it and so at this point I accept that I have 166 members on my team. Each of them I'm going through an evaluation to see where their talents lie and how I can make best use of them and Mr. Arena is no different.

[Speaker 16] (5:32:32 - 5:32:39)
So you're saying that was put in place before you arrived to the city of Chicago?

[Speaker 2] (5:32:39 - 5:33:09)
It was certainly in progress and so I had no sense of anything other than what I read from a resume that sounded perfectly acceptable to me and as I said, my job now is to make sure that he earns that place and earns my trust and that I put him to the use for the residents of Chicago.

[Speaker 16] (5:33:10 - 5:33:44)
Great. Well let me just say one of the things that's really disturbing to me is you stated early on that you're big on bringing in people of color into positions and right now I think you have two, well now you have three deputies and they're all non-people of color and to have an opening and then that's filled with somebody not of color that doesn't fit with your narrative about bringing diversity into your department. Can you speak on that?

[Speaker 2] (5:33:46 - 5:34:27)
Well I'm looking for diversity at every level of the organization. I certainly have positions at the senior level that are still open and I intend and I've already begun collecting names and interviewing people to fill those. I'm looking to diversify at the middle management level and I'm looking to diversify at the entry level and so I have a number of opportunities coming up if the budget that the mayor has put before you is accepted to further diversify my department.

I can assure you it's one of my top goals.

[Speaker 16] (5:34:27 - 5:35:25)
I just wanted to be clear that as you try to diversify your department that you had no input on that pick for non-diversity so to speak. One thing that another thing that kind of disturbs me is I received an email that goes back to July 18th where Mr. Arena was accepted in a position in DACP going back on July 18th he was slated to go to DCAP yeah, DACP back in July 18th July 23rd so I'm real curious to see how he was accepted in one department based on these emails that he was accepted but then he ended up in your department.

[Speaker 2] (5:35:27 - 5:35:36)
This happened before my arrival here in Chicago so I'm not aware of that that's all I have thank you Mr. Chairman

[Speaker 1] (5:35:37 - 5:35:39)
Alderman Austin

[Speaker 18] (5:35:42 - 5:36:16)
Thank you Mr. Chairman I know you have impeccable credentials but in your statement where you're going to create a residential department of planning in that how will that entity bring about new businesses because you're saying that my residents are the one that's going to be bringing in businesses so how will you achieve that

[Speaker 2] (5:36:21 - 5:38:04)
Madam Alderman I am committed to creating a resident centered department which allows residents when we work on plans for neighborhoods to be at the center of that conversation we listen very attentively what people who live in neighborhoods want from their neighborhoods and it is our job to try to match actionable implementable plans to their desires so if their desire is to shop more consistently local then it's our job to fill those storefronts with entrepreneurs and businesses that they want to patronize if they want a wider range of shopping options whether they be big boxes or shopping centers it's our job to attract and make opportunities for investment of that kind to happen so we listen very attentively to what residents need as amenities in their neighborhoods and then we attempt to bring that about to create the opportunity inevitably these are businesses that can employ local residents and so that's really the commitment I'm making to you to listen very attentively to what residents want in their neighborhoods and then our job is to marshal those public resources that allow the private sector to know this is where we need you to invest

[Speaker 18] (5:38:04 - 5:38:47)
I have an area at 115th and Halsted we've been marketing that particular site for the last 15 years my residents have asked for a Mariano a Whole Foods, a Kohl's, a Michaels or any of those entities now how if you have created a residential department of planning will any of those businesses come to that particular section you're going to be talking with them and the residents are going to tell you what they want and I just told you some of the things that they have been talking about for the last 15 years

[Speaker 2] (5:38:50 - 5:40:19)
if I may we have found at least in planning and development that the private sector looks for clear signals of where places are ready for investment. They look at where public dollars are being spent whether it's in the streetscapes whether it's to promote business development and then they are inclined to follow where that public investment directs them so I would have to look at what level of infrastructure was put in place that clearly signaled to the private sector to invest in the street you're talking about and in my experience in Detroit we have found that if you coordinate the small business development efforts in a targeted walkable geography if you use public investments to beautify the street make the public realm attractive then private investment will follow and I in my touring of many of the commercial corridors on the west and south side I have not found that level of coordination yet?

[Speaker 18] (5:40:20 - 5:41:57)
Well in my mind it is because all of the available dollars to invest public dollars into that particular area from 99th to 129th I have invested in it in streets, in lights, in improvements nothing has occurred at that particular location because we have not had the support of the department of planning but for you to say that you're going to continue to talk and make a residential department of planning my residents want to see what are you going to do but we will wait and see I know that you've done outstanding things in other cities and I'm sure that you will do that as well in Chicago but I do want to capitalize on Alderman Beal's statement in regards to Alderman Arena and I'm only going by the Sun Times statement that they said that he will be a senior advisor over the south and west side. Now you said that he was appointed before you got there and you've already looked over his resumes but I would like to know how would a young man, a former Alderman that's from the north side of Chicago know absolutely zero about the far south side of Chicago, especially out in my area.

So how will he be a benefit to the far south side that's the 9th ward, the 34th, the 21st ward. How will he be of benefit to us?

[Speaker 2] (5:41:59 - 5:42:55)
If I may I don't think the Sun Times correctly characterized how I intend to use him he will not be my point on the west side or the south side. The Alderman of the west side and the south side will be my point of contact. So I can use him to research policy for me, best practices already doing that.

He can be a useful liaison internally between the planning department and the housing. So he is there at my direction to be internally focused. I do not need a liaison between the Alderman and myself that will be a direct relationship that I will have with the Alderman of the west side and the south side in any part of the city that I work.

Okay.

[Speaker 18] (5:42:56 - 5:43:24)
Very good. I mean because I saw that being a problem especially since we've been waiting on just that one area for the last 15 years and I would like to see some investment from the city in that particular place which is our old jewel that used to sit at that particular. Now we've had many entities that want to come but no push from the city and that's what I'm expecting at least a push from the city.

I see you bobbing your hair but I don't hear nothing.

[Speaker 2] (5:43:24 - 5:44:41)
No, no. Thank you very much. I believe in planning and I am going to marshal the professionals in planning to do that.

Meaning they work side by side with the Alderman with those who are interested in investing with residents to come up with a plan and those are very specific recommendations. They're site specific. They're locally driven and as I said I have reviewed a lot of planning that's been going on and much of it is not as place based as I prefer.

They're very general in their aspirations. I look for a locally driven place specific set of strategies that I come together with residents and elected and appointed officials to comprise. So I will be really interested to see the various plans that have been done for your ward and pick whatever good there is and attempt to implement them and if we don't find the answers in those plans we will create additional recommendations.

[Speaker 18] (5:44:41 - 5:45:02)
Thank you for that. I like the part of creating for the residents because we work diligently on the plans that we do have and like I said it needs investment on public dollars from the city. But my last question is have you been to the far south side of Chicago?

[Speaker 2] (5:45:03 - 5:45:20)
Yes I have. In what area? Oh my.

I have been in your ward and I am going to go back I hope at your invitation with you.

[Speaker 18] (5:45:20 - 5:45:24)
You are more than welcome to come any day of the week.

[Speaker 1] (5:45:25 - 5:45:26)
I know he's an avid biker.

[Speaker 18] (5:45:28 - 5:45:48)
Very good. Mr. Cox I know that you're going to do a good job but my residents are tired of getting smoke and mirrors and no action and to have worked as long as I have been working we should not be scrambling to try to get development out in the far south side of Chicago. Some people think that it stops at 79.

I promise you it would go to 129.

[Speaker 1] (5:45:49 - 5:45:56)
Alright thank you Mr. Chairman. Thank you Alderman Austin. Marching orders.

Alderman Pat Dowell.

[Speaker 17] (5:45:58 - 5:46:03)
Thank you Mr. Chair. Mr. Cox welcome to Chicago.

[Speaker 1] (5:46:03 - 5:46:03)
Thank you.

[Speaker 17] (5:46:04 - 5:46:19)
We have had some conversation about your focus on the new and improved planning and development department. I want to ask you about what kind of innovative investment policies are you bringing with you from Detroit?

[Speaker 2] (5:46:23 - 5:47:42)
Thank you for the question. Every city has its own mixture of tools and resources to deploy to spur economic development. In Detroit I was instrumental in helping the city create a strategic neighborhood fund which is different than the neighborhood opportunity fund that Chicago has access to.

The strategic neighborhood fund brought together philanthropy to invest in neighborhoods. It brought together public resources that were through bonds to fund streetscape transformations and a really innovative portion of the strategy brought together the corporate community. So the largest downtown corporations committed to one fund that would specifically target neighborhoods.

And so that was one example of bringing together a variety of economic resources to target specifically to neighborhoods.

[Speaker 17] (5:47:43 - 5:47:45)
Is that something that you're seeking to do here?

[Speaker 2] (5:47:46 - 5:48:02)
I believe there's enormous potential to use corporate support differently than it has historically been used here. So yes I hope to put that on the table as well as other tools.

[Speaker 17] (5:48:02 - 5:49:11)
Because one of the things and I think my colleague Alderman Austin alluded to it it's difficult in more distressed communities to get the push that we need to get the development that we need done. And the amount of investment that the city can put into a deal is so limited that we might need a little extra push to just get that development in the ground. And I can think of a project in my ward where we've sort of maxed out on the city dollars.

My state rep was very instrumental in bringing back some dollars to support that development. But we still have a little gap. And our rules are so stringent.

And I think in more distressed communities where it's harder for the private sector to come in, we need the city to be more flexible in the use of their dollars. Is that something you agree to?

[Speaker 2] (5:49:11 - 5:50:29)
Agree with? Well I agree wholeheartedly. And all those dollars usually have their limitations.

Certainly philanthropy probably has the greatest flexibility often to fill that gap. And I've seen where that has come to play. I've seen situations where there's been linkage between downtown development and neighborhood development.

So that you encourage those who have developed in markets that are robust to partner with community developers in areas where the market has not yet discovered that market. So I'm intrigued again by development linkage strategies. And I think that there are a host of other models that other states have deployed to get beyond the fact that a market hasn't yet been right and requires a heavier lift or a deeper subsidy in order to open up that market.

And I am committed to exploring all of those options so that we can leapfrog over this gap between downtown and neighborhood.

[Speaker 17] (5:50:29 - 5:52:26)
I think that if you're able to do that, then we will see some good things happening in our community. Many of us have been planned to death. We don't need any more plans.

We don't need any more books to sit on the shelf. We need the actual development of a shovel in the ground. And so I hope that, I know you're coming in to add some more of the planning flavor to the department which we desperately need.

But we severely need the development arm or the development punch that you can bring to this city. So I wanted to say that. One of the programs that a project that under a former planning commissioner, Valerie Jarrett, she created something called the Strategic Neighborhood Action Program which sought to bring together the power of the various departments not just the power but the money also of various developments like transportation planning and development, the Chicago Housing Authority, whatever was needed to work in a very targeted geographic area.

I think it was no more than eight blocks by eight blocks. And that was very it worked mostly in Alderman Burnett's ward near around the United Center. It was a very positive program.

And I would just encourage you to maybe dust off the books on that one and take a look at how you might be able to implement that. I also wanted to ask you about going back to planning districts. Is this something you're considering?

[Speaker 2] (5:52:28 - 5:54:44)
So both questions because you are mirroring the strategy that I deployed in Detroit where I had access to the parks department budget. I had access to the public works budget. I had access to the small business association budget.

There was an attempt to aggregate all of our budgets so that we would have a kind of catalytic impact over a geography that sounds very similar to the geography you were talking about. You could walk from one improvement from one opportunity site to another if you look at how the neighborhood frameworks were conceived of. So I smile as you described it because you were describing the strategy that I've just deployed over the past five years.

The other reason we were able to create frameworks not plans. These were a series of coordinated projects that were meant to be complementary one to the other. It was because we broke the city into regions where there were a group of planners who were dedicated exclusively to that region.

That was their full-time job. So if you could imagine in Chicago where there is planning and implementation happening in the northwest but equally there are a group of planners working on the west and the southwest and on the south and the far south side. I am currently reorganizing the staff that I have so that they can deliver services basically by region and even down to the ward level.

I hope by that I will be able to forge a much stronger partnership with all aldermen in all parts of the city just by the reorganization of my current staff.

[Speaker 17] (5:54:45 - 5:55:18)
Finally, Chairman, I mentioned this to you but I want to put it on the record. When you release your TIF funding to organizations or neighborhood opportunity fund dollars to organizations and businesses, I think it is really important that the department checks with business affairs to make sure that these businesses have business licenses. Thank you, Mr. Chair.

[Speaker 1] (5:55:19 - 5:55:25)
Thank you, Alderman Dowell. Alderman Moore, please.

[Speaker 9] (5:55:27 - 6:01:12)
Thank you, Chairman. Again, I want to commend the Mayor on this selection. You and I had the opportunity to have some conversations and I appreciate this appointment that she has made and I have no doubt that her heart is in rebuilding the south and west side neighborhoods and with that commitment I'm sure you have that same passion giving your history.

With that said, I'm going to reduce my seat now for a little bit because I wanted to get a little shorter so you can look at me because I was about this size when I was 11 years old and when I was 11 years old growing up in Englewood I saw a lot of vacant lots. Now I'm about this size and those vacant lots are still there. And so I'm in this seat because nothing is more important to me in this city than redevelopment.

I'm a strong believer as people talk about you got to get rid of crime first, then you got to bring in the businesses. That's the biggest lie in my opinion that's ever told. When we talked about, and I think I agree with everything that my colleague Alderman Pat Dowd has said, so I'm not going to repeat those things that she said, but I will tell you this when I was a development manager for the Chicago Housing Authority I use it clearly, nobody had all of these meetings.

When it comes to our communities we get over met. They just built and they even built while Ickes was up when crime was going down but then it was just gentrified as we tore the buildings down and everything. So companies came in, bus routes were given because it was now the south loop all bus lines were changed.

So everything that Alderman Pat Dowd is talking about when she's talking about bringing all those different city services in which you had your access to when you were in New York is very critical. And one of the things I have to say, if you don't remember nothing else we have to be purposeful and we have to be intentional and at the end of the day when it comes to development especially on the south side and the west side we just have to be like Nike and just do it. We just have to do it and a lot of our eels will be taken care of here in this city.

I've said to you because and I'm going to say it again and I'm going to just keep repeating it because a big change in Inglewood because everything we talk about, every time somebody talk on the news, Inglewood, Inglewood places that's not even Inglewood they call Inglewood. Somebody got shot, Inglewood. Poor people, Inglewood, Inglewood Inglewood but nobody is saying build, build in Inglewood and that's more important to me than anything when I look at a stretch on 69th street between Ashland and Damon which I go to my grave trying to get that built you got 90% of the commercial vacant lots owned by the city by the city itself and so until we're intentional and purposeful about redeveloping those communities that's critical.

One of the things my colleague brought up and he was talking about the diversity piece in that department. It's not always that you just want a black face in there it's about somebody being in there that understands. I am an alderman in the 17th ward.

I got 11% Latino population I never heard of Day of the Dead. I had to be intentional and go out and learn my community because I only know what I know about my experiences and then sometimes it's institutional what we call institutional racism not intentional because people just don't what? Know and so that's why it's very critical that that department have people in there that has the interest of these community areas that have been neglected.

So don't take that lightly when he talks about or we talk about having the right diversity in that community because it's not just about somebody saying we got to have a black face there, we got to have a black face there it's about somebody that has the heart for the community knows the community and know what the things that the community need. So I'm just excited again that you're on. Again, Alderman Dow covered everything that I wanted to cover and it's great that we're coming back and hopefully having planning regions and having people who are talking about planning because our communities are talked out when I say talk about planning meaning they're talking about focusing on an area and when we do that everything change and remember as you already know the businesses they look at their models different if you got so many people, if you got this, if you got that we've been begging for years since I was little people have been begging Red Lobster to come to the south side you go to Chicago Ridge everybody from 60620 60621 sitting over there at Red Lobster and so where they want to come downtown or if they want to go this we have to be intentional telling people hey until you build on the south and west sides you don't get nothing else in this city and so again I appreciate you I think we're going to make some ground work with the mayor at the helm and you help leading this effort to make sure that the south and the west side neighborhoods are developed thank you so much.

[Speaker 1] (6:01:12 - 6:01:37)
Thank you Alderman Moore let me just remind everyone not to be overly redundant we've got at least 10 or 12 more speakers and we've got two other appointments and then we have cannabis so we all want to keep you engaged and I would also because I was at the economic development even the answers we just need to shorten up things.

[Speaker 2] (6:01:37 - 6:02:35)
Chairman may I give a brief answer I just wanted to remind the Alderman that I came into a situation in Detroit that has 80% people of color, African Americans and 10% Latino and I built the most diverse planning department in the country where over 60% of the professionals are people of color and they are Asian, Latino African American and so I am committed to this and I think this image of someone who's walked in the shoes of the people they are trying to plan with is absolutely critical and I'm committed to applying all my knowledge to find those professionals because they're here and put them in positions of responsibility and so I'm going to build that kind of department

[Speaker 1] (6:02:36 - 6:02:39)
thank you Alderman Kappelman

[Speaker 13] (6:02:40 - 6:03:42)
thank you afternoon Mr. Cox I'm right over here sorry I'd like to speed up I looked at the process the planning development review process multifamily properties especially with 50 or more units I looked at some data that shows that in Chicago 61% of the properties took in Chicago took between 13 and 24 months to review the documents and in other municipalities it took 16% of those cities to do that in the same amount of time so Chicago is pretty slow 71% of municipalities take 6 months or less to get documents through the planning development what work have you done in the past to help speed up the process to get developments done because God knows we need that tax property tax revenue

[Speaker 2] (6:03:42 - 6:05:42)
thank you for the question there were similar challenges in Detroit about the amount of time it took to get higher density multifamily projects through the system and I explored a very current form of zoning called form form based zoning particularly in an area that was seeing a lot of change and this is where you can share with residents the density the bulk of and the use in form you can see what the full build out might be possible on every site so if you live next to a single family home you know that a 7 story building is not going to appear we took the time with residents to create that zoning process it took us about 12 months community meetings, socializing these ideas and most recently it was passed by the Detroit Planning Commission it took our development process which we said about 9 months down to 3 months and I think that there are similar types of assurances that we can give Chicagoans based on zoning reform so that they can arguably predict the future of their neighborhoods without having to wake up and see some unintended development that one took a very long time to happen and also was not visible so form based codes zoning innovation is going to help take some of the unpredictability out of the process and shorten and make the process more efficient

[Speaker 13] (6:05:44 - 6:05:53)
the other thing is the ARO ordinance will be under review will you be participating in that process to review the affordable requirements ordinance?

[Speaker 2] (6:05:54 - 6:06:01)
Absolutely I'm working with my partner Commissioner Navarro and her work group to do just that

[Speaker 13] (6:06:01 - 6:06:56)
Great, it just so happened I went to Mercy College at the University of Detroit I was a Franciscan there and there was a philosopher I studied John Stuart Mill who said those who only know their side of the case know very little of that and as we adjust the ARO because we want as much affordable housing as possible but we want to do that in a manner that doesn't stop up zoning because if we stop up zoning then we just shot ourselves in the foot not only do we lose out on the onsite affordable housing but we also lose out on the contributions to the low income housing trust fund how do you kind of balance that to maximize the amount of the affordable housing and do it using evidence based best practices and data driven research to make sure we get it right.

[Speaker 2] (6:06:58 - 6:08:35)
Well I think Chicago has created some useful tools to assure affordable housing I do think there's a larger conversation that this community needs to have regarding whether affordable housing should be interwoven into all housing that we do and my experience in Detroit was not that you could just contribute to a fund you actually had to accommodate the units in the building you were proposing and that was a decision that Detroiters made about having multiple incomes present in all neighborhoods I think Chicago has to have a similar conversation around how much economic mixing we want within and those options within every neighborhood I also believe that the most affordable housing that you can create is the affordable housing you already have so maintaining our current stock of affordable housing is just as important as new housing and it's often far more economic economically feasible so having the kind of trust fund affordable housing trust fund that assures the affordable housing that we have will be maintained for a very long time is another strategy that I've seen deployed very effectively in other communities.

[Speaker 13] (6:08:36 - 6:08:58)
Thank you and I would hope encourage you that when we do this process you do it in a manner so that it's data driven so we look back to see that it is actually producing the results that we want my final comment is Detroit you kind of shook things up and I think that's healthy if every alderman agrees with you, you're not doing your job. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (6:08:58 - 6:09:10)
Thank you, Chairman. Alderman Raboios, let's try to limit our time so that to our public speaker we have to tell it to ourselves I guess.

[Speaker 14] (6:09:11 - 6:09:49)
Short and sweet, short and sweet. Everybody should follow. Mr. Cox, I just want to welcome you again to Chicago and I strongly believe that this is an excellent appointment by the mayor. I firmly believe that you are sincere just by listening to you and we can only learn from this and coming from New York and Detroit and maybe not in that same order, I'm certain that you're ready to move Chicago to a more inclusive but brighter future and I'm looking forward to working with you as my colleagues will as well. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (6:09:49 - 6:09:52)
Thank you very much. Thank you, Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 10] (6:09:54 - 6:14:09)
Thank you very much Mr. Chairman for allowing me to speak. My brother. Okay.

First of all, I want to commend the mayor on this appointment. Not only did I have the opportunity to have a conversation with you but I also read your resume. I think one of the things that I appreciate is that you were an elected official so you know about getting elected, you know about satisfying the people but also you've been through the wringer with going to community meetings also and satisfying the community.

So you understand what we have to deal with and how we have to deal with it and you know everything is not from the top up, it's from the bottom up, right? And so we have a lot of balls to juggle in order to make things happen. I also appreciate the fact that you understand leverage development.

You know how to leverage things from one area to another area where things are more prosperous to areas where it's not as prosperous, which is my life story in my ward. So I appreciate that with you. But also, bigger than that I appreciate the fact that when you told me that you worked on a body where you all would troubleshoot projects for different cities around the country.

Was it around the country or around the world? Around the country and you and a group of people would help different cities solve problems pertaining to development in their cities. And I appreciate that because they give you a very broader perspective on challenges and solutions that have worked in other communities throughout the country.

So I appreciate that. But I also got to see you, you know, being in this position and being an alderman, sometimes I find myself being the only African American in the room. So coincidentally, you and I were the only two African Americans in the room at a meeting where they were talking about development and this happened to be with the wild mouth and the developments on the river and how everything is going to look beautiful and all these things are going to happen and you without any apology stood up and said what are you all doing for diversity?

What are you all doing in the areas and in the communities where there's people of color at and also where there's people who may not have as much money at? What are you doing with this plan to help those communities and you encourage them that they have to do more to address not just the nice areas on the north side and near the river but also in the areas where they need more development at and they have to challenge themselves to do things there and I appreciated that. You know, the unique thing about it is you walk everybody up in the room and they wouldn't let you out of the room because everybody wanted to show you that they are concerned about everyone else and they want to do more.

And I think with that attitude being unapologetic for injustice I think is something that's important that we have in this city dealing with our developments in this city. It's not just about the big developments and the big money because we all know and I know we need the money in our city we need people to invest in our city but also at the same time if we increase people's prosperity all over the city it rises all boats in the city. So I appreciate your attitude I appreciate you standing up and I appreciate your heart for thinking about everyone so I expect big things out of you but also I would be remiss if I did not say don't get it twisted with these guys they all talking about how much they need in their wards I still need stuff in my ward too So I don't want you to So Acting Commissioner

[Speaker 1] (6:14:09 - 6:14:31)
we're not going to ask you to reply to that so I'm going to appreciate you Alderman Burnett for your comments and I'm going to move to Alderman Wagesbeck Alright Alright Where's my gavel Alright Alderman Wagesbeck

[Speaker 63] (6:14:31 - 6:15:47)
I'll be brief as I can Obviously you've heard from a lot of different folks here about the issues in their wards I had a chance to visit Detroit and look at some of your work this summer just before you came here and it's some great work and I think Mr. Brumfield put it very nicely too that working on these master plans has really transformed Detroit you're going to have a lot of different things to work on, transparency focus on equity, focus on affordable housing but you also have the tools with TIFs, CHA funds, NOF and the Catalyst funds to do that and you also have Alderman Corrogative here which is probably unlike any other city that you've worked in or worked with you know when looking at Charlottesville I saw that you did a new zoning code looking at Detroit I've seen what you've done there the issue that's different here is Alderman Corrogative but hopefully you can work around that or with that to get things done that everybody here wants and look forward to working with you on all the different things about greenway creation, urban agricultural movement and so many other things that are on your list so thank you and good luck look forward to working with you Alderman Sitio Lopez

[Speaker 37] (6:15:48 - 6:16:51)
Thank you Chairman and I'll be brief welcome Mr. Cox sometimes it's good to have an outside perspective even though I always thought that it was very important to also look at some of the local experts but I think that you make a good team with Alderman Arena or former Alderman Arena my brief question is just in terms of your assessment of the situation from the planning perspective especially from the angle of the long-term long-time residents and families from the planning perspective what is your assessment of the things that can be improved from the planning I've often been in many meetings seems like obviously the issue of affordable housing in the planning it seems like a recurring theme I hear my colleagues say that several times so maybe you can give us just a quick assessment and also maybe a quick assessment on the TIF programming how the TIF program can be perhaps improved under a different vision thank you

[Speaker 2] (6:16:54 - 6:19:01)
I would just say my experience in Detroit was one where most residents are long-time residents it was not uncommon for me to find someone who had spent 50, 60 years in their home and while they welcomed the improvements they did not want to be priced out out of the neighborhoods that they love and so we had to put things in place to assure people that as these public improvements happen as their property values increase that they would not be displaced and so there are mechanisms that we will have at our disposal to give people the assurance in Detroit it was the creation of an affordable housing trust fund with a quarter of a billion dollars in it to begin to offset any pressure for those neighborhoods and those homeowners to be displaced so that was an important acknowledgement we didn't just come in with the improvements we also put in the assurances to minimize displacement for long-time residents regarding TIF I mean TIF is an important tool that Chicago has at its disposal I think we are going to have to use it more wisely and strategically and make sure that there is equity in its implementation there are states that have found a way around to be able to share those resources more equitably a lot of this requires some structural change to TIF I'm certainly committed to exploring those options together with you so that we can assure more equity across the city in the use of TIF funds

[Speaker 1] (6:19:01 - 6:19:05)
Thank you Alderman Lopez

[Speaker 12] (6:19:07 - 6:20:42)
Thank you Chairman Good afternoon Mr. Cox I have to say first and foremost I think you have quite a very impressive resume I give you that and there are a number of things that I've seen and read about you that mirror a lot of what I've been doing particularly using the use of public funds to help raise neighborhoods but there are some questions that I have also that I find regarding your history in June of this year you did an interview and it was talking about the comeback of Detroit and it says that when I arrived in 2015 the city had just gone through bankruptcy without having gotten rid of that debt I don't think we would have been able to attract the investment that is being attracted now that was your quote to them obviously the city of Chicago has a massive pension debt we have almost a billion dollar budget gap and my question to you is that comment was made for that city we are not entertaining the possibility of going bankrupt on our obligations as a city do you think then that everything that you propose and envision is still possible when you're coming as a department of planning commissioner to a debt laden city

[Speaker 2] (6:20:44 - 6:22:10)
thank you for the question and thank you for doing your research I didn't think the Seville weekly interview would be brought up but yes Detroit didn't have a billion dollar debt it had an 80 billion dollar debt which was stifling the city's recovery it also did not have a plan for growth it had a plan for shrinkage and you cannot grow your tax base you cannot attract development if you are shrinking and so your population is leaving and so I'm concerned I'm concerned about Chicago's debt but I'm more concerned about Chicago's losing population because it's very difficult to attract investment if your neighborhoods are not growing and so we have to have a conversation with residents of the west side and the south side to understand whether they are accepting of growth that means new people holding on to those who are there and attracting new investment and that is going to be Chicago's way to address it's long term debt so I think our total debt is closer to 35-40 billion

[Speaker 12] (6:22:10 - 6:22:24)
when you take out our pensions and things of that nature but I think the question was do you see us being able to move forward while we're still continuing on with the debt because Detroit was able to clear itself of that burden and we are not

[Speaker 2] (6:22:24 - 6:22:31)
absolutely, the city has to have a strategy for growth

[Speaker 12] (6:22:33 - 6:24:15)
and part of growth is the outgrowth of growth is gentrification basically and I know that one of the neighborhoods in Detroit was the Grandmont-Rosedale neighborhood and I know you talked earlier about your issues with the low income housing and how you maintain people in their homes but yet that neighborhood is still seeing the effects of gentrification from what has transpired in Detroit so was there a reason why Detroit was not able to stem some of that gentrification because I think some of the concerns we see on the south and west sides and indeed the entire city of Chicago is that we're building up neighborhoods only to have our long term residents not be a part of that and I can say that as someone who represents some of the oldest and most historic neighborhoods in the city like West Englewood like Bank of the Yards where you have depressed and suppressed housing markets where once you start investing in them first and immediate concern everyone has is who's coming, why are you putting in new lights why are you putting in new streets who's coming to push me out that you're worried about and we see that in all the areas and my question is while we're having conversations about growth and I know you've mentioned it are there things that we're going to look at to guarantee proactively that we're addressing the gentrification issues and not trying to do it retroactively as has been the case like along the 606 or Imperial Center or Little Village where it's already too late as people are already being shown the door

[Speaker 2] (6:24:16 - 6:26:02)
so again I appreciate the line of questions and I'm looking forward to having more conversations with you about this topic I plan for the people who are there I think the south and west side first and foremost has to stop the bleeding has to stop the loss of residents who are leaving because they do not have the amenities that they deserve so my first obligation is to them and if others like what they see and want to come I suspect that they can be welcomed without displacing residents who currently live in these neighborhoods but the city has to put in place the levers to assure that and as I said the most most effective one that I found in Detroit was the strategic the affordable housing leverage fund which went in and did a scan of all of the current affordable housing and locked it in place and that was the assurance we gave residents that they would not lose their place but I think in many Detroit neighborhoods it was the threat that these improvements would displace them they're still losing population and we're trying to stem that I think the issue of gentrification in Chicago is real so we're going to have to have real solutions to assure residents that these improvements that we're making are not going to displace them

[Speaker 12] (6:26:02 - 6:26:36)
so earlier you talked about foreign based zoning and I'm glad you touched that because I think that was the first time I heard it brought up here today would you mind sharing your thoughts for my colleagues and myself on how you view our zoning laws in Chicago and would there be any move to try and eliminate some of the restrictions and the segregation for lack of a better word between commercial and residential areas and then the variance and difference between different types of residential areas being in the same vicinity as a path moving forward

[Speaker 2] (6:26:36 - 6:27:18)
so I'm not specifically I'm not sure specifically what area you're talking about but if you're talking about commercially zoned areas of the city many that have a very high vacancy, retail vacancy 30, 40, 50, 60 percent vacancy suggest that the city is over zoned for commercial and that many of those stretches of streets will not come back and so we should have a conversation about what those corridors should transition into because they could afford an entirely new housing type live work and so that would have been my

[Speaker 12] (6:27:18 - 6:27:39)
that would be what I'm leading to then would you support then saying rather than having just strictly commercial strictly residential that we do away with this kind of dichotomy going in our neighborhoods and just say we're going to have a universal neighborhood as I've heard I know you've mentioned that within 20 minutes

[Speaker 2] (6:27:39 - 6:27:41)
of wherever your home is but

[Speaker 12] (6:27:42 - 6:27:45)
that was my signal they gave the wrong guy the hook

[Speaker 2] (6:27:46 - 6:28:33)
what I would like to say that I think people who single family housing should be protected but there are many many places where you can relax the red tape and allow for new forms the last one of the last initiatives that we just got passed before I left Detroit was called mix tape zoning and it did exactly that it tried to take a single use zoning and mix it literally mix it up to allow for a whole host of more innovative programming scenarios that happen by right on these commercial corridors I anticipate that that's going to be one of the things that I'm asked to look at here in Chicago

[Speaker 12] (6:28:33 - 6:29:23)
and lastly I just want to say that I do think there are a lot of great opportunities obviously my concern as we move forward with you as head of this department is that there are two criticisms that I've heard is sometimes your tumultuous relationship with city council which I'm hopeful doesn't exist here in this city but also the laser focus to getting to the finish line I think that and I think to paraphrase even you said something to the effect that sometimes the finish line the goal line keeps moving on us but I think definitely having a start and a finish for metrics to show that we're making the improvements will help us prove some of these visions that you're having

[Speaker 2] (6:29:23 - 6:29:29)
so that we can further implement them moving forward Thank you Alderman, I look forward to working with you

[Speaker 1] (6:29:29 - 6:29:35)
Thank you Alderman Jeanette Taylor Thank you for your patience as a non-committee member

[Speaker 68] (6:29:37 - 6:29:39)
You're more than welcome Thank you

[Speaker 1] (6:29:45 - 6:29:51)
I have one simple question

[Speaker 68] (6:29:51 - 6:30:25)
Why did you resign from Detroit and what would make us be sure that you would stay in Chicago I know Helen Moore, I know a bunch of brothers and sisters from Detroit and there were a lot of projects so they felt like the work that you was doing was great but you left and so this Chicago this could be a lot, I'm learning that myself and so what would re-insure us that you're going to stay and actually be able to do some really good work on the south and west side

[Speaker 2] (6:30:26 - 6:32:12)
Thank you for the question I tend to actually have long tenures in the places where I live 10 years in Florence, Italy, 17 years in Charlottesville It's really only been since my kids went away to college that my wife and I were able to go to the places that I really wanted to be and so New Orleans post Katrina was a place where I really wanted to be Detroit, the largest majority African American city in America, I was absolutely fascinated by their recovery story and what I could do to contribute to that and then I have to say I was very content with the work we were doing in Detroit and Mayor Lightfoot got elected and I saw a historic opportunity that we are going through right now and her vision for bringing equitable development to all parts of this city was compelling and so it just took one conversation with her, one interview that made me understand that this is the real deal this is an opportunity like Chicago has never seen and I wanted to be a part of it and I wanted to be a long part of it and so I love cities, I love big cities and Chicago meets that bill, I love beautiful cities I love cities where there is work to be done on questions of equity and I think that Chicago has the opportunity to be the national leader in this space and that's what attracted me to Chicago and that's what's going to keep me here

[Speaker 68] (6:32:13 - 6:32:14)
Wasn't a paycheck?

[Speaker 1] (6:32:15 - 6:32:38)
You may not realize but I took a pay cut to come here from Detroit Well maybe you really want to be here Alderman Leslie Harrison Thank you I know Michelle Smith is there Do your kids know where you are now? Yes they do

[Speaker 15] (6:32:39 - 6:38:26)
I see all that moving, you said once the kids left and you started moving, I was just wondering if you'd let them know So anyway, now that I have the information that I need from you which is on that card, we are going to talk but I want to talk a little bit about the Department of Planning and Development and the challenges that I've had over the past couple of decades I've had a Department of Planning and Development that hasn't planned or developed anything in my ward They have not been the ones to initiate anything The things that have come in my ward and I'm very proud of are things that I have been able to achieve because of personal relationships that I've had and then the department comes in on the back end but that's not what we have a Department of Planning and Development for So I think that you need to take a look at the department and how it functions or how it doesn't function We used to have people that were assigned to our areas or our districts that we could be in touch with I don't know, that has not happened over the past eight years So I think that would help us but I really want to talk to you about changing a corporate mindset because a lot of the challenges we face in our communities are about changing a corporate mindset They say in order to get a Starbucks you need a traffic count of blah blah blah and a median income of blah blah blah and blah blah blah and so my first go around I'm like well I got blah and I got blah and I got blah and so over the years what I have come to discover is that there is a corporate discrimination against communities and I'll give my grocery store as an example or a lack thereof Six years to get a grocery store I know that people have a need I know this for sure that they have a need to eat everyday I know that and the way that corporate America looks at communities of color as if they don't have the need to do some of the basic things that human beings have the basic need to do I know that there are poor white communities I know that there are working class white communities throughout the United States that have grocery stores but this seems to be something unique to communities of color and so I have been working to try to change that mindset and I like the things you talk about the linkage when we did that maybe 15 years ago it worked we did the Sears downtown and then the Sears out south on 79th street in my ward so I'm glad to hear you talking about that but we have to make sure that there is equity invested in all of our communities and not just 2 billion for the north side and 500,000 for the south side which has been the practice that has been the practice I think that you need to look and review and overhaul the SSA program because that is putting tax dollars into the hands of people that have no obligation no responsibility no culpability to the citizens of the city of Chicago and I hear everybody talk about what is this automatic prerogative it is our job it is our responsibility to represent our communities that is what we were elected to do and to push that off on someone else is not a prerogative it is contrary to that it is not doing our job so I think that we need to work on that and when we are talking about housing I like what you said about the affordability but I think that we need when we are looking at neighborhoods all of them are not just low income neighborhoods and the people that I see and the people that are leaving are the middle class retirees that have been in their homes or their condos or their cooperatives for 50 years and can no longer afford to stay there their kids have gone off to school we have no relief for them and I know that there are other cities and agreements that they have done where they have provided city dollars or created a fund where they can get work on their roofs or windows some of those big ticket items that will help seniors stay in or even help condo associations or people in condos stay in the buildings because they can't get another assessment if they have to repair a roof or get new windows because they are on a fixed income so not just looking at the low end but looking at the median and those that are that have withstood the storm if you will withstood the storm so you know I am looking forward to working with you I'm actually excited that you're bringing some new ideas but you know you've got to deal with the department and clean house in there and get some people that really want to help move these communities forward as opposed to and I'm going to use the quote of my colleague to the north of me Alderman King do the slow walk through projects on the south side so I look forward to working with you

[Speaker 2] (6:38:26 - 6:38:30)
thank you very much for your comments I look forward to working with you

[Speaker 1] (6:38:32 - 6:38:38)
we're going to ask Alderman Michelle Smith and then Alderman Villegas to close

[Speaker 25] (6:38:40 - 6:39:15)
thank you I'll be very brief Mr. Chairman, Mr. Cox I'm over here back in the back row I will just say thank you for our short conversation earlier today and I appreciate your offer to meet with me about the topics that we were discussing and I'm going to hold you to it and I think that this is an excellent pick by our mayor you bring a wealth of information, experience and background particularly planning that I think our department has sorely needed so thank you very much and I wish you well thank you

[Speaker 2] (6:39:15 - 6:39:21)
I look forward to following up on our conversations from earlier today

[Speaker 1] (6:39:22 - 6:39:23)
Alderman Villegas

[Speaker 2] (6:39:23 - 6:39:24)
thank you Mr. Chairman

[Speaker 44] (6:39:26 - 6:41:11)
Acting Commissioner Maurice Cox I think this is a great selection by the mayor but as I mentioned before I think that the non-planning department has a long way to go and I look forward to working with you as you heard some of the stories the south and west sides of the city have not had investments and really the planning department has not taken a strategic look at some of the assets that we have in other parts of the city as well so on the northwest side of the city where the median household income in my ward is about $57,000 I've taken the action of actually creating a brochure in order to attract developers something that I feel that the department of planning should have been doing in order to attract businesses and development to my ward unfortunately that hasn't taken place so I know that we talked and you had about 15 planners in Detroit I'm sorry 40 planners in Detroit and Chicago had 15 planners and I think that we need to take a look at putting a planner per ward so that way together we can put a comprehensive plan to invest in this whole city and I want to echo some of my comments regarding cleaning house you have some holdovers that the message of investing in the neighborhoods is not something that they're following through on and care to even deal with and I just want to make sure that you bring on new people in your team that are going to actually listen to the mayor's mantra of investing in the neighborhoods and not just in the central business district no offense to my colleagues from the central business district but the neighborhoods are starving for development and we need that and we need that commitment from you and we stand here ready to work with you whether it be through legislation, policy changes, whatever it takes we need all hands on deck to make sure that Chicago is a great city thank you

[Speaker 1] (6:41:13 - 6:41:30)
can I entertain a motion to approve the appointment of Maurice Cox so moved by Alderman Villegas all those in favor any opposed congratulations this will go to the city council tomorrow

[Speaker 2] (6:41:30 - 6:41:32)
thank you very much

[Speaker 1] (6:41:32 - 6:43:03)
thank you so I'm going to move a little bit out of the order just because of Alderman Riley's insistence that we have a number of supporters here at this point the substitute or what we're going to discuss can happen very quickly yes Alderman Riley we have two nominees that have been very patient that I want to make sure that we respect their time too this is a text amendment TAD 586 42nd Ward amendment to the municipal code chapters 1710 and 1717 by adding new section 1710 dash 1011 and 1717 dash 0251.5 concerning electric vehicles and electric vehicle supply it's my understanding that there's a substitute ordinance has been submitted Alderman Riley moves to accept the substitute ordinance all those in favor any opposed Alderman Riley can we speak briefly on the ordinance I know we had a number of speakers here earlier and there's some people still in the audience and if needed our department is here also Alderman Riley

[Speaker 27] (6:43:03 - 6:43:06)
thank you Chairman Tunney colleagues

[Speaker 1] (6:43:06 - 6:43:11)
I'm sorry in the packet you have the substitute and a summary on the front

[Speaker 27] (6:43:12 - 6:46:32)
very good and it's a pretty straightforward ordinance but let me provide just a brief explanation I think as we all know electric vehicles are the future of the auto industry and there is going to be a dramatically increased demand for charging stations in the coming years this ordinance applies to new construction only that's very important to emphasize it does not impact existing buildings at all over time we've learned that it is far more affordable to install electric vehicle electrical panels the infrastructure needed to install charging stations during new construction cost estimates are just a few thousand dollars in added cost to the overall construction project and that is easily absorbed by any developers pro forma on the other hand we've learned that it is exorbitantly cost prohibitive to retrofit existing buildings and garages to install electric vehicle infrastructure to allow for charging stations one example brought up during testimony earlier today a building interested in retrofitting to allow for charging stations would cost them over a million dollars to do that had this ordinance been in place the developer would have built that infrastructure out to the tune of maybe twenty thousand dollars that's very important this ordinance is reasonable and will ensure that new buildings have the infrastructure in place to allow them at a future time to add electrical vehicle charging stations as they see fit we also heard testimony earlier about the trend we are seeing a substantial uptick in the sale of electric vehicles not just the high end Teslas but throughout the spectrum of that product and I think because that's the future and because there will be increased demand over time and there will be a need for infrastructure to charge these things this is a good forward looking ordinance and that's why it enjoys the support of the citizens utility board the Illinois Environmental Council, the Sierra Club and the Environmental Defense Fund one last thing chairman during testimony the supporters referenced two different ordinances out there one they termed as stronger and one they termed as weaker I'm the sponsor of both my preference would have been to have moved the stronger ordinance today that would have kicked in for new construction of multi-unit buildings with five units or more and it would require the installation of this technology into 20% of the garage base that would make us a national leader in electric vehicle technology support I think we're missing an opportunity here today you did not hear a single opponent testify against the stronger ordinance today and I was disappointed to learn that there are no opponents yet we've been asked to move a weaker ordinance that said progress is better than none at all I'm going to ask my colleagues to push this ordinance forward but my hope is that we can come back and revisit this issue in the next month or two and consider passing that stronger ordinance and being a national leader in this space as Chicago should be I'd be happy to answer any questions my colleagues may have chairman

[Speaker 1] (6:46:32 - 6:47:53)
thank you alderman Riley do we have questions for the alderman on this incremental ordinance okay hearing no questions I have a motion from alderman David Moore to move to pass on this all those in favor and there any opposed opinion chair the chair the ayes have it and we'll report it out as amended okay now we're going back to appointments mayoral appointment 1922 that being the appointment of hollow I'm sorry hollow Aguirre Serrano as a member of the commission on Chicago landmarks for a term effective immediately and expiring March 11th 2023 to succeed Carmen Rossi whose term has expired come on up come on up right over here good afternoon

Bond Jr. who has resigned Ms. Reyes let me start by thanking you for your patience

[Speaker 51] (6:52:30 - 6:54:26)
I will be very brief thank you Chairman Taney and members of the committee my name is Guacalda Reyes and I'm honored to be in front of you seeking confirmation to my appointment as a member of the Chicago plan commission I am originally from Santiago, Chile but I call Chicago my home since 1990 I have lived for the last 20 years in Pilsen so I am a resident of the 24th ward I don't know where my alderman is but I know he's around here I believe I've been given this opportunity as I bring more than 20 years of experience and knowledge working in the field of community development I graduated from UIC with a master's in urban planning and development early 1990 for 20 years I worked at the resurrection project where my main responsibility was to develop affordable housing and community facilities such as high schools, student dorms a student resource center and a daycare facility I have worked in Pilsen, Little Village, Back of the Yards and now in my current capacity as the vice president of real estate development for Bigger Dye Redevelopment Corporation I work to serve the communities of Westtown Humboldt Park, Logan Square, Hermosa and Avondale.

I believe my experiences have allowed me to recognize that every community has assets to offer and it is possible to transform this invested neighborhood into a neighborhood of choice. I commit to working hard along with my colleagues from the plan commission and with all of you aldermen and older women to contribute to make Chicago a more equitable city Thank you We do have a couple of the aldermen that would like to speak on this Alderman Rodriguez is first Chairman, I want to congratulate you on saying Wacolda Reyes name very well.

[Speaker 42] (6:54:26 - 6:55:14)
Good job Wacolda and I have done a lot of work together on the southwest side of Chicago. Wacolda comes in with a vast experience in creating affordable housing I think your work at the resurrection project was absolutely tremendous. I don't know your work currently but I'm sure that you're going to bring that vast experience that you've had previously and really be a community thinker A thinker first of community development from a residence perspective.

From a perspective that I think needs more attention and I welcome you and I look forward to your service here and I highly recommend your appointment. Thank you alderman Alderman Roboyas Two words chairman.

[Speaker 14] (6:55:15 - 6:55:23)
Bienvenida y felicidades Thank you sir Other members of the committee.

[Speaker 12] (6:55:23 - 6:56:49)
Alderman Lopez Thank you chairman Thank you Ms. Reyes for staying. I am familiar with your work in Back of the Yards and I do not support this appointment. I don't find your words that you work with communities as truthful as they should be.

It's been my interaction with your role in the resurrection project in Back of the Yards to be oftentimes less than forthcoming and less than appreciative of what the people in the community want I cannot support this appointment as well as the fact that I'm also concerned about your commitment to working with companies, minority companies through the various roles that you've worked with. It seems that they are always lopsided towards who gets the work and I have serious concerns when it comes towards paying fair wages as was the case on a project in a different part of my ward that you were associated with that actually told contractors that they did not have to pay a fair wage until they actually received a check from the city of Chicago that workers could be paid half what their earnings were until a check was received.

All of that I find disturbing and I would encourage my colleagues to take a second look before moving forward. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (6:56:53 - 6:56:56)
Alderman Sitio Lopez and then we'll do Alderman Villa.

[Speaker 37] (6:56:58 - 6:58:11)
Thank you, Chairman. I'll be brief. I think it's important to separate the individual versus the organizations where they work.

I think I personally know Ms. Wacol as a strong advocate of affordable housing. I think that is something that cannot be questioned. I think we can all have agreements and disagreements but in terms of the advocacy and the strong advocacy for affordable housing in the Pilsen community I will definitely attest that Ms. Wacol is being an advocate for the community and I just want to make sure that things are not confused, the individual versus the organizations and some other things that maybe were mentioned in this committee. So I welcome obviously the appointment of affordable housing advocates like Wacolda not only in the Pilsen community but across the city. We need more strong advocates and I know that not only Wacolda supports affordable housing but living wages as well. So I want to make sure that for the record that is clarified.

Thank you. Thank you Wacolda.

[Speaker 1] (6:58:14 - 6:58:14)
Alderman Villegas.

[Speaker 44] (6:58:15 - 6:58:38)
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Again another stellar appointment by Mayor Lightfoot. Imagine that.

A planner going to the plan commission. Imagine that. Looking forward to working with you as you take a look at investing in the neighborhoods finding out what this city should be doing as a planner.

So I look forward to supporting you. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (6:58:39 - 6:59:07)
Any other questions committee members? Hearing none, I have a motion move to pass on the amendment of Wacolda Reyes and Chicago Plan Commission Alderman Riley. Moves do pass on the amendment.

All in favor say aye. Any opposed? We have one no.

Alderman Lopez. Continue to share the ayes have it. Congratulations and look forward to working with you on the plan commission.

[Speaker 51] (6:59:07 - 6:59:07)
Thank you Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (6:59:09 - 6:59:33)
Next item is mayoral application 1919. This is an amendment of the municipal code section 2-120-600 regarding Chicago Landmark Commission membership. Deanna Cavallo of the Landmarks Department will speak on the ordinance.

Deanna come down.

[Speaker 61] (6:59:44 - 7:01:21)
Thank you Chairman Tony. For the record my name is Deanna Cavallo and I'm with the Department of Planning and Development. The proposed amendment to section 2-120-600 of the municipal code eliminates the restriction whereby the mayor and the city councilor are limited to replacing no more than four members of the commission on the Chicago Landmarks in one year period.

Commission members serve without compensation. Their term is four years and until a successor is appointed. The term of service for all current commission members expired on March 11, 2019 but they continue to serve until such time as new members are appointed or they are reappointed.

This amendment would provide flexibility to the serving commission members by not limiting their ability to leave should they need to or desire to particularly at the end of their four year term and if the mayor has already appointed four new members that year. Without this amendment conditions could arise where members that are not being replaced must stay or the position remain vacant if they do leave for the remainder of that year. In addition none of the other GPD related boards and commissions such as the Zoning Board of Appeals the Chicago Plan Commission and the Community Development Commission limits the replacement of members to four per year.

On behalf of the Department of Planning and Development I recommend passage of this amendment regarding the Chicago Landmark Commission membership. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (7:01:23 - 7:05:46)

They've already told me that your boyfriend is an insipid bore. You want to go out, but it's so cold outside. Your friend says that he's jealous and doesn't want me to be your friend.

He suspects that I'm a pirate and that I'll steal his flower. Don't be surprised if one night I enter your room and make you mine again. You know my mistakes and the selfishness of being the owner of your life.

You're mine, mine, mine. Don't play dumb, I'm fine, you already knew that. If you get married on your wedding day, I'll tell your husband with a smile that you're just a woman who loves because you're still mine.

You know you've got just the word it takes Because it takes more than that To stay awake with me Takes more than a lifetime To prove that I'll be true And it takes somebody special To make me say I do And, baby, you've got what it takes Well, well Mmm... You know you've got just the word it takes Because it takes more than an effort To stay awake with me And it takes more than a lifetime To prove that I'll be true And it takes somebody special To make me say I do I'm leaving But what if he hopes me?

[Speaker 3] (9:14:55 - 9:15:39)

[Speaker 28] (9:30:35 - 9:30:51)
Good evening

[Speaker 1] (9:30:55 - 9:31:49)
We are reconvening The zoning Committee meeting at the hour of 730 if I'm not mistaken all right so obviously there's been a lot of negotiations back and forth on the ordinance in order to for us to clarify what we're hopefully you have come to an agreement upon I'm gonna ask Patrick Murphy our zoning administrator to give a synopsis over some of the most important parts that we will get somewhat of an agreement we're gonna hope to recess after to 9 a.m. tomorrow for us to absorb it overnight and to see if we can we're gonna draft it we're working on it and so let's start with Patrick I'm sure we'll have some questions okay thank you good evening

[Speaker 42] (9:31:49 - 9:32:53)
for the record my name is Patrick Murphy with the Department of Planning the following three changes are what was agreed to from a zoning district standpoint the DC downtown core and DX downtown mixed-use will allow for the dispensary and cannabis functions as a special use only the m2 and m3 districts will allow for the same special use allowances only and the c2 and the c3 district will allow for the special uses including retail functions of cannabis the exclusion zone southern boundary will be moved north one block to Van Buren and then thirdly upon the introduction of a petition for a moratorium in a precinct there will be a 90-day stay permitted from future ZBA hearings pertaining to that location similar to the Airbnb that's it but we

[Speaker 1] (9:32:53 - 9:33:04)
got work to do overnight I would ask that our colleague Alderman Irvin has the floor thank you mr.

[Speaker 33] (9:33:04 - 9:33:27)
chairman as relates to the changes that have just been mentioned is it possible to have that substitute ordinance delivered to us this evening so that we can review it and so we can come in 9 9 a.m. and move forward as need be yes yes yes thank you Alderman David Moore are we having

[Speaker 9] (9:33:27 - 9:33:30)
debate on this tonight are we trying to wait till 9 a.m. and try to squeeze

[Speaker 1] (9:33:30 - 9:34:04)
debate in in an hour well I think I think in order to debate we need to see the ordinance in its form if there's any particulars that you are concerned about we have our department over here I would ask that you have your questions we've been going back and forth but I don't think I'm open for debate I mean if this is something serious that you wanted to bring up I would you like to

[Speaker 9] (9:34:05 - 9:35:58)
a question I mean and I guess it'll come up tomorrow before passage I mean I guess it can wait until tomorrow before passage but at the end of the day it doesn't meet the equity portion that we were after for me I think we ask that this be that these dispensaries haven't not go out for another six months to have equal footing for everyone because at the end of the day there's no social equity there was a young lady named Rhonda Thompson that got up and spoke and said she wanted to be one of the first dispensaries even with the issue of the lottery it's not fair we got to talk about you know how that's weighted and I understand because this is a mayor that I totally support but right now I know we are in a position because I'm not the mayor when we have to go to Springfield and ask Springfield for things but I think at the end of the day if this body comes together especially this black caucus and go to a governor that came to us asking for our support we can go to that governor and ask for the things that we want for our community as relates to equity when day one when there's no African-Americans opening up a dispensary that's not equity on day one or day two or day three or the next one when there's more opening up an additional one there are no African-Americans and so this is a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity for us to get this right for for for equity peace I don't know if you all know but to me this is the banana in the tailpipe okay

[Speaker 1] (9:35:58 - 9:36:30)
so we've been and I'm not gonna we've been I don't want to I can yield to all of an urban if he wants to talk about it but I think I personally think we've got to rest on this overnight we've got to bring this up tomorrow with the ordinance and the in the we talked about the overview and the agreements that have met with black caucus and I think when we see it in writing tomorrow morning I think we'll be able to vote it up and down all right then I'll talk

[Speaker 16] (9:36:30 - 9:37:37)
about it more tomorrow Alderman Beal to Alderman Moore's point you know we were fighting very hard to try to get some inclusion for the black and brown community to be able to benefit from a product that has locked our community up and now we now we're being locked out of opportunities to be able to capitalize on a product that is now being legalized there's nothing in this ordinance and there's nothing in the provisions that our zoning director just mentioned will address the revenue stream that can help the black and brown community there's no path in this current ordinance that will help right the wrong for our community and so while we're sleeping on it maybe we can sleep on trying to figure out how we're going to include the black and brown community in these dispensaries because right now it does not address that thank you Alderman Beal any other

[Speaker 1] (9:37:37 - 9:37:52)
comments so I'm going to ask for a recess till 9 a.m. tomorrow morning thank you have a good evening and the ordinance approximately what time okay

[Speaker 23] (9:37:52 - 9:38:04)
all right thank you very much meeting is adjourned it's been a long day folks

[Speaker 77] (9:38:04 - 9:38:04)
been a long day
