[Speaker 2] (25:31 - 28:32)
Folks, folks, everyone take your seats, we'll begin in just a moment. Thank you. Morning.

It is 1021am on June 11, 2024, and the meeting, this meeting of the Chicago City Council's Committee on Zoning Landmarks and Building Standards is called to order. We'll start with a roll call. Vice Chair Lawson is present, Alderman LaSparta, Alderman Hopkins, Alderman Dowell, Alderman Hall, we'll get to, Alderman Harris, Alderman Beal, Alderman Ramirez, Alderman Moore, Alderman Mosley, Alderman Moore, Alderman Sancho Lopez, Alderman Fuentes, we'll see later, Alderman Barnett, Alderman Cruz, Alderman Conway, Alderman Ramirez Rosa, Alderman Villegas, Alderman Riley, Alderman Knudsen, Alderman Clay. We have 10 members, we have a quorum, I also see Alderman Napolitano, Alderman Lee for notes, great, thank you. Alders Fuentes, Hall, and Moore have requested to attend this meeting by remote means of the provisions of Rule 59 due to unrelated circumstances, Alder LaSparta makes a motion to approve the Alders' requests, all in favor say aye, any opposed say nay, any that share the ayes have it, welcome Alders.

Thank you so much. We have one item to be deferred, it can be found on page 8, file number 22425, the address commonly known as 3631-3657 North Central and 5547-5557 West Waveland, no questions by committee members, Alder Cruz makes a motion to defer the previously listed items, all in favor say aye, any opposed say nay, any that share the ayes have it, and the items are deferred. At this time, we will begin the public comment period, public comment period will be limited to 30 minutes, out of respect for everyone's time, each speaker is limited to 3 minutes, actually, we had 12 come in, so I'm going to let 12 speak for today's hearing, we will hear from them now.

First up is Molly Fleck, who will be followed by Sud Saraswat, please step to the microphone.

[Speaker 32] (28:36 - 30:10)
Good morning, my name is Molly Fleck, and I live in Lincoln Park in the second ward, and I'm here to speak today in favor of two items actually on today's agenda, the development of 2033 North Kingsbury and the ordinance to legalize ADUs citywide. I'm a board member of the Sheffield Neighborhood Association, and last week our board voted in support of the development at 2033 North Kingsbury. Neighbors in the area have valid concerns about transportation infrastructure in the area accommodating an influx of thousands of new residents between Lincoln Yards and the development of the Clybourne corridor overall, and I hope that CDOT and the CTA will work together to bring new transit like a Clybourne bus, protected bike lanes on Clybourne, and a bus lane for the number 73 bus on Cortland to fruition, so the area doesn't become total car gridlock. But Lincoln Park needs more housing, and the development at 2033 North Kingsbury helps to fulfill that need.

And so does the ADU ordinance. So currently it's illegal for Lincoln Parkers to build ADUs, legalizing ADUs citywide will create naturally affordable housing and it will gently densify transit serve neighborhoods like mine. I would love to build an ADU in my backyard.

I currently live in a single family home, that's an eight minute walk to the brown line and it's zoned RT4, but I can't utilize that unused zoning capacity of my home. And I think that that should be my choice as a homeowner whether I would like to build an ADU and not the city council's decision to make for me. So I'm here to support the ADU ordinance and hope that all homeowners in the city of Chicago will have the ability that certain homeowners currently do under the pilot program.

Thank you.

[Speaker 2] (30:10 - 30:21)
Thank you, Ms. Fleck. We have Alderwoman Clay here for purposes of quorum. Next up is Sud Saraswat, followed by Catherine Darmstadt.

[Speaker 33] (30:26 - 32:07)
Hi, nice to meet you. I am actually a resident of Old Town, but I do also own property elsewhere in the city. And I am in, I am pro for this particular bill.

I have a couple of comments. One, it's economical, it's good for existing homeowners to be able to capture residential demand. If you're a homeowner like myself, I see that there's a lot of people looking to move into the area.

I would, I and other homeowners would love to be able to provide housing and also make a little extra money on the side in the form of rent. Secondly, it's good for businesses. More consumers means more spending.

For local businesses, that's kind of their lifeblood. Without that, we won't be able to raise taxes so that we can pay for the things that the city desperately needs. Thirdly, it's unobtrusive.

Existing homeowners tend to come out in opposition to development because it changes the way that the neighborhood looks. But when you have ADUs, they're hidden, they're not in the line of sight. Homeowners don't tend to be as opposed to it.

And so you are able to increase housing density without actually negatively impacting anybody's views. And then finally, I think electorally speaking, when you don't have ADUs or when you build housing that is obtrusive or does kind of rile up neighborhood associations, then it makes it harder for us to build housing. But with ADUs, you can do that and basically pass an increase in housing without actually bothering anybody.

So I'm fully in support of this particular bill. Thank you.

[Speaker 2] (32:07 - 32:13)
Thank you. Next is Catherine Darnstadt, followed by Zoe Lee.

[Speaker 23] (32:15 - 34:24)
It's good morning, everyone. And thank you. My name is Catherine Darnstadt, and I am an architect and owner of Layton Design.

Thank you for convening this hearing and believing in the transformative power that have expanded ADU policy will have across Chicago. As an architect, we've talked to clients across the city, both around converting basement ADU units and new construction coach house ADUs. Both cases and both typologies have provided new housing options for extended family to age in place safely, affordable, and with care close by.

However, today I want to talk about the conversions that didn't happen, why I support the ADU policy and how this expanded ordinance will improve housing across the city. We received more calls from existing and prospective homeowners who want to improve their building with a basement ADU that may already be occupied. Often these units are noncompliant in minor ways, but are serving as existing affordable housing already within neighborhoods.

By providing pathways to legalization, that allows for these housing options to remain active, to not displace existing homeowners, and to also continue to allow for housing to exist deeper within neighborhoods. Another element that we do also see is with the expanded definitions around coach houses by eliminating minimums and maximums in terms of both square footage and in terms of parking, this allows for coach house ADUs to be constructed in true accessible nature. When we think about aging in place, we want to think about how people are able to access the units without stairs, to be able to improve their properties in a variety of ways.

Overall, we feel that this ordinance and the expanded ordinance will allow to keep housing deeper within our neighborhoods, allow for more building owners and homeowners to think about how they invest on their properties, and then also to think very clearly about aging in place within our neighborhoods. So thank you for that.

[Speaker 2] (34:25 - 34:31)
Thank you very much. Next up, we have Zoe Lee followed by Janet Protas.

[Speaker 21] (34:32 - 37:14)
So this committee on zoning, landmark, and building standards, and as you know, the city of Chicago knocked down my building, and they were not supposed to. You know, they were under the impression for some reason that they own the building and they haven't owned the building ever. The building, my grandfather, my mother bought that building December 13th, 1965.

One of the arguments that David Moore tells plenty of his colleagues when they do ask was the reason why they knocked the building down was because of building violations. And my mother was working on the building, but even if she wasn't working on the building, there's a law called the Blighted Property Act 1947-1949, and a lot of people don't know about this law, but you cannot knock down any property, even if you feel like it's blighted or it's in a blighted area, unless you go to the governor. The governor has to go to the attorney general, and they have to do it.

On top of that, you guys always say that Marlene Hopkins says that if it's an emergency wreck, they don't have to notify the person. That sounds very illegal and insane, but you know, Chicago's gonna do what they're gonna do anyway, but you still cannot do that. There is a process to demolish a building, you know, and you have to go into, you have to go to the commissioner, the commissioner has to go to a judge, it's a whole process, you just can't knock somebody's building down.

But you guys do this, and you do this in the black community, mainly so you guys can have vacant lots, so then y'all can run in here and get this TIF money for these affordable housing projects, which is a scam, it's gonna always be a scam, and y'all only do it, and you don't never work with the black, you don't never use that money, because the money, the money is for gliding areas, and for like a building like my mother's, then when she start asking for the TIF money to use to start rehabbing our building, all of a sudden the building gets knocked down, instead of Alderman Moore, or whoever else was supposed to go to committee and see if she can work out something with getting the TIF money, that's the whole purpose of tax increment funding, and because a lot of black people don't know that in our areas, you guys use it as a piggy bank. So I need help, I see all these gay flags downstairs, I'm gay as hell, and my gay ass needs some help, Bennett Lawson, so since you're a part of building standards, why don't you come and help another person who's been coming here for 33 weeks?

[Speaker 13] (37:14 - 37:15)
Thank you.

[Speaker 2] (37:16 - 37:20)
Thank you. Next up is Janet Protus, followed by George Blakemore.

[Speaker 13] (37:20 - 37:51)
Hi, my name is Janet Protus, and I'm here as a resident of this city in Alderman Conway's ward, and I support ADUs for a variety of reasons, but the one that I wanted to emphasize today is the ability they give someone to take care of their parents as they age, and keep them nearby, and I just can't stress the importance of that, and how it can change the trajectory of both the parent's life and the child's life in multiple ways, so I encourage you to approve this.

Thank you.

[Speaker 2] (37:51 - 37:57)
Thank you very much. Next is George Blakemore, followed by Christina Gallo.

[Speaker 17] (37:57 - 41:00)
Yes, the games that people play, I'm so exhausted. I couldn't believe it, I kept knocking on the door, I said, let us in, so many weak people here in the city of Chicago, weak white folks, weak black people, weak Hispanic and Asian people. I said, come on in, they got to open this door, and the people, maybe y'all didn't comprehend, maybe y'all don't understand how government works, it doesn't work, this man, Rosa, he's the vice chairman, Rosa was fighting a black person down here, you don't know how government works.

I said, y'all come on in, bam, bam, I hit on the door, and this man over here said, you hit on the door one more time, I'm going to have you arrested. I hit on it a hundred more times, it's something evil here, corrupt, anything can be gone anywhere and any time and any place, but all you have to do is pay these alchemists, these corrupt alchemists, and they'll get a corrupt attorney and an irregular lot where nothing can be built on it, tall or nothing can be built, he'll become regular with money, with money, and this one-party system here calls itself Democrats, I'd be liberal if it was put on Trump's hat. Come by here, Trump, Trump is a racist, Biden is too, I'm going to vote for Trump on my way to freedom land, to make us, we've got to make America great. We tell, it's never been great to black people, enslaved us, and abused us, so again, it's very important for a man like Mr. Blake to show up and speak out. I said, y'all come here, they're locking you out, and they look like they're scared, y'all just been beaten down by the government, you don't know how it works, this is your city council, you control it, you tell them what to do, they don't tell you, so the games that people play, the games, weak, weak, weak citizens, y'all just look so scared of these people, these people are corrupt people, these people are evil people, all of them, you know what the one party system, where everybody's 69 each other, all Democrats, no multi-party system, worse than communist China, worse than fascist Germany, worse than Putin's Russia, right here, right here, and that man, where's Rosa?

[Speaker 2] (41:01 - 41:07)
Thank you Mr. Blakemeier, next up is Christina Gallo, followed by T.J. Hughes.

[Speaker 38] (41:07 - 42:29)
Good morning everyone, my name is Christina Gallo, I am an architect and owner of Villa Chicago, we're an architecture firm based in Logan Square, where I also reside. Today I'm here to support the ADU ordinance expansion citywide, but I specifically want to talk about the expansion of the ordinance in B and C districts. Our firm has ample experience constructing ADUs, both basement units and coach houses, and I want to focus on the inquiries from our neighbors in Logan Square, that we have to sadly pass on, because the ordinance does not include B and C districts.

These districts we know are inherently supportive of mixed-use properties, and are motivators towards expanding small business resilience, and allowing small business owners, who often reside and live within these properties, to have housing options that fit their needs. So with really showing support towards bringing more affordable housing options to B and C districts, we're allowing small businesses other routes to maintain ownership of their properties, and truly expand their opportunities for growing wealth within these neighborhoods. Thank you to all my colleagues who are here supporting the expansion of the citywide.

Thank you.

[Speaker 2] (42:29 - 42:35)
Thank you very much. Next is T.J. Hughes, followed by Monica Chada.

[Speaker 13] (42:44 - 45:47)
Good morning. My name is Teresa T.J. Hughes, and I am here to bring back a question that I had at the last zoning meeting in regards to quorums. You stated that you have a quorum, and according to the Open Meetings Act, you may have a quorum, but you have to have a majority.

You have a committee of 20, so you should have 11 for your quorum. Out of that 11, you should have six when you get ready to vote on stuff that are present, or the actual 11 that's on the committee. So if you do not have these numbers, when you pass things, and there's only two or three people that are aldermen here, it's illegal.

I've been doing my research, and according to the Open Meetings Act, which I'm sure that you all know about in the Open Meetings law, it is illegal to have these quorums, I mean, to have these meetings and vote stuff out when you don't have the people present. The people on the little videos up there, they don't count either. They're supposed to be here.

We are taxpayers. We are paying the people to be here. You're supposed to serve us, and you're just serving yourselves.

I had some meetings, and they say, well, you know, we have to get out. We might have to go somewhere, and blah, blah, blah. Well, set your other meetings up away from around the time of the meeting.

You're supposed to start on time, which that has not happened in a while since I've been coming to meetings, and I'm upset about that. The last thing I want to say is this 2% of black contractors getting work through Eileen Velasquez and Procurement Department, that needs to be addressed immediately, and zoning, you guys, change things up so that you can build more housing and build more this and that. I'd like to have the chair report back out the status of all these changes as far as how many black contractors are going to be on these projects when you start building them.

That's basically about what I want to say as far as zoning. So I would like for the chair to address that issue. Can the chair get back to me as a of the city of Chicago with those answers to the questions that I've just asked?

One, what constitutes the form in writing? What is legally done to make you be able to pass things out when you don't have enough people? Okay, because I'm not going to go to the state's attorney.

All right.

[Speaker 2] (45:47 - 45:54)
Thank you, Ms. Hughes. Next is Monica Chata followed by Danny Villalobos.

[Speaker 35] (45:57 - 47:33)
Good morning. My name is Monica Chata. I am architect, owner, and principal of Civic Projects Architecture.

I am also here to speak on behalf of the accessory dwelling unit expansion. We work consistently, our offices in Woodlawn, we work consistently in areas and wards that are not currently under the extended accessory dwelling unit, and we have, we are repeatedly having to tell our clients, we're telling residents that they don't qualify and they're unable to have access to this opportunity for increased income, increased support of their extended family members, increased parental or child care, depending on their needs. A couple things I wanted to add to that is that there's an opportunity to build equity across neighborhoods, and I really support and hope that the committee will consider the equity need to provide this across neighborhoods. It allows for naturally occurring affordability in rental for those who are able to live in the accessory dwelling units.

And what we're also finding is with the current restrictions, the limits on square footage and some of the setback requirements make it difficult to provide all of the services or all of the opportunities that these neighbors need. And this applies both to coach houses and to basement units, because we are also in communities and working in communities where there isn't access to legalizing dwelling units that folks are already living in. So I repeat, we are in support and I look forward to hearing more.

[Speaker 2] (47:35 - 47:45)
Thank you very much. Next is Danny Villalobos followed by Amy Masters. And everyone's going short on time, so I think we're going to get through everybody.

So thank you.

[Speaker 29] (47:46 - 49:49)
Hello, good morning. My name is Danny Villalobos. I'm a lifelong resident of Vidim Park neighborhood in Garfield Ridge.

I'm here today to voice my support for allowing ADUs to be permitted citywide and convey why it is a sound proposal. Permitting ADUs is as matter of an economic justice as it is about solving the housing shortage. As a first generation Latino, I particularly find ADUs would disproportionately empower my working class immigrant majority Hispanic neighborhood.

Here's why. This is a chance for us to shape policy in a way that better reflects our community values, supportive towards others, and a drive to getting ahead. This is a chance for us to put into writing something we Hispanics already do, and that is lending a helping hand across generations.

Why not allow a community like my own earn extra income while doing it? Let's make it easier, not harder. ADUs would bring greater affordability, stability, and support to Hispanic communities needed to advance economically and provide for their multi-generational families.

Meanwhile, getting passive income literally flowing into our backyards, building generational wealth that circulates within our neighborhoods. That's what I'm fighting for. When times are tough, we look after each other.

Why not create a safe and permitted process that formalizes the act of housing each other? This is not outside special interest looking for a quick dollar. This is about permitting an organic communal effort of stepping up in the face of homelessness and financially rewarding those who do it.

I know Vidim Park and the rest of the Southwest side stand to benefit. Let's not pass up on this opportunity for economic justice and community development. Thank you.

[Speaker 2] (49:50 - 49:54)
Thank you, sir. Next is Amy Masters followed by Eduardo Ortiz.

[Speaker 40] (49:54 - 50:46)
Good morning, Chairman Lawson and members of the Zoning Committee. My name is Amy Masters. I'm representing the Building Owners and Managers Association of Chicago or BOMA Chicago.

And I'm commenting today about the vacant storefront ordinance. I would like to thank Alderman Napolitano, the Department of Buildings and Chairman Lawson for taking time to talk to building owners across the city and hear our concerns. We appreciate the amendments that were made to ensure that buildings that are truly out there trying to lease or sell their storefronts are not considered vacant.

And we also believe that these adjustments will help to ensure that those bad actors, those buildings that are not following the laws and regulations will actually will be focused upon and also will help to keep secure and safe communities as well. So thank you again for including all the stakeholders in the process.

[Speaker 2] (50:46 - 50:52)
Thank you, Ms. Masters. Eduardo Ortiz followed by Austin Kedrowski.

[Speaker 36] (50:55 - 52:34)
Good morning, everyone. Esteemed members of the Zoning Committee. My name is Eduardo Ortiz, a member of the Puerto Rican community on the northwest side of the city.

And I'm here to voice support for the proposed zoning change that would allow for the building of the National Boricua Archives and Collections Research Center, marked in today's agenda as number A8874. For years, the Puerto Rican community in Chicago has thrived and given back to the city while always staying true to his roots. This new center is a big part of continuing that work.

As just one example, Chicago has been a home for Puerto Ricans in the city, the islands and across the diaspora during times of crisis. Chicago was one of the first to respond to Hurricane Marie in 2017 and took care of so many people and so many families. I moved to Chicago just a few days prior to Hurricane Maria, and the community rallied around me and supported me during my struggle.

What the center does is further extend that commitment to not just the Puerto Rican people, but their culture, their history, and their future. By dedicating this state-of-the-art space to the task of preserving history, Puerto Ricans and Latinos across the city have another pillar that sustains the pride and engagement of these vibrant communities. It would be a place to foster learning and make history tangible for our young people, add to that the impact that it would have on research, on local businesses and tourism, through the facility's versatile design, multiple use potentials, and initiative to promote Puerto Rican small business-created products.

Losing so much history, art, and culture to time and disinvestment would be a tremendous loss to the Puerto Rican and Latino communities across the city. Not only across the city, but across the country and the island. The center would ensure that we have a dedicated space to preserving the contributions of the Puerto Rican community so that we can build and expand upon them.

Please consider approving this zoning change and allowing this project to go forward.

[Speaker 24] (52:34 - 52:34)
Thank you.

[Speaker 2] (52:36 - 52:41)
Great. Thank you very much, Mr. Ortiz. Austin Kedrowski, followed by Therese McMillan.

[Speaker 24] (52:43 - 55:01)
Hello there. I'm Austin Kedrowski. I'm here with Urban Environmentalist Illinois.

I'm here to advocate for ADUs and the expansion of such across all of Chicago. Right now, they're only available in five areas, and we believe that we should be able to do that in all of Chicago to increase housing stock. On October 26-22, 15 Chicago City Council members filed an ordinance that would allow ADUs citywide.

Since then, support has only grown, and we have a petition to back up that number. Since our petition was started recently, we've gained more and more signatures since I last spoke in April, to the point of 1,100 people who have signed it, and there are quite a few comments on that petition. I'm here to share some of those folks' words.

So first off, Jackson said, Let the whole city build ADUs. It gives freedom to homeowners and brings down rents for renters. And who doesn't want to live in a coach house?

Interesting opportunity. More renters means more taxpayers and more funding for the city projects and improvements. From Danny, I'm a big fan of ADUs.

I used to live in one, and I think I should have the right to build one of my own land now. Please support this and other pro-housing policies. Kindi says, ADUs will allow families to stay in their homes longer and encourages intergenerational living, which alleviates pressure for care needs for both young children and seniors.

Both are constituents you care deeply for. Please vote yes on this initiative. From Laura, adding more housing will help keep rents lower.

From Meredith, I have children, although born and raised in this neighborhood, who will not be able to stay here and add to this community as they finish college because they cannot afford to live here. ADUs would help us personally and the community at large. From Marsha Rita, please provide the opportunity for an ADU in my neighborhood.

It's very difficult for my mother to afford the cost of living on her own. Therefore, having an ADU can make things better for her and my entire family. And from Alicia, ADUs are great.

Clearly, Chicagoans support ADUs. Let's revisit this ordinance and vote to allow ADUs citywide. Thank you for your time.

[Speaker 2] (55:02 - 55:08)
Thank you. Mr. Kedrowski, actually, staff, Chas, will you connect? I don't think we have your petition, and I want to make sure we get it on the record.

[Speaker 24] (55:08 - 55:09)
Oh, sure.

[Speaker 2] (55:09 - 55:17)
So we'll swap emails. Awesome. Thank you.

Next is Therese McMillan, followed by Nick Serra, and then Aaron Feldman, and that'll be it for today.

[Speaker 8] (55:17 - 56:08)
Good morning. My name is Terrence McMillan. I'm here for the Ninth Ward for Alderman Beal's proposal, and I'm here in favor of that proposal to change a lot of those zoning areas from community shopping to residential and some for mixed-use property.

Anybody that's been in the Ninth Ward or the Roseland area knows we haven't had community shopping over there in well over 15 years at this point. So I think those changes will help benefit that community, especially with the tax breaks they need, especially for a community that is really lacking resources. So we can get help with that situation to help be able to look at the way those buildings are assessed and the way those buildings are taxed.

I think it benefits the neighborhood. It benefits the community. It benefits businesses that may want to come in and help to be able to look at those things as well because, like I said, that community is sorely lacking resources.

So hopefully this type of change will revitalize and help rejuvenate a community that so sorely needs it. Thank you. Thank you very much.

[Speaker 2] (56:09 - 56:16)
Nick Serra, followed by Aaron Feldman. Hi.

[Speaker 30] (56:17 - 58:19)
I'm Nick Serra, and not to beat the dead horse, but I support expanding the ADU zone. I'm a real estate developer that's built over 10 ADUs, and I currently have five ADUs underway currently. I'll try to cover some fields that haven't already been covered, jobs, small businesses.

On average, each ADU we build, with the exception of coach houses, costs about $250,000. That gets paid to my architect and her team up in Albany Park, my framers and his crew down in Pilsen, my foreman in Ukrainian Village. On the job sites, we walk to get lunch.

We go to get coffee. We swing by the hardware stores. The butterfly effect on these small businesses in the surrounding areas where we're able to do these projects is significant.

Tax bills. A lot of folks in this room just received double-digit increases in their tax assessed values. Allowing ADUs and coach houses will increase the tax base, proportionally reducing the tax burden on all Chicagoans.

Obviously, this won't solve the problem alone, but it's a step in the right direction. For renters, the primary catalyst in our record high rental prices is the lack of supply. Supply and demand is one-on-one economics.

Increasing the supply of units will necessarily decrease the price of them. For homeowners, adding an ADU unit to your property increases the appraised and resale value of your property. Even just the potential to add a unit to your property increases that property's resale value.

As a developer, I'm only looking for projects where I can add units, and I only buy properties where I can add units. It's no coincidence that I very, very seldom do a project outside of the ADU zones. In conclusion, one piece of legislation will not solve all the problems, but expansion of this program is a step in the right direction.

Thank you for your time, and I appreciate your consideration.

[Speaker 2] (58:20 - 58:23)
Thank you, sir. Finally, Aaron Feldman, please.

[Speaker 27] (58:29 - 1:00:33)
Hi. My name is Aaron Feldman. I'm one of the co-leads of the Strongtown's Chicago chapter.

One of Strongtown's main principles is to support all types of people with different incomes and backgrounds. In that aim, I'm here to advocate on expansion of the ADU program citywide. Thank you for allowing me to speak today, Alderman Lawson.

In a survey sent out by Urban Environmentalist that Austin just referenced, the vast majority of alders that responded supported ADUs. Of the 23 alders that responded, 21 supported ADUs. If this is indeed the case that most alders support ADUs, I see no reason why we shouldn't act promptly to expand the ordinance.

Not only are ADUs seemingly popular amongst alder persons, but they are also a popular way to address a housing shortage in the city, with over 1,100 people signing a petition to expand the ordinance recently. It's no wonder that ADUs are popular, as they offer multiple benefits. First, they're affordable, as ADUs provide a new housing option for young adults, retirees, and small families.

Second, they allow aging in place, as elderly individuals can downsize while staying close to family and friends. Third, they allow for multi-generational households, so people can have family support nearby. Fourth, they provide additional rental income, and this additional income stream can help prevent the displacement of lower income folks.

Fifth, they provide gentle density, which provides new housing in existing neighborhoods, which doesn't impact its appearance. And lastly, ADUs are climate friendly. Building new homes in existing neighborhoods lets more people live in walkable communities.

It simultaneously reduces demand for sprawling greenfield development that destroys natural habitats and encourages driving. New construction ADUs are also highly efficient and often all electric, leveraging clean technologies such as heat pumps and induction ranges. Thanks for allowing me the time to speak today.

Please vote on the ordinance at your June 25th meeting to allow ADUs to be built across Chicago, and I also want to say there's some other folks here. I know we're at time, but they're also here in support of the ADU ordinance, so it's popular. We should do it.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Feldman.

[Speaker 2] (1:00:34 - 1:01:52)
That will conclude public comment. Also for a quorum, Vice Mayor Burnett is here. Moving on to the regular agenda, first matter up is the re-referral of document number O-2024-0009659 under Rule 37.

The Committee on Zoning, Landmarks, and Building Standards does not have jurisdiction over this ordinance. Therefore, it should properly be re-referred to the Committee on Housing and Real Estate. Can I have a motion to re-refer?

All in favor say aye. Any opposed nay. The Chair, the ayes have it.

The ordinance is re-referred to the Committee on Housing and Real Estate. Moving on to the text amendments. First up, we have an ordinance introduced by Alderman Anthony Napolitano, an amendment of the Municipal Code Chapters 14X-12 and 14A-3 regarding regulation and registration of vacant or abandoned commercial storefronts.

This item has a substitute. Committee members will find a copy of the substitute ordinance as well as a summary in your packets. At this time, Alder Fuentes moves to accept the substitute.

All in favor say aye. Any opposed say nay. The Chair, the ayes have it and the item is substituted.

We also have Alderman Ramirez Rosa for purposes of quorum. Alderman Napolitano, we have you here to present.

[Speaker 12] (1:01:56 - 1:04:36)
Thank you Chairman. First of all, thank you Chairman for hearing this today. Thank you to my colleagues for being in attendance.

This is, we were just talking about, this is eight months in the making, which I think is terrific because it just shows that you don't want to create something and rush it through. You want to take the time to make sure the process is correct and for that reason, I want to reach out and thank BOMA. I'd like to thank our Realtors.

I'd like to thank our Chamber of Commerce in the City of Chicago as well. Right off the bat, I know that this might not be perfect all the way through, but the conversation that you have given me and given our team was absolutely incredible the whole way. We held it a couple times because all of us realized that it wasn't perfect and there's ways that we can make this better and we sat down and we did so.

In my short 10 years here, I felt that was by far the best conversation that I was a part of on behalf of changing ordinances and rules in the way that the City of Chicago operates. The biggest reason why we put this ordinance together was to go after the bad actors and not at all go after our vast majority of good actors when it comes to storefronts. Our goal was to highlight those businesses that are staying dormant or staying vacant purposely in order to collect tax exemptions where that really hurts most small business corridors or even on the larger scale business corridors as a lot of those storefronts weren't putting investment or putting opportunity to clean up that store, make it a vanilla box, and get it marketed properly and out there. I do know the market right now, the economy is not the strongest it has been but this has been going on even when our economy was strong. When we originally proposed this, it had a lot more sanctions and rules and and guidances on it and we really reeled it back to make sure that we're not hurting businesses but we're bringing to light that there are some bad actors out there and creating this registry.

So, on that note, I just want to go back to what I started. I want to thank everybody again for the time and effort you put into this. As I always say, if I got something wrong on this, we can go back and amend it later and fix it, make it better and stronger but I do think we need to stimulate the economy a little bit more and make sure some of these storefronts are active and become more vibrant even if they're not getting the lease that they're hoping for, that they're showing that corridor, that they're at least part of it and part of the system of making that commerce a little bit stronger and better. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 2] (1:04:36 - 1:04:44)
Thank you, Alderman. I want to point out we have Deputy Commissioner Grant Ulrich here from the building department as well. We'll move on to questions.

Alderman Hopkins.

[Speaker 26] (1:04:48 - 1:06:54)
Mr. Chairman, I want to commend the sponsor, Alderman Napolitano, for bringing this important issue before us and for making the improvements to this ordinance. This is definitely a better version than the various drafts that went through. I'm in full support of this and I just want to point out that one of the assumptions that I think underlined some of the clauses that are no longer in here, I just want to push back on and that is the belief that we have a plethora of landlords who don't want to collect rent, who would much rather have a vacant building than have a tenant paying rent every month.

That just doesn't make sense. I'm sure it does happen on occasion for various reasons. I'm not aware of any situation like that, at least not in my ward, so we should be looking for ways to provide a carrot as well as a stick, incentivize landlords to do the right thing, maintain their property, put that for rent sign, and sooner or later you're going to have someone that knocks on the door and says, hey, I want to put a nail salon in here or whatever it's going to be.

I just think we need to lean into that a little bit more and this version of the ordinance does that, so it's the right thing to do. I also want to suggest that after we pass this today, and hopefully we will, the next step might be to consider additional measures that could help landlords that have storefronts. One thing that's been discussed in recent years is to allow for additional commercial advertising on vacant storefronts while they're looking to attract a tenant.

It happens now unofficially. You see people putting ads up and poster boards and weed pasting. There's a poster of an old rodeo, so to speak, on the window of a vacant storefront.

Why not allow the property owner and the landlord to do that legally, to pay for a permit, to have an advertising space in that window while they're waiting for a permanent tenant to come in or while they're waiting for a pop-up store to occupy that space and generate the kind of money that can help that landlord maintain the building, which is what we all want. We want properly maintained buildings in our community and I think this ordinance will help get us there. So again, I commend the sponsor.

I will support this and I urge an aye vote from my colleagues. Thank you.

[Speaker 9] (1:06:54 - 1:06:55)
Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 2] (1:06:55 - 1:06:58)
Anyone else, questions or comments on this ordinance?

[Speaker 9] (1:06:59 - 1:09:04)
Alderman Moore has his hand up. Alderman Moore. Sorry, I have my back to you.

No, I understand. Thank you so much. First of all, I want to thank Alderman Napolitano for bringing this, but if I could ask, because I haven't seen a substitute.

I had a couple of issues going on in my ward. That's why I couldn't be here today, so I haven't looked at the substitute, but I'm gonna give a scenario, Alderman Napolitano, and you let me know because I'm just, in a small way, not sort of push back on what Alderman Hopkins said, but tell people there are two truths. The two truths in that is that what he's, what he's seen and he said what he's seen in his community, that there, he don't believe that there are landlords who want to see their apartment units vacant.

That's a truth in his community. In my community, that's not a truth. There are landlords who purposely leave these vacant properties consistently year over year without any efforts of trying to put them on the market or get people to buy them or we reach out to them.

I can't find anyone and also when you look at tax bills, I got a tax bill of about $800 for the whole year, but I have no doubt that from their federal taxes that they're writing off much, much more or possibly, as my constituents believe, doing some type of money laundering activity. I don't know, but it makes, it don't make good sense for somebody not even try to lease out or even want to sell property. So, for example, I have one new property and it's going to lead to my question, Alderman Napolitano.

I have one property that was built brand new, supposed to have been a daycare, guy never opened it, couldn't find him, and then grass started growing up and writing tickets, people started breaking in, stealing stuff. A brand new property built and no one ever moves in. And so, when you have situations like that and they are not putting or even trying to rent, please, Napolitano, tell me how does this ordinance help me in that situation?

[Speaker 12] (1:09:07 - 1:10:07)
So, what this does now, it creates that registry that you didn't have before. It gives you that contact with that building owner. It gives you the ability on the building side, and I'm sure the building department would be able to answer this a little bit better, where we have seen, and I'd like to stick with what my colleague had mentioned, Alderman Hopkins, that I do feel it's on the smaller portion of bad actors that you'd have these rave parties pop up, these situations where there's people operating or using these locations without even the building owner maybe even knowing about it because that storefront has kind of gone dark at the time. So, when the police do arrive or the building department does arrive on an inspection, they have nobody to contact.

It takes days, weeks, in some cases even months, to get a hold of somebody to tell them what's going on with this location. So, this registry gives them a little bit more of teeth in the situation who to go to immediately as far as the owner. I'm sure the building department could answer that a little bit better for you.

[Speaker 9] (1:10:08 - 1:10:13)
Yeah, somebody answer better because I'm lost because I thought we already had a vacant building registry.

[Speaker 2] (1:10:13 - 1:10:16)
I'm going to ask Deputy Commissioner Ulrich to address that, Alderman.

[Speaker 11] (1:10:16 - 1:11:42)
Yeah, good morning, Managing Deputy Building Commissioner Grant Ulrich. Just wanted to say thank you on behalf of Commissioner Hopkins and the Mayor to Alderman Napolitano for bringing this forward. But Alderman, more to your question, so an entirely vacant building, and it sounds like that new construction supposed to be a daycare that never opened, that's already subject to registration requirements and penalties under existing ordinances.

This new ordinance is applying to vacant storefronts or similar ground-level spaces in occupied buildings. So, you may have those other places in your ward, this is now going to those vacant storefronts, maybe with residential or office above, where they are not actively looking to lease them out or actively doing work in that building under a permit or applying for a permit. So, it really is going to those bad actors.

Sometimes I think I heard in some of the references they are being used for illegal parties at night, which is a problem for both us and BACP and other enforcement departments, police, and for you and your community. So, this is going to that specific situation of vacant storefronts at the ground street level of occupied buildings and creating new registration programs and some maintenance and insurance requirements to get at those bad actors while not getting at the good actors who are trying to lease them out, maintaining those buildings in an occupiable condition.

[Speaker 9] (1:11:43 - 1:12:38)
Okay, so given the fact that we have already the vacant registry, so this expands what is already there from the complete vacancy to where there's residential. So, I get that part in terms of his ordinance. So, right now in terms where we have the vacant buildings where there's no leasing at all going on anywhere at bottom or top, and did we put something in place?

Somebody help me remember. Did we put something in place that if people are not actively trying to lease these buildings that the city, I thought it was under the Rahm Emanuel administration, but correct me if I'm wrong, what do we have in place right now to either force or the city intervenes when people are not leasing these properties or even trying to? Managing Deputy?

[Speaker 11] (1:12:40 - 1:13:02)
That's not a program I'm familiar with. So, from the building department side, if they have not registered a vacant building, they're not maintaining a building, they don't have the proper insurance for an entirely vacant building, we can do things about that today. If there's an address, you know, if you want to reach out to Commissioner Hopkins or myself, we can certainly work with you on that specific property or properties in your ward.

[Speaker 9] (1:13:03 - 1:13:07)
But I am not familiar with the sort of provision you described.

[Speaker 11] (1:13:07 - 1:13:09)
That might be something another department.

[Speaker 9] (1:13:10 - 1:14:13)
Okay, I'll get with Commissioner Hopkins on it. We'll look at it. And if something, we're going to have to have probably codify something as it relates to that, because we got people that want to do stuff, we can't contact people, and they're not even trying to lease up these buildings.

But I thank Alderman Napolitano for expanding this. And I know that definitely throughout the city of Chicago, especially in those communities, definitely that have this problem. But we have the bigger problem and vacancies not even trying to be filled.

And we can't even contact these owners sometimes. So I sit down with Commissioner Hopkins and we'll come up with something and I'll look at what's on the books now. But I know someone tried, maybe it failed under Rahm Emanuel's administration.

But we have to look at that and force these people either to, you know, try to lease up or something. We had those conversations. But thank you so much.

And I'm definitely in support of this ordinance.

[Speaker 2] (1:14:13 - 1:14:15)
Thank you. Thank you, Alderman Moore. We have Alderman Citro Lopez.

[Speaker 10] (1:14:17 - 1:16:43)
Thank you. Thank you, Chairman. And I also want to thank Alderman Napolitano for working with administration on this important piece of legislation around vacancies.

Vacancies are very costly to the small homeowner, the small business. When those are appeals or credits that are given to those who don't need it, those are ultimately payments that the small homeowner today are feeling it tremendously. I do think that there are some important features here as the registration of these entities.

Right now in my community, we have a number of LLCs, for instance. We don't even know who they are. They claim significant amount of subsidies from the county.

And this comes to a great expense to our community. Our property taxes in Pilsen in particular went over an average of 46 percent, but in many cases, double or triple. I also want to say, and I do agree with Alderman Hopkins, this does not apply for the vast majority of people who are vested and want the success of the city of Chicago, but in particular by corporations like Blackstone that quite frankly buy property by the dozens, don't even know where they are buying property.

And that becomes a big problem when our community has to now be subject to proposals that don't even fit the social fabric of our neighborhood. So I do think there's a number of things that we can do and we should continue to do to address the vacancies that again are paid by the small homeowner, the small business owner who want to continue to invest in our city and need some help. So certainly I welcome the dialogue on what else we can do to help those small homeowners that are really, and the small businesses that are in dire need to help so that they can remodel, they can actually occupy their storefront.

So I do think that this is a step in the right direction. I do think that, and I will be welcome to work with the zoning committee to talk and maybe have a subject matter hearing with the assessor so that we can discuss other ways, including the because the subsidies ultimately are paid by the small homeowner when we don't know who those subsidies are getting or who are receiving those subsidies. So I strongly support these ordinance and I welcome the collaboration to work on this line as well.

Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 2] (1:16:44 - 1:16:47)
Thank you, Alderman. We have Alderman La Spada, Cruz, and then Dow.

[Speaker 4] (1:16:48 - 1:17:59)
Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Chair. My hat's genuinely off to Alderman Napolitano because this is a really difficult needle to thread in addressing commercial storefronts in Chicago.

And commercial corridors in Chicago are so varied and the reasons for vacancies are so varied. There's areas where the rents that you could command don't stand up to the cost to actually bring a storefront into productive use. And then there's areas like on Milwaukee Avenue or Armitage where sure, there's a four lease sign up as long as you're willing to pay roughly four times the leases that everybody else on the block is paying.

It's really a disparity on how we have to address commercial vacancies. But what we have in front of us is actually solid enough and common sense enough that it works as effectively on the north side as on the south side as on the west side. That is a very difficult thing to do with an ordinance.

So my hat's off again to you Alderman Napolitano and to the team that worked with you on this. Thank you, Chair.

[Speaker 2] (1:18:00 - 1:18:01)
Thank you, Alderman. Alderman Cruz.

[Speaker 37] (1:18:02 - 1:19:24)
Thank you, Chairman. I also want to express my support for this ordinance. I remember speaking with Alderman Napolitano about this and I want to thank him for doing this and actually bringing some action into this empty storefronts and also to for showing a great collaboration not only with the administration but with BOMA, with law, and even with those business owners as well who had concerns at one time in making the changes that he did to be able to accommodate everyone but at the same time everybody being on the same page. It is frustrating to hear some of the business tenants who want to come into my ward and say some of these business owners rather say, you know, I make more money having an empty storefront rather than renting to you. That is very discouraging when we're trying to bring into you know the commercial quarter, you know, be vibrant again bringing some storefronts.

And this ordinance, you know, will empower those who want to bring that vibrancy to our communities by not only enhancing the appearance of our communities but also attracting new businesses and economic opportunity. So again, I want to express my gratitude to Alderman Napolitano for taking the time to be able to do this and eight months actually sounds really good. So thank you so much.

[Speaker 2] (1:19:24 - 1:19:26)
Thank you. Alderman Dowell.

[Speaker 5] (1:19:27 - 1:20:49)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I wanted to also thank Alderman Napolitano for putting forth this ordinance. I agree with Alderman Moore regarding the need to look at those properties where the, and Alderman Cruz, those properties that the owners are not actively seeking to rent.

But in the meantime, I especially appreciate the creation of a registry and also the requirement to remove the business identification sign if it's no longer, if the business is no longer there, it would actually help to clean up the corridor. So I wanted to thank him for that. I do have a couple of questions.

I just wanted to ask the building department whether or not this ordinance aligns with the vacant property ordinance in terms of the registration fees and the reapplication fees. And if you could speak to the requirements for maintaining the exterior that's only referenced in section 14X-12-1202.4. Thank you. Thanks.

[Speaker 11] (1:20:51 - 1:22:06)
The first question about the fees. So the fees under the entirely vacant building ordinances that we have today, we have one for owners. And then I think I worked with you a while ago when we added mortgages.

So we have existing things, certain buildings in foreclosure, mortgages have to register. The existing fee is $30 for every six months. That was adjusted as part of some fine and fee reforms that we did in the last administration.

Those fees are staying the same. There's a higher initial fee for some of the mortgages. And there are some penalty fees if we catch you with a vacant building before it gets registered.

Under this ordinance for the vacant storefronts and partially occupied buildings, the fee is $100 for every six months. And there's a $250 penalty fee if you are caught before correctly registering. There's some additional complexity to us in enforcing this ordinance in partially occupied buildings.

It's harder to figure out if a building complies or this ordinance applies. So that partially contributes to the higher fee. Also, these buildings are generating some revenue from the occupied parts of the building.

So that's why the fee is different for this than the existing ordinance around entirely vacant buildings.

[Speaker 2] (1:22:08 - 1:22:10)
But did you want those requirements as well?

[Speaker 5] (1:22:10 - 1:22:24)
Just speak to if you don't have them, you can send them to me through the chair. I just want to make sure that the exterior requirements are similar in both ordinances. And does this also cover mortgages?

[Speaker 11] (1:22:25 - 1:22:48)
This does not cover mortgages for vacant storefronts and occupied buildings. So no, there's not a mortgage component to registration for that. But back to the exterior maintenance.

So this ordinance is amending in all of those sections about property maintenance that apply to entirely vacant buildings today also apply to occupied buildings in the vacant storefront.

[Speaker 20] (1:22:48 - 1:22:49)
Very good.

[Speaker 11] (1:22:49 - 1:22:53)
About snow and weeds and things like that all apply. Very good.

[Speaker 5] (1:22:54 - 1:22:59)
Alderman Napolitano, this is really a good piece of work and thank you for bringing it forward.

[Speaker 2] (1:23:01 - 1:23:02)
Thank you. Alderwoman Lee?

[Speaker 18] (1:23:03 - 1:23:27)
Thank you, Vice Chair. I'm not on the zoning committee, so please forgive me ignorance. And I think this is a great ordinance.

Alderman Napolitano, I just have a couple of questions. Does this apply to a vacant storefront that is currently not zoned for any business or commercial? I ask because I have this in my ward currently.

[Speaker 2] (1:23:27 - 1:23:36)
I think we've all run into that in our wards over time. I don't believe we have any zoning discussion on it at all.

[Speaker 11] (1:23:37 - 1:24:18)
Yeah, that's an interesting one. We might have to look at specifically. But the intention is if it looks like a storefront, whether the zoning's there or not.

So the definition is an area within a building that is or would be suitable for occupancy for a non-accessory, non-residential use, assuming any violations of the code of the property are fully remedied and at the ground level. So if anything non-residential can go in there, not necessarily a business, most of these are going to be commercial storefronts. But we did make it a little more open and there are some uses.

So I think that, yes, this applies. But we can look at that specifically in your ward.

[Speaker 18] (1:24:19 - 1:25:18)
I would love to just noodle this around a little bit because I'm two years into my office and there are many places in the ward that were downzoned to RS3 that were previously some sort of commercial corridor. So I have property owners right now who would love to rent out their properties, but they literally can't without a zoning change, without having to go through the additional expense of a zoning change. And that requires a process.

And if there's enough community pushback, then we can't really do it. So I'd hate to penalize people who would really like to rent it out, but are prohibited from doing so by the circumstances that they find themselves in. I know it's a small sort of thing, but I think it won't feel small to a property owner who's in this situation.

So, but that's something that we can look at. I certainly not trying to hold up the legislation. I think it's good legislation.

I think it could be improved with just thinking through some of those little details. That's all I've got.

[Speaker 2] (1:25:18 - 1:25:41)
Sure. I will say this has come up in my ward, you know, 20 years ago when they rewrote the code, there were large areas that were zoned R4, right? Which included a storefront on a corner, right?

Now, a lot of those storefronts have gone residential just because that's where the market's gone. But right, the inability to lease due to zoning maybe is one of those conditions we can tack on, you know, like a trailer bill, something like that.

[Speaker 18] (1:25:42 - 1:25:47)
Yeah, no, I'd be interested in that. Again, I know I'm not on the committee, but- No, I think it's a good point though.

[Speaker 2] (1:25:47 - 1:25:49)
And I, yeah, I'll admit it. Napolitano?

[Speaker 12] (1:25:49 - 1:25:58)
Can I just ask a question? Are you talking like when you would see something like that, that house that's been converted into a bar, like that- I have a couple of- Use the mic.

[Speaker 18] (1:25:58 - 1:26:44)
Oh, sorry. I'm talking about, sorry, not my first rodeo here. There's a mixed use commercial and residential building, apartments on top and office spaces on the bottom.

When the zoning was changed to R3 on that whole block, anybody that had a business in those storefronts downstairs was grandfathered in. And I have one instance right now where the woman's tenant stopped renting and because it was zoned R3 and it was more than 18 months, nothing else could go in it. So, that's where she is right now.

So, in this case, if this passes the way it is, she would be subject to this piece of legislation and then would have to pay additional fees. So, and I have this in quite a few places in the ward.

[Speaker 2] (1:26:45 - 1:27:00)
Let's chat offline about maybe, because I've had to do some rezonings for them. But then I think also we can tack that on because, right, the ability to rent your storefront is dependent on being properly zoned for it too. So, yeah, I think we can work on that.

[Speaker 18] (1:27:01 - 1:27:01)
Great. Thank you.

[Speaker 2] (1:27:02 - 1:33:06)
Appreciate it, guys. Anything else? Anyone else?

All right. I will thank Alderman Napolitano and the building department and everyone else, our partners with BOMA Realtors Chamber for their on this and all along. I think it's a tool we're all going to find useful with a tweak or two to get right in our neighborhood.

File number A8884 for the property commonly known as 11853 South Michigan Avenue. Change request is B32 Community Shopping District to B21 Community Neighborhood Mixed Use District. File number A8885 for the property commonly known as 11938 South Michigan Avenue.

Change request is B31 Community Shopping District to B21 Neighborhood Mixed Use District. We have Erica Selke from the Department of Planning and Development to present on this matter. Erica, please proceed.

[Speaker 6] (1:33:07 - 1:38:14)
Thank you. Again, my name is Erica Selke. I'm the lead planner for the Far South region with Department of Planning and Development.

So this is a proposed rezoning to facilitate the development of homes in the Kensington area of Roseland. So the Kensington area is generally south of 115th Street and between State and the Metrotracks to the east. So the current zoning is generally B3 and on the map on the screen, the B3 zoning is in the darker orange color.

B3 does not permit residential on ground floors and as you can see in this picture along Kensington, that doesn't really reflect the current development patterns along these areas. So you can see in the picture on Kensington that there were probably 50 or so years ago retail uses on the ground floor. Now they've been converted into residential.

Just so for a little bit of background, this map shows the city-owned and Cook County Land Bank properties in the area. The city-owned parcels are the darker blue. Cook County Land Bank parcels are lighter blue.

They're a bit hard to see on the map, unfortunately. But you can see there's a lot of opportunity here for new development. And in particular, the Red Line extension, which you can see on the map, the Red Line and the proposed station at Kensington with the red dot.

With that line expected to open in 2029, there'll be a lot of opportunities for new development. In particular, with the city-owned properties, there's a large parcel on which the station will actually sit. So you can see that dark blue parcel there.

That is an opportunity for a large multi-family building with ground floor commercial and other uses, open space uses. The city actually put out an RFQ for the site, and we're now reviewing responses to that. So that's a big development site.

There's also another parcel up at 112th near Palmer Park. That was the former Gately People Store site. That's available for multi-family development.

And also the site outlined in pink up towards the top of the map is in the Roseland Medical District and is the proposed development area for new uses related to the Roseland Medical District. So in all, there's quite a bit of opportunity here for new development. In 2023, the Chicago Plan Commission adopted a plan for the area around the four new Red Line extension stations.

The map you see on the slide is for the area around the 115th Street station. So you can see on the right-hand side of the map where it says Kensington Avenue, that darker orange calls for more housing opportunities. And that's the site that's currently zoned B3.

And then it also calls for more mixed-use development along Michigan Avenue and 115th Street. So this would again focus more residential along Kensington and more mixed-use on Michigan. So for the proposed zoning change, this map is the land use map.

The darker gray parcels are vacant. So you can see there's quite a bit of available space for new development. And I'll show a blow-up of each of these locations here following here.

But the yellow outline lots are proposed for the rezoning. And that would facilitate the development of housing on those sites. So this is a close-up of the Michigan Avenue section.

And you can see the parcels outlined in yellow are city-owned that would be sold to the developer for housing. And those would be rezoned from a B3 to a B2 district to permit housing on the ground floor. And if that development doesn't go through, it would still allow for retail at the ground floor.

And we move over towards Kensington Avenue area. The yellow outlined lots again are those that would be city-owned sold to the developer. And here we're proposing an RT4 district, which again would allow housing on the ground floor, which would facilitate the development of those parcels.

So that is my presentation. I'm happy to answer questions. Great.

[Speaker 2] (1:38:14 - 1:38:20)
Thank you, Ms. Silky. I know we also have Tracy Murray from the Ninth Ward Office with us on Zoom. Tracy, did you want to add anything?

[Speaker 23] (1:38:21 - 1:38:28)
I'm actually here on behalf of the Aldermen. And to let you all know that the Aldermen do support all of these zoning changes.

[Speaker 2] (1:38:30 - 1:38:35)
Great. Thank you so much. Do I have any questions by committee members?

Alderman Espada?

[Speaker 4] (1:38:36 - 1:38:57)
Thank you so much, Chair. I really appreciate the presentation. I appreciate the thoughtfulness and how we're trying to guide development, relevant development around the new forthcoming CTA station.

With the RT-4 zoning, is it our hope to spur multifamily housing or what's being proposed for those sites?

[Speaker 6] (1:38:59 - 1:39:18)
So I believe this is under the City Lots for Working Families program. So these would be single family houses that would be developed on these particular sites. But you can see there's vacancy along the street, which could, you know, house other types of development in the future.

[Speaker 4] (1:39:19 - 1:39:30)
Can you share why we're doing RT-4? Which is, I mean, traditionally I would think about that as a multifamily zoning category. Are they substandard lots or what's the story?

[Speaker 6] (1:39:31 - 1:39:54)
They are actually quite long and narrow lots. They're different from the typical 125 by 25 lot. You can sort of see the difference there.

So we felt that RT-4 was appropriate, and especially focusing more on residential as opposed to continuing the commercial type development.

[Speaker 4] (1:39:55 - 1:39:59)
Okay. I appreciate the explanation. Thank you very much.

Thank you, Chair.

[Speaker 2] (1:39:59 - 1:40:38)
Thank you. Any other questions? All right.

Hearing none, can I have a motion to pass on items A, 8875, 8876, 8877, 8878, 8879, 8880, 8881, 8882, 8883, 8884, and 8885. All in favor say aye. All opposed nay.

Chair, the ayes have it and the ordinances are passed. Thank you. All right.

Now we are back to, there's more on the 9th ward?

[Speaker 32] (1:40:39 - 1:40:40)
No. The 11th.

[Speaker 2] (1:40:41 - 1:41:18)
11th ward. All right. Bottom of page 6.

I was going to say there can't be anything else left in the 9th ward. Document number A, 8886, the 11th ward. Ordinance referred 417-24.

Common addresses 515-41 West 40th Place, 518-42 West 41st Street, and 4039-41 South Wallace Street. Change requests. RS3, residential single unit detached house district.

RT4, residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district. And M23, light industry and plant manufacturing district. 2, RT3.5, residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district. All the women lead.

[Speaker 18] (1:41:21 - 1:42:22)
Thank you, Vice Chair. I'm seeking this map amendment to create some conformity in a rather mixed up area. You know, previously there was a lot of manufacturing in the ward and over the last several decades, more and more residentials kind of popped up in and around it.

So this is an attempt in this area in particular to create some conformity in the area. We did consult with the zoning department as to what the best zoning for this area would be given the makeup of what's in the area. So bit by bit, I'm trying to do this around the ward where, as you heard earlier, there's some zoning that doesn't necessarily make sense and where we have the opportunity, I'll be doing a little bit more of this.

So that's why I'm seeking this map amendment to create conformity in the area, make it a little bit easier for the residents in the area, if they want to make any changes to their properties, that they don't have to go through a zoning change request to get that done. So I hope that the committee will look favorably and support this initiative for me.

[Speaker 2] (1:42:23 - 1:42:46)
Great. Thank you all the women. Any questions by committee members?

Um, we enjoy having you here and happy to help get this right for the 11th ward. Alder LaSpada moves do pass. All in favor say aye.

Opposed say nay. I'm going to show the ayes have it. Item is passed.

Thank you, Alderman Lee. Next item in the 23rd ward. Do we have anyone here from Alderman Tavares' office?

[Speaker 39] (1:42:46 - 1:42:50)
Yes, I'm here, Alderman Tavares is here.

[Speaker 2] (1:42:50 - 1:43:08)
Thank you. Thank you, Alderman. Document number A8872 in the 23rd ward.

Ordinance referred 41724. Common address is 5353 South Archer Avenue. Change request B31 Community Shopping District to RS2 Residential Single Unit Detached House District.

Alderman Tavares?

[Speaker 39] (1:43:09 - 1:43:38)
Yes, so this this ordinance is to request the Archer Heights Civic Association, a community organization in my ward is requesting the down zoning of this property to a single family residential classification. This rezoning will help us get community input so that residents have more input in determining what will be more compatible with the neighborhood. So I ask for support from the committee.

[Speaker 2] (1:43:38 - 1:43:43)
Thank you, Alderman Tavares. Any questions by committee members? Alderman LaSpada?

[Speaker 4] (1:43:44 - 1:44:08)
Yeah, I just have a question. So this comes out of our commercial storefront conversation just now. This would, it would bring the existing storefront out of conformance with its zoning.

Is that accurate that it would need then a zoning change to be occupied for commercial use? Is that correct?

[Speaker 39] (1:44:08 - 1:44:42)
Yes, so this this this used to be a former Midas muffler shop and it's been vacant for about two years already. And during this period there was it was a dumping ground for garbage bags of clothing and pop-up vegetable and fruit stands. And so it hasn't been very maintained and the community organization is asking to get input from the community and work with this business who the property owner to to get input from the residents in order to see what would be catered to for the community.

[Speaker 4] (1:44:43 - 1:45:05)
And so the the notion is that the down zoning is to compel cooperation from the business. Is that accurate? Yes.

Okay, I don't need things to be held but I would be I would prefer to be recorded as a no vote on this item. Thank you, Chair.

[Speaker 2] (1:45:05 - 1:45:19)
Any other questions by committee members? Seeing none, Alderwoman Ramirez moves do pass. All in favor say aye.

Opposed say nay. Committee Chair, the item's passed. We'll vote the division tomorrow at council.

[Speaker 39] (1:45:20 - 1:45:37)
And if I could just respond to that no vote. I'm trying to respond to the needs of my community. I got a letter.

I got the president of the Civic Association like as an alderman, I'm responding to the needs of my community. They sent me a letter. This is what they want, the residents that live around this area.

So thank you.

[Speaker 2] (1:45:37 - 1:46:08)
Great, thank you, Alderwoman. We'll report out at tomorrow's council meeting. Next up is document number A8874 in the 26th ward.

Ordinance referred 41724. Common address is 2533 to 2537 West Division Street. Change request B11 neighborhood shopping district to B12 neighborhood shopping district.

We have 26 staff. Great. Alexis Meyer.

[Speaker 20] (1:46:08 - 1:47:22)
Thank you. I'm speaking on behalf of Alder Fuentes. This ordinance calls for the lots at 2533 and 2537 West Division to be rezoned from B11 to B12.

This zoning map amendment allows for the construction of a National Museum of Puerto Rican Arts and Culture archives and collection research center. More specifically, the rezoning allows for increased floor area ratio from 1.2 to 2.2. There are no changes to allowed height or setbacks required. These lots are located in Chicago's Puerto Rico town and on Humboldt Park's historic Paseo Boricua corridor.

The rezoning aligns with the 26th ward broader land use planning and goals by transforming a vacant space into a vibrant cultural institution. This amendment completed our community-driven zoning review process and was unanimously supported. A letter from the PRCC, the Puerto Rican Cultural Center, in support of this project has been submitted to the committee.

I will now pass the microphone to Museum President Billy Ocasio, former alderman, to provide additional information.

[Speaker 2] (1:47:23 - 1:47:25)
Thank you. Alderman Ocasio, welcome back.

[Speaker 31] (1:47:25 - 1:49:12)
Well, thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you, alderman, and all the women, all the persons. Thank you all for allowing us here today. This is a much-needed building.

Our museum is the only Puerto Rican museum outside of the island, and if you follow Puerto Rico, there is all sorts of climate crises in Puerto Rico. The electrical grid keeps going out, and so those museums out there have reached out to us to see what we could do. We were planning on doing a smaller building on the property where the museum is at.

There was some community opposition to that, thanks to all the person, Jessie Fuentes, who is doing a fantastic job. She stepped forward with an alternative and something that we could all live with, and actually it came out to be a lot better than what we were thinking. So this is a much-needed building for us.

It'll be 12,000 square feet of basically archives and collections, research centers, so we'll be partnering with the Puerto Rican Studies Program out of Hunter College in New York City, digitizing all of their files and digitizing all of our files, as well as the community's files here in Chicago. It will allow for anybody doing research or investigations into the Puerto Rican culture and its arts. It'll allow for anybody to be able to do that.

We had a community meeting on October 3rd. This was the one plan that everybody moved forward on, so we wanted to thank you all for considering it and thank all the person, Jessie Fuentes, for working with all of us, all of the community stakeholders.

[Speaker 2] (1:49:12 - 1:49:19)
Thank you, Aldo Anacostia. I know the other person, Fuentes, was going to try and jump in on Zoom. Alexis, do you see?

[Speaker 14] (1:49:20 - 1:49:22)
I am here. Thank you, Chair. Hello.

[Speaker 2] (1:49:22 - 1:49:23)
Please go. Proceed.

[Speaker 14] (1:49:24 - 1:50:39)
How are you? I just, I want to extend my support for this particular project. That's why we're doing it through an automatic introduction.

You know, I think it's important for my colleagues to understand, in the Puerto Rican community, and I've talked about it a ton when we talk about housing and displacement, we have to work really hard to maintain the historical memory and the culture of the Puerto Rican community. The National Museum of Puerto Rican Arts and Culture is one of its kind in the United States. We're one of the largest Puerto Rican diasporas here.

This archive center not only is going to digitize and secure the safety of our historical memory and artifacts, but it becomes an academic institution in which residents and young people can learn about who they are and where they come from, therefore becoming agents of change in our community and the leaders that we need to sustain the work that we're doing. As a state-designated cultural district, this particular archive center is not just important to the museum, but it's important to the entire vision of what it means to sustain Puerto Rico Town, and so I ask for all of my colleagues to support this zoning change. This matter will go before housing, as there will be a negotiated land sale between the city and the museum, but we want to make sure that the museum has the zoning needed to begin the development.

[Speaker 9] (1:50:40 - 1:50:41)
Thank you, Chair.

[Speaker 2] (1:50:41 - 1:50:45)
Great. Thank you, Alderman President Fuentes. Any questions by committee members?

[Speaker 9] (1:50:46 - 1:50:49)
No questions, so moved by Alderman David Moore. It's a good project.

[Speaker 2] (1:50:49 - 1:51:23)
Thank you, Alderman Moore. Definitely an exciting project, and I'm glad to support it. Alderman Moore makes the motion.

All in favor, say aye. Aye. Opposed, say nay.

Seeing the ayes have it, we'll report it out at Council. Thank you. Next up is item number A8887, also in the 26th Ward.

Ordinance referred 52224. Common address is 2626 West Division Street. Change requests.

B11, Neighborhood Shopping District to B25, Neighborhood Mixed Use District. Alexis Meyer de Leon.

[Speaker 20] (1:51:24 - 1:52:34)
Thank you. I'm speaking again on behalf of Alder Fuentes to introduce this ordinance, which calls for the law at 2626 West Division to be rezoned from B11 to B25. This zoning amendment will allow for the construction of a new non-profit, culturally relevant community center known as the Tu Casa project.

This lot is located also on Paseo Boricua in Humboldt Park. The 26th Ward once had a Puerto Rican community center, and that was demolished in 2019. So this new project is seeking to fill a void that was not just the loss of a building, but the loss of a really important gathering space for Puerto Rican elders, youth, and families to celebrate their heritage.

This zoning amendment also completed our community-driven zoning process and was unanimously supported. There is also a letter of support from the Puerto Rican Cultural Center that was submitted to the committee, and I will cede the floor to Alder Fuentes if she would like to provide additional comment. Alder Fuentes, you still with us?

[Speaker 14] (1:52:34 - 1:54:36)
Thank you. Thank you, Chair, and thank you, Alexis. Look, when we all run for office, we all make commitments to support the needs of our community, and it's why we love to do the work that we do.

In the Puerto Rican community, we have a large aging population that lost a place that treated them with the humanity and dignity that they needed as the elders in our community, a place where they could be authentically themselves and unapologetic about their roots in this community. Unfortunately, that center was demolished because a prior leadership did not have the type of fiduciary responsibility needed to keep that building up. There was a commitment made by me to ensure that I return that same sort of cultural center for our elders to be able to spend their days in and to celebrate who they are as a people.

When we think about city lots, and when I think about city lots, I think about how do we return them to the community and how do we ensure that they have the community benefit needed to ensure safety and security. Bringing Tu Casa to the Puerto Rico town corridor is a place that allows our aging populations to be treated with full dignity and respect and to feel fully a part of this community. Often, we go to places where elders are not treated the same because they're elderly, right?

In our community, we just don't treat our seniors that way. We want to make sure that they're treated as the full human beings that they are, as the stakeholders that they are, and as the leaders they are. Tu Casa is returning that space for them to have agency in our community.

We're really excited about this particular project. It is going to be led under the Gomez sisters, who are the producers of Fiesta Patronales, the largest Puerto Rican festival in the Midwest, who do great programming and who want to be a part of bringing our seniors the resources that they need. This is another project through Aldermanic Introduction that we believe is going to have the community benefit a Puerto Rico town deserves.

Thank you, Chair.

[Speaker 2] (1:54:36 - 1:54:45)
Thank you, Alderperson. I checked in on her yesterday and now she has recovered from all the Puerto Rican festivities from the weekend. That's why she's not with us, certainly.

Alderman Espada?

[Speaker 4] (1:54:47 - 1:55:03)
Thank you. Thank you so much, Chair. I'm just curious with the Dash 5 zoning, is the partner planning to do mixed use, like housing above the ground floor?

How are they planning to utilize the capacity of the zoning category?

[Speaker 2] (1:55:07 - 1:55:09)
Alderperson or Alexis, do you want to take that?

[Speaker 20] (1:55:11 - 1:55:41)
Hi. It's my understanding that there will be many uses of the cultural space. Of course, it'll be an event space, but there's hopes to also provide educational programming, such as trade workshops, and I don't believe there's a residential element to the space, but there will be different uses aside from just a gathering and event space.

[Speaker 4] (1:55:42 - 1:55:44)
Okay, just curious. Thank you, Alexis. Thank you, Chair.

[Speaker 2] (1:55:45 - 1:56:21)
Thank you, Alder. Any other questions by committee members? Seeing none, Alder Knudsen moves do pass.

All in favor, say aye. All opposed, say nay. And the Chair, the ayes have it.

We'll report it out tomorrow. Thank you very much. All right, top of page eight, document number 22389-T1 in the first ward, ordinance referred 320-24.

Common address is 2418-2426 North Milwaukee Avenue. Change request, C22 Motor Vehicle Related Commercial District to C13 Neighborhood Commercial District. We have Sarah Barnes.

[Speaker 7] (1:56:22 - 1:57:38)
Thank you. Good morning. I think it's still morning or afternoon.

Mr. Chairman and esteemed committee members, my name is Sarah Barnes, and I'm an attorney with the Americas Embarcado. I'm happy to be here today on behalf of the applicant GW Logan Square, LLC. Also here with me is the managing member of the applicant, Mitch Gould.

Before I begin, Mr. Chairman, I would like to note a couple of items of housekeeping for the record. First is we did submit a substitute ordinance plans and a substitute narrative prior to these proceedings. Within that substitute ordinance, we're actually taking the underlying zoning classification from a C22 Motor Vehicle Related Commercial District to a C1-5 Neighborhood Commercial District.

And that's because we are dealing with the preservation of an existing non-conforming building that required the additional bump in density and floor area. So, any determinations made here today?

[Speaker 2] (1:57:39 - 1:58:00)
Sure. I'll make a motion to accept the substitute ordinance. All in favor, say aye.

Any opposed, say nay. The ayes have it. The substitute is before us.

All in favor, say aye. Any opposed, say nay. The ayes have it.

The substitute narrative and plans are accepted.

[Speaker 7] (1:58:02 - 2:01:33)
We're here today seeking a Type 1 zoning map amendment with supplemental administrative adjustment and variation relief pursuant to Section 1713-0303-D of the current zoning ordinance. And that will allow for the adaptive revitalization of the existing Hollander Storage Building, which is an orange-rated building that's basically the gateway into the Logan Square neighborhood, as well as the redevelopment of the adjacent vacant parking lot into a new collaborative community-based mixed-use development. The programming for the new proposed development calls for the preservation and renovation of the existing Hollander Storage Building, which you'll see on the left in the rendering above.

It's an existing five-story structure with lofted ceilings, as such the height is a little taller than your typical five-story commercial building. Towards that end, the programming also calls for the erection of a six-story lateral addition that you see also depicted on the rendering. Although it is six stories internally, it will match the height of the existing storage building and follow the walls of the same directly lateral.

The proposal will allow for the establishment of commercial, retail, and civic uses on the ground floor of the new development, as well as some additional commercial spaces on the second floor. In addition there too, we are proud to be bringing 62 diverse new residential unit types to the neighborhood that will be situated on the second through sixth floors. Twelve of those units will be designated as affordable pursuant to the City's Affordable Requirements Ordinance, and all of those units will be provided on site.

Towards that end, we've worked with Alderman LaSpada and are continuing to work with Alderman LaSpada and the Department of Housing on some alternative accommodations for those affordable housing units so that they are available to a more diverse mix of residents. In addition there too, this is a transit-served location, so in an effort to promote more sustainable transportation and also mitigate congestion in the area, the proposal calls for an 85% reduction in on-site parking, which will allow for the provision of nine on-site parking spaces. That's the administrative adjustment relief we are seeking, and the variation relief is because the existing storage building basically occupies the entire site and therefore has a zero rear setback, so we've needed the variation for the 30-foot rear yard setback requirement.

We have worked for several years with Alderman LaSpada, as well as the Logan Square Preservation Society, towards the programming that you have before you're here today. We very respectfully request the support of this committee.

[Speaker 2] (2:01:33 - 2:01:37)
Great. Thank you, Ms. Barnes. Alderman LaSpada, anything to add?

[Speaker 4] (2:01:38 - 2:02:52)
I would only add, like, I'm glad you have walked this road together. We've been thinking and working together to figure out how to bring this property, how to bring this block into productive use for a while now. I would thank not only the Logan Square Preservation Organization, but also Palenque LS&A for weighing in, for helping bring this to be something beautiful.

I'll also say, like, even on a voluntary basis, Mr. Goltz, your participation in the Milwaukee Avenue Zoning Overlay District process, which I'm going to be bringing back to you by the end of the year, thinking about how we preserve the aesthetic character of Logan Square's Milwaukee Avenue, not only now, but for generations to come. You didn't have to do that, but to be there to see the design standards that we're attempting to bring to Milwaukee Avenue reflected into this process, your commitment to continually working with our office and the Department of Housing to deepen affordability on site, says something about your commitment to bringing quality, equitable development to the Logan Square community. And so, with that said, happy for any other questions from my colleagues, but also would ask your favorable consideration.

[Speaker 2] (2:02:53 - 2:02:54)
Alderman Dowell?

[Speaker 5] (2:02:54 - 2:03:15)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just wanted to get clarity. When you said you're working with the Alderman to ensure a diverse group of residents, it sounded more special than just providing 12 affordable housing units on site.

What does that mean specifically?

[Speaker 4] (2:03:16 - 2:04:31)
Yeah, I'll speak into that. There's a lot of, number one, there's been a lot of movement with this development to make sure that we're creating family-sized units. We have a lot of students at our local schools around the corner who travel 15, 20 minutes to get to school.

So, our ability to create family-sized housing is important, but there's also real interest in potentially increasing the number of affordable units on site, finding subsidies that allow us to deepen the affordability. I'll share with you, forgive me for going on, but as part of this zoning overlay process, our look at the existing conditions shows that while we've created about 1,000 new jobs along Milwaukee Avenue in the last 15 years, about 80% of those jobs pay less than $40,000 a year. So, that's significantly less even than the 60% area median income standard that we go with.

If there's ways that we can work with this developer to deepen that affordability, look at income grading, but also look at additional subsidies, that's a process that we're committed to, and having a development partner who's committed to that as well has a lot of value to me. Thank you.

[Speaker 2] (2:04:32 - 2:05:31)
Great. Any other questions by members? Hearing none, all the do pass.

All in favor, say aye. Any opposed, say nay. In the chair, the ayes have it.

Item is passed as amended and substituted. Okay, as amended. All right, our final map amendment then is document number 21047 in the 32nd Ward, ordinance referred 62222, common address is 2746 North Clybourne Avenue.

Change requests, business plan development number 728 to business plan development number 728 as amended. We have Brendan Penny to present on this. This item was heard and passed by the Chicago Plan Commission.

Vice Mayor Burnett makes a motion to incorporate all records and findings from that hearing. All in favor, say aye. All opposed, say nay.

In the chair, the ayes have it and the plan commission records are before us. Mr. Penny.

[Speaker 19] (2:05:32 - 2:06:29)
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. Again, my name for the record is Brendan Penny from the law office of Meltzer, Pertil, and Stell.

Here on behalf of the applicant, I'm joined today by Larry Jurczyk. He is a consultant and a real estate consultant here on the ground in Illinois for Costco and also Kaylene Burnett, who's a real estate manager for Costco and on behalf of the applicant. So, this application was originally filed back in 2022 and has since been revised to accommodate additions and revisions to the initial plans to, you know, specifically to incorporate a new bank building on the north point of the development and to incorporate the parcel on the southeast corner of the plan development, which is labeled on the image on the screen as the auto body parcel.

And with respect to that, we have also submitted substitute application narrative ordinance and plans. So, I would ask that those be made a part of the record today and incorporated into the proceedings.

[Speaker 2] (2:06:31 - 2:06:34)
So, yes. Well, we've incorporated those records for substitute narrative and plans.

[Speaker 15] (2:06:35 - 2:06:35)
Thank you.

[Speaker 19] (2:06:35 - 2:08:28)
And then again, just to recap, what we're proposing to do with the plan development is a number of modifications and improvements to the site, which include the expansion of the existing fuel pumps to include five additional pumps and six EV level three fast chargers, which is an improvement from the original EV chargers that were proposed originally in 2022, to reconfigure the parking lot so that the drive aisles and the additional parking spaces work in coordination with the right-of-way improvements there on the, what is the top of the plan there along Damon Avenue, which will include a new traffic signal crosswalk and certain bike path modifications as well. There will be demolition of existing standalone retail on the east portion of the site, which is along Clybourne Avenue to support the implementation of a new pocket park, as well as the new Chase Bank building on the north point of the development, which is at the intersection of Clybourne and Damon.

And then certain riverwalk improvements and the future expansion of the Costco wholesale warehouse, which is identified on the plan shown on the screen in blue. Finally, the substitute ordinance incorporates the expansion of the existing PD boundary to incorporate what is currently the CNW auto body parcel commonly known as 2626 Clybourne, which is identified on the plan shown on the screen in red. The applicant has undergone significant community outreach programs and sent around notifications and requests for discussion with community representatives and has worked extensively with the Aldermen's office to finalize and revise the plans as they're shown today.

And I believe that the committee is in possession of the letter of support from Alderman Wagespec with respect to this matter.

[Speaker 26] (2:08:29 - 2:08:29)
We are.

[Speaker 19] (2:08:32 - 2:08:37)
And with that, I think I'll turn it over to the committee and we have our representatives here to answer any questions you have.

[Speaker 2] (2:08:38 - 2:08:44)
Thank you. Any questions by committee members? Alderman Espada?

Not even a question.

[Speaker 4] (2:08:44 - 2:09:20)
It was a great presentation at the planning commission. Folks who want to check out the website, it's worth going back to because there it is. Really fantastic.

Not only is the traffic design really improved to get people in and out of Costco better, the new traffic arrangement on Damon, fantastic. Landscaping, great. But it really is the most thoughtful parklet, like actual useful open space that we've seen on a lot of these kinds of projects.

So my hat's off to you all on this. Thank you so much. Thank you, Chair.

[Speaker 2] (2:09:20 - 2:11:55)
Thank you, Alderman. Any other questions? I have one, a quick one.

Is this the busiest Costco? Anywhere? It seems like it.

Okay, great. It serves the whole north side, right? I mean, it's busy.

All right, great. Hearing no other questions, Alderman Espada moves to pass. All in favor, say aye.

All opposed, say nay. The Chair, the ayes have it. It passed as revised.

All right. If it's time, we will begin the subject matter hearing on the accessory dwelling unit ordinance. I know we have witnesses in a presentation to tee up.

Give us just a second and we'll start that. All right. Document number is SO 2024-0008918 introduced by 44th Ward Alderman, ordinance referred 52423.

It's an amendment of the municipal code chapter 17-7 by adding modifications to section 17-7-0570, 17-7-0571, and 17-7-0572 regarding additional dwelling units. Please note this item is listed for subject matter purposes only. We're not taking a final vote today.

We have several members here to present. We have Zoning Administrator, Managing Deputy Commissioner, Patrick Murphy. We have Interim Director of Policy Research and Legislative Affairs from the Department of Housing, Matt Stern.

We have Managing Deputy Commissioner Grant Ulrich from the Department of Buildings. And a slew of folks we're going to hear from in a second in the box. So first we'll have the presentation, then our witnesses, and then we'll move into Q&A and comments.

So I will turn it over to Patrick and Matt.

[Speaker 3] (2:11:56 - 2:13:41)
Thank you, Vice Chairman. For the record, again, my name is Patrick Murphy with the Department of Planning. I joined here with Grant and Matt from the Departments of Building and Housing.

I'd like to just make one additional comment about the introduction, just that it also affects Chapter 2-44-106 in regards to some of the affordability terms that Matt will get to later on in the presentation. Thank you. So this afternoon, we're going to run through, Matt and I, and then the three of us, or the two of us, along with Grant, can answer any questions.

What the original ordinance's intent was, what we ended up with from a structure standpoint as far as the geography and regulations. Matt's going to run through some of the affordability terms, a refresher on the requirements, and some new regulations. And then I'll go back into what some of the new conditions are from a zoning standpoint.

And we have some additional renderings that were shared three, four years ago when we went through the original presentation, just as a reminder to folks, and especially some of the council members who were not on council back in May of 2020, where these ADUs can be found, how they would typically blend into existing construction on a block. So the original ordinance, much like the new ordinance that we'll get to, breaks out additional dwelling units into two different categories that are coach houses and conversion units. Both are generally designed to accommodate the same thing, which is provide additional dwelling units within the confines of an existing zoning lot, within existing structures, without needing a map amendment.

However, because of how they're constructed, where they're located, they have slightly different regulations, slightly different rules. These bullet points up here just kind of summarize where we landed on things four years ago, starting with conversion unit. Yes.

[Speaker 2] (2:13:47 - 2:13:59)
Sergeant at Arms, we can hear the screaming from the hallway all the way up here. Can we have that situation dealt with, please? Thank you.

Please, back there.

[Speaker 3] (2:14:07 - 2:18:31)
Thank you, Madam Chair. Let's continue. Okay.

So first, dealing with conversion units on the top of the sheet, or the top of the slide in front of you, delineates the zoning districts where they were allowed to be established. It also talked about the breakout as far as the quantity of density, so the quantity of units that you could establish, and then what exemptions were put in place in order to streamline the ability to provide these units. Just from a matter of practicality, many instances of adding dwelling units to a particular piece of property, in many cases, regardless of the zoning, can run into obstacles related to parking provision, open space.

And so we wanted to create a path that allowed, in these pilots that ultimately came from the first ordinance, an ability to do these on a more expedited manner. Coach houses were a bit more expansive as far as the regulations that came into play. They were newly reintroduced through this ordinance after a nearly 60-year hiatus.

It allowed for the legalization of coach units or coach houses that had historically been present on a particular piece of property. And it also set parameters as far as the scale of the structure that could be provided for new construction. We based a lot of the calculations on the sizes of accessory structures, garages for single-family homes, two flats, residential properties, in regards to the footprint of the building, the size of the unit that could be established.

And then we worked with the fire department and the department of buildings. And this will become more evident when I refresh everyone on the pictures as far as where these coach houses can be located in the block, how high they can be in relation to particularly power lines in the alley. And so that was a lot of the guiding regulations that we had that resulted in how the coach houses were situated from a zoning standpoint.

We left a lot of creativity up to individual applicants and architects as far as how to fill that box, but we wanted to come out with some guidelines that at least gave people an understanding of the scale of these structures. There was no ability in the original pilot for both unit types to be provided on the same zoning lot, and there was a preclusion on any usage of the unit derived from this ordinance or any shared housing ability. There were also additional pilot regulations that were put into place on the bottom of this slide that put tighter regulations on the quantity of units and the prevalence of them in certain areas of the city on these pilot zones.

So looking through the benefits, for many years we've tried to establish variations of what ultimately became the ADU ordinance. We worked with other departments in the city. We also had many outreach sessions with the general public talking about what the benefits could be, how we could structure this program.

All of these bullet points on the slide are just designed to give a snapshot of what some of the positive benefits are that we feel could come from coach houses, of which we've heard back from many of you and your colleagues, plus individuals who have gone ahead and pursued these projects over the last four years, I'm sorry, three years. This is just a reminder of the timeline that we had under the original ordinance, the steps that we went through from a hearing with city council, the ultimate passage of the ordinance about five months later, or sorry, seven months later, and then the ultimate implementation or the opening of the portal to be able to apply and go through the program. We needed some time to work to establish the website and make sure that there was enough technical coordination amongst the three departments in order to process these as smoothly as possible.

This is just a refresher on where the pilot zones were originally. These are geographically locked, and the only reason I say it that way is that coming out of the most recent census and then the redistricting that took place through city council, the wards or portions of wards that were contained in some of these pilots deviated. So regardless of whether there was a new elected official in that particular ward, there may be portions of a ward that were not previously included.

Some precincts may be in that were out before, and there may be new precincts from a ward that was not previously included that all of a sudden found themselves in the pilot. So even though the geography, the dirt didn't change, some of the political boundaries were altered a little coming out of the redistricting. So with that, I'll turn it over to Matt for his portion from the housing department.

[Speaker 1] (2:18:34 - 2:34:25)
Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Yeah, for the record, my name is Matt Stern.

I'm the interim policy director at the Department of Housing. Thank you for having me today. So as Patrick was indicating, there are two styles of ADUs currently allowed in the five pilot areas, conversion units and coach houses.

For conversion units, there is one conversion unit allowed at present if you are in one of the pilot areas in a building that has between one and four units. Above four units at that point, the allowable number of conversion units is a percentage of the total number of units, which has been rounded based on the nearest integer. And so the way that that works out is that a five to seven unit building can receive by right zoning authority to build up to two conversion units, an eight to 10 could build up to three, et cetera.

Coach houses are always limited to one per property. There has been a lot of valuable conversation about ADUs and affordability, both during the initial ordinance and the recent engagement that has been occurring over the last few years since the original ordinance was passed. Generally, and this is a very important point for the Department of Housing, generally ADUs tends to be more naturally affordable without subsidy than the housing in any community where an ADU is located.

And so in our mind, this is a very important benefit of ADUs in that they provide housing choice within any neighborhood in which an ADU is being built in a range of housing cost options. I'll cite for example, a study that AARP completed a handful of years ago in which they found that in seven American cities, one bedroom ADUs rented for between $100 and $700 less on average than a non-ADU one bedroom apartment in the same city. Moving beyond the naturally occurring affordable nature of many ADUs, the zoning change that was made a number of years ago instituted a requirement that we are not proposing to change in the ordinance that is in front of you today in which any property that is requesting two or more ADUs must make every other unit affordable at 60% AMI.

60% AMI for a one to four person household is going to be that rent level is going to be around $1,100 to $1,600 a month, depending on family size. And this provision is designed to ensure that where ADU development does occur in larger buildings where multiple ADUs may be possible, that we are increasing access to deeply affordable housing in those communities. And the last thing that I'll mention beyond that requirement is that there are further opportunities for ADUs to be affordable and more deeply affordable than they might otherwise be, which is through connecting to subsidy programs such as Housing Choice Vouchers or the Chicago Low Income Housing Trust Fund, both of which give opportunities for homeowners or landlords that build ADUs to be paired with a resident at a lower income and receive a subsidy beyond the affordable rent that the tenant could pay. After the pilot ordinance was passed three years ago, the Department of Housing stood up a application portal at Chicago.gov slash ADU. This website is the starting point for anyone who wants to build a accessory dwelling unit in the city. And we expect this portal to be continued in the event that a citywide expansion of ADUs is passed here. When an applicant goes to this website, they will be able to access a wide variety of supporting and informational documentation.

They can also submit for preapproval through the Department of Housing. This preapproval process is a relatively streamlined process in which today we're checking to make sure that a homeowner is in a pilot area, looking at their existing number of units, determining the number of units they would be able to build. And in those areas, in those pilot areas with the special requirements in the pilot, we are going through a special confirmation process that an applicant has met those thresholds.

Additionally, this is also where we confirm that applicants have complied with the Aldermanic and Neighbor Notification requirements and confirm that any applicant who is obligated to do an affordable conversion unit has submitted the necessary documentation for that. Once DOH issues a preapproval, at that point, an applicant can move on via a standard Department of Buildings permit application process and move on through the permitting and construction of their ADU. So at this point, what I'd like to do is move into a summary of the report that you were all emailed a few weeks ago and I believe received a hard copy of this morning.

Under the pilot ordinance, Department of Housing, Department of Planning were asked to review the impacts of the pilot ordinance at the three-year point and report back to Council. And so that report is our compliance with that expectation that you all asked of us. And I'd like to summarize some of those details here today.

So the Department of Housing across all five pilot areas received 729 intake applications between May 1st, 2021, which was the first date that the pilot program was open, through April 17th of this year, which is when we pulled down data to do this analysis. Of those 729, we have issued preapprovals for 553 applications. Of those 553, 215 have made it, have not only applied for permits, but received building permits for their ADUs.

It's worth noting that because these are small enough permits, there is no certificate of occupancy issued. So the last status that we have from our colleagues at the Department of Buildings is whether or not a permit has been inspected upon, which is our indication that construction is underway and leads us to conclude that that construction presumably completed accordingly. So we have 215 of those permits for a total of 250 ADUs.

The difference between those numbers is the number of sites that have asked to build more than one conversion unit, right? That margin, that difference of the sites that have asked to build more than one conversion unit, those are the units that must comply with the additional affordability requirements of the ordinance. And so that delta has led to the development of 26 mandated ACUs, affordable conversion units, under the ordinance.

Those are the ones that DOH monitors for ongoing compliance for that 60% AMI threshold. The next few slides have a few charts that report on data that is also described in the report in front of you. This slide talks to where ADU permit applications have been issued and inspected across the five pilot areas.

As you can see, the majority of ADU applications have been in the north and northwest pilot areas. In the Department of Housing's analysis, our estimation is that the smaller number of applications coming from the south, southeast, and west pilot areas are coming likely from a handful of different reasons. One is just the difference in market conditions that may lead to a different demand for ADUs, and so a different calculus for owners who may be interested in building them.

One is inequities in access to capital. We have heard, and you will hear from me and from our subject matter experts a little bit later on, that ADUs are not inexpensive to build. And so that access to capital is going to have a meaningful impact on where we're seeing them.

And then finally, the south, southeast, and west pilot areas are those areas with those additional requirements that Patrick was mentioning. And so that may be putting some downward pressure on ADU development as well. Not pictured on this slide, I do want to mention, because one of those requirements in those three wards is about owner occupancy, 46% of all approvals that DOH has issued and 27% of permits that have been issued by DOB are for buildings that are owner occupied.

And that's across all five areas, even in the north and northwest areas where that owner occupancy requirement does not exist. On this slide, you can see we're still looking at differences across the five pilot areas, but here we're looking at whether ADUs have been permitted in what types of baseline dwelling units or what types of zoning, not zoning lots, but what types of primary buildings exist on those lots. And so what you will see is that the majority of ADUs have been created on properties that include existing two to six unit buildings.

There's a majority of ADUs that have been built on coach houses, coach houses, or conversion units that are built on single family lots or on lots that have multifamily buildings with seven units or greater. Not pictured on this slide is the distinction between coach houses and conversion units that have been built. There have been 59 coach houses that have been permitted overall through the program.

That's a minority in comparison with conversion units. And again, a conversion unit is that unit that is built within the bounds of an existing building. So typically going to be an attic unit or a basement unit.

What this data shows us is that the substantial majority of ADU development is occurring in one of a few primary typologies. The most common ADU typology that we're seeing is a conversion unit in a single conversion unit being built in a middle density neighborhood with a predominance of two to six unit buildings already in that neighborhood. Other common typologies are coach houses on parcels with single family buildings and coach houses on parcels with two to six unit buildings.

Returning to the distinction between an ADU that is not income restricted and an ADU that is income restricted under the terms of the ordinance, what we've seen is that even though 85% of ADUs have been permitted in multi-unit buildings, the vast majority of building owners elect to only build a single ADU regardless of whether that's a conversion unit or a coach house. And what that means is that those single units do not have any associated affordability requirement. About just over 20 building owners have built multiple ADUs.

Only one or two have sought to build more than two. And so the vast majority of the 26 affordable units that we see spread across the northwest and south zones, those are ACUs of affordable conversion units that are built in a four to however many number of unit building that is seeking authority to build two conversion units. The last slide for me today, I just want to summarize some of the outcomes that we've seen based on our research, both of what has occurred over the last three years here in the city, as well as data that we've reviewed from cities around the country.

The high level takeaway is that what we've seen is a consistent, but not an overwhelming demand for ADUs. We don't see ADUs as a panacea to our housing shortage, but we do see it as a critical part of that mix. What we're seeing is a very gentle increase in density across neighborhoods that are impacted, one or two units here or there.

The highest demand is coming for ADUs in those north and northwest pilot zones for the reasons that I mentioned earlier. And we're seeing a and those reasons are issues of substantial concern and interest for the Department of Housing and issues we hope to continue to work on in the coming years in terms of equity of access to capital across the city in order to take on projects like this. And then a review of those key typologies I just mentioned, the addition of a single garden or attic unit in two to six unit buildings, that is the single biggest making up about half of all of the conversion or all of the ADU permits that we've seen.

And then other key typologies are coach houses in single family and two to six unit buildings. What we've seen is that we see six primary benefits of ADU development. We see the addition of housing to neighborhoods all across the city of a wide variety of densities and contexts without changing the underlying context of that neighborhood or block.

We see ADUs producing affordable housing, even though they are not subsidized, which free up Department of Housing resources to pursue other types of affordable housing work. We see, excuse me, we see ADUs creating an additional source of income for homeowners supporting homeownership across the spectrum. We also see ADUs creating an income stream for owners of two to six unit buildings.

Two to six unit buildings are our most critical source of naturally occurring affordable housing in the city and also the category of housing that we're losing the most of. And so any ADU built in a two to six unit building is helping the owner of that building preserve that building in its current use, which is a very important benefit. Finally, as you heard from a of this meeting, ADUs can provide very important opportunities for intergenerational living, aging in place and accessibility.

And then finally, something we haven't spoken about much today is that the re-permitting of ADUs through this process allows us to legalize existing ADUs that may have been built illegally. We estimate that there are thousands of illegal ADUs across the city. And if we can bring them into the fold, that is very significant in terms of our ability to protect those homeowners and tenants in the events of future conflict.

With that, I will turn it back over to Patrick.

[Speaker 3] (2:34:26 - 2:43:15)
All right. Thank you. So the next couple of slides, I will just run through some of the proposed changes as they pertain to the zoning regulations.

And all of these bullet points, all of these items have kind of worked as we expected in the sense that when the pilot was created, it was started with a smaller zoning designation or a smaller group of zoning designations, as well as restrictions that we worked through on various models, knowing that through the course of implementation, there may be some changes that we would need to propose. We've already been back here once to propose, and it was approved by council to allow for interior stairs, accessing the coach house. So stairs from a first floor of a garage, accessing a coach house to be excluded from the 700 square feet.

So as to not unnecessarily eat up square footage that could otherwise be used for living spaces. These items on the screen here and on the next slide also depict issues that we've been faced with as far as how to address both zoning district standpoint, as well as some other elements about the actual layout of the units. So starting from the top, this proposal, like we were saying before, eliminates the five pilot zones.

So it allows for the establishment of ADUs, both coach houses and conversion units, anywhere in the city pursuant to the ultimate decision by council regarding the zoning districts that will be eligible for such ADUs. The ordinance as it sits in front of you that Alderman Lawson introduced has, it's in the substitute column, has as a special use requirement ADUs within RS1 and RS2s. The expansion of the permitted ability for ADUs in this case extends to the B and C districts of which we've seen many projects come in that applicants are pursuing or interested in establishing an ADU.

However, because they have business or commercial zoning, they weren't able to take advantage of the pilot's rules, even if they were in the proper geography. So this helps lift some of those restrictions because the solution to some of those situations was to establish residential zoning along some of our primary arterials, which is not always conducive to how we would want to see the zoning used in certain neighborhoods. And then moving further down the chart, the C3 districts do not allow residential use today, so those would still remain prohibited from a residential ADU standpoint.

Obviously, manufacturing, planned manufacturing and transportation districts would remain excluded. And then the D for downtown would maintain the exclusion of the ADUs in the downtown area. There are two factors that wade into the downtown portion, one being that the minimum lot area standards that exist in downtown zoning district, downtown zoning districts is far more permissive than you find in a lot of neighborhood zoning districts, nearly all neighborhood zoning districts.

And secondarily, there are significantly less properties that are improved with single family home and lower density buildings that would even have the physical space to take advantage of the establishment of a coach house. So looking at the last column on this chart in line with the administration's efforts towards cut the tape proposals, one possible alternative for council to consider is establishing as a permitted use in the RS1 and RS2s, the establishment of coach houses or conversion units, depending on the situation. Moving down to the last two bullet points, the original ordinance contained notice requirements that are consistent with all administrative adjustments in that adjacent property owners, so the adjacent neighbors, as well as the local aldermanic office have to be notified of the proposal.

Unlike other administrative adjustments, the applicants were required to adhere to the municipal code requirements related to, in most cases, it was conversion unit, I'm sorry, coach houses, but in many cases, conversion units. And there was the fact that they were even able to be issued a permit meant that they had met all of the requirements. So there was not an evaluation that we were eligible to perform on whether a particular property that otherwise met the criteria should be denied a conversion unit.

So therefore, it was creating for many of your wards, a lot of unnecessary angst and discontent amongst neighbors in that people were notified of ADUs, but the city was not in a position to prohibit it from proceeding provided they met all of the regulation requirements from an ordinance standpoint. So moving forward, we're proposing in this ordinance to only have the notice still continue going to the aldermanic offices, but not the adjacent neighbors. Last thing on this sheet is the prohibition on both unit types being eligible for a zoning lot in the current ordinance.

Like I was saying before, that's prohibited under this ordinance that would be allowed. And then specific to conversion units or coach houses, I'll go through the first bullet point slowly because it might sound kind of confusing. In B-2 zoning districts, you can have residential uses, you can have a residential unit below the second floor.

So you could have a duplex down into a basement, you could have a ground floor residential unit. You do not have to have commercial on the first floor. However, acknowledging that many of our other zoning districts can have problems maintaining occupancy from a commercial standpoint, if you're in another zoning district besides B-2, then the ordinance is written today that the conversion unit can go on the ground floor provided that 40% of the front portion of the property is occupied with a commercial use.

So when folks come in for a permit, they have to declare a front property. We would make this calculation based on where that declaration is and the floor plan as it moves back through the lot. For coach houses, there are a couple of additional items, all of which have come up at various points in reviewing coach houses beyond the staircase issue that we talked about before.

First of all, we've had a handful of coach houses that have come in and want to provide ADA accessibility on the ground floor. And given the current structure of the ordinance where parking that exists must be maintained, that precluded some of those from actually coming to fruition. In certain cases, there were ways that they could work around based on the size of a lot or the location of the accessory building.

But in most cases, that was prohibited. This ordinance would allow through an administrative adjustment, the elimination of accessory parking so that a coach house could be established at grade in the rear of the lot. Another issue that came up is we worked very hard under the previous ordinance or the current ordinance to maintain lines of sight and open space in the rear of property.

So right now under the zoning code, there are restrictions based on your lot size and your zoning district in regards to open space and setbacks and the location of accessory buildings in comparison to the location of your principal building. At the time of the original ordinance, we had a strict requirement that a 15-foot separation be maintained. And there was no provision under that ordinance to allow for deviation.

This ordinance would allow for a reduction of that to 10 feet based on our discussions with the Department of Buildings and the Fire Department provided they are comfortable with the proposal only on lots that are of a substandard depth. So less than 125 feet. The idea behind this is we did not want to preclude someone who has the unfortunate situation of having a lot that is less than a standard depth from being able to establish a coach house within reason and within consultation with the Department of Buildings and the Fire Department.

We maintained and expanded throughout the ordinance the requirement that the principal building be established on the zoning lot prior to the coach house. And we've eliminated the 700 square foot cap on a coach house. So this last bullet point would mostly come into play if someone has an inordinately oversized yard, oversized lot, so that their 60% threshold could result in a greater than 700 square foot coach house.

So provided open space setbacks and other mathematical limitations are met, the 700 square foot would not be an artificial cap. And then the following slides are just a refresh of typical layouts for coach houses and conversion units. All of this information remains the same from four years ago.

The idea just being able to show generally where these units could be located, how they could be situated, with or without parking, given the size compared to the principal building and things of that nature. Vice Chairman, that concludes our presentation.

[Speaker 8] (2:43:17 - 2:43:17)
Great.

[Speaker 3] (2:43:18 - 2:43:19)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 2] (2:43:19 - 2:43:26)
We have a series of witnesses and then we'll do questions. So we will start with Swasti Shah from the Urban Land Institute.

[Speaker 22] (2:43:28 - 2:45:52)
Thank you. Good morning. Good afternoon, actually.

I'm Swasti Shah and I'm speaking on behalf of the Urban Land Institute of Chicago. Thank you for having me here today. And since 2020, when the Housing and Zoning Committees were first discussing the pilot ordinance, UNR Chicago has supported legalizing ADUs.

And our support is based on findings from a year-long initiative where we studied ADU best practices across the country and convened over 50 local industry and community members, including many city representatives, to assess opportunities and challenges for legalizing ADUs here in Chicago. After many intense working sessions, our initiative participants expressed overwhelming support for ADUs. Our findings are documented in a publicly available report on our website.

Please let me know if you need access to that. And today, Chicago continues to face a housing affordability crisis and allowing ADUs citywide can help alleviate this crisis. You've heard from Matt in our public comment session earlier, several of these, but I just want to reiterate some of the reasons why.

ADUs promote new unsubsidized housing at a lower cost than typical new construction units. And ADUs are typically more affordable to rent than regular units in the same neighborhood because they utilize non-primary spaces such as basements and backyards. ADUs can increase financial stability for homeowners by providing a rental income stream, or they can be a place for a family member, allowing intergenerational living and aging in place.

ADUs are also an environmentally sustainable choice because they utilize existing infrastructure, road, water, sewer. However, we've also seen that ADUs are not always easy to build. That's because most of the people building them are homeowners or small property owners.

And if the process is too complex or too expensive, they're not going to be able to go through with it. Therefore, in addition to allowing ADUs citywide, simplifying the process, providing adequate staffing to support applicants, and bolstering technical and financial assistance, especially for lower income and middle income homeowners, is key to a successful equitable ADU program. Thank you.

[Speaker 2] (2:45:53 - 2:46:02)
Thank you, Ms. Shah. And we're going to send the report from ULI to our committee members. And thank you for being involved on this and ETOD.

Next up is Enrique Castillo from CMAP.

[Speaker 25] (2:46:03 - 2:48:13)
Hello, good afternoon. Thank you for having us here today. Again, my name is Enrique Castillo.

I'm a senior planner at the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning. As the federally designated transportation office and state charter planning organization for northeastern Illinois, the comments shared reflect CMAP's regional activities across 284 municipalities, seven counties that we serve, including the city of Chicago and its 77 community areas. With outcomes of achieving a greater diversity of housing choices and access to transportation and economic opportunity, we have partnered with agencies such as the Mayor's Metropolitan Caucus, the Illinois Housing Development Authority, and AARP, seven municipalities to deliver technical assistance to support advancing housing development, including our policy brief and toolkit for the expansion of ADUs through municipal building and zoning code reform. CMAP has seen the value of exploring strategies and increasing the accessibility and affordability of housing, including the expansion of ADUs.

Our Onto 2050 Regional Comprehensive Plan calls for the creation of more housing options. Municipalities are motivated to approve ADUs because they are convenient and affordable housing options that can maintain neighborhood character, provide housing opportunities for older adults, empty nesters, and young adults who want to live close to family members. ADUs help meet the growing demand for housing, increase access to job and services, promotes compact development, and supports multi-generational living.

In addition to supporting transit, we are here to make a statement that the expansion of Chicago's ADUs policy is a positive advancement, yet as the regional agency, we attest that there is no one-size-fits-all solution for the municipalities. We strongly support and advocate for public conversations such as this one to ensure that ADU policies are appropriate for the city, and we appreciate the opportunity to contribute to the discourse. Thank you.

[Speaker 2] (2:48:14 - 2:48:17)
Thank you, Mr. Castillo. From AARP, we have Samar Jha.

[Speaker 15] (2:48:19 - 2:48:34)
Hello, everyone. Can you hear me? Yes, proceed.

Perfect. Good afternoon, Chairperson Lawson and members of the Committee on Zoning, Landmark, and Building Standards. My name is Samar Jha, Government Affairs Director.

One second, Mr. Jha. One second. We've got some feedback.

[Speaker 2] (2:48:48 - 2:48:49)
All right.

[Speaker 15] (2:48:49 - 2:51:59)
Mr. Jha, can you go ahead and try again? Yeah. Can you hear me again, or there's any...

Yeah. Speak up, but proceed. All right.

Good afternoon. I'll start again. My name is Samar Jha.

I'm from AARP's Government Affairs team. I'm here today on behalf of AARP Illinois and its 250,000 members in the city of Chicago. AARP welcomes this opportunity to address the urgent housing needs of the city of Chicago's older adults and to discuss solutions to address them.

The current state of housing is precarious for too many older adults, and their families in the city is threatening the quality of life. As the older adult population grows in the years ahead, concrete steps are needed at all levels and throughout society to prepare to meet the housing needs of older adults. According to AARP's 2021 Home and Community Preference Survey, more than 75% of people age 50 plus want to age in place.

To address the concerns, AARP supports passage of ADU regulations that will increase housing options for people of all ages. ADUs provide separate living and independent quarters, and because they tend to be smaller, they can be good housing options for older adults who want to downsize but still live in a neighborhood setting. You may have heard ADUs referred to with other terms such as accessory apartments, garage apartments, etc.

And one of the most famous persons to have ever lived in an ADU was Farns from Happy Days, who lived in a garage apartment. So it's not a new concept, it's been there for a long time, and it's just that we are starting the conversation again. According to the previous survey, as I had mentioned, 60% of older adults indicated that they're willing to consider options like ADUs to live near someone but maintain their own space, save money, and also get help with daily activities.

ADUs are particularly suited for older homeowners as they allow a separate unit inside or outside the home which can be used for family nearby to house a caregiver or to supplement fixed income. AARP across the country now advocates for adoption of more flexible land use policies to allow homeowners to construct ADUs if they choose to. Older adults in the city of Chicago want to stay in their homes and community as they age while also providing accessible housing designated to fit their needs, including supportive services that may enable them to live with dignity and independence in their own homes and stay connected to their communities.

While allowing ADUs to be built citywide is not the only solution to solve the housing crisis, however, we believe ADUs can ease the housing supply crisis, create more affordable housing options, and allow older adults to stay in community as they belong to. In closing, I would like to thank the committee for the chance to testify and we look forward to collaborating to work on legislative solutions to help the city of Chicago to ease the housing crisis and we also would like to thank Mayor Johnson, Chairperson Lawson, co-sponsors of the ordinance, and the city's Department of Housing and Department of Planning and Development for leading the effort to streamline and simplify the regulations on ADUs.

My colleague Adam Ballard, who's also online, and me are up here to answer your questions. Thank you so much.

[Speaker 2] (2:52:00 - 2:52:12)
Thank you, Mr. John. Thank you for channeling the Fonz from Happy Days, who lives in a coach house. Up next, Miguel Chacon, who's an agent with Real Estate, a real estate agent with Compass and the Neighborhood Building Owners Alliance.

[Speaker 28] (2:52:13 - 2:54:15)
Thank you, Alderman Lawson. Yes, I'm a local housing provider. I'm here to express my in favor of being of the expanding the ADU ordinance.

I really wanted to speak about who is the one that would benefit the most. As a broker, I've seen thousands of buildings. I've been planning of guard departments and coach houses in every community and at every price point, and whether we acknowledge it or not, these kinds of units already exist and are integral part of every community across Chicago.

We often aren't even aware that they're part of our community and behind that long gangway or there's a coach house, there's a guard department door, and these are the people that are working in our schools. They pay taxes and perhaps we're saving to buy a home. There are people that are often in the background that they nonetheless deserve homes that are up to code with proper exits, proper ventilation, and most importantly, a safe environment.

This is what ADU can really accomplish in providing homes for them. As a property owner, garden level or coach house units generally rent for about 15 percent less than those that are above grade, and these apartments are the very definition of naturally occurring affordable housing. It's important to note that ADUs cost city taxpayers absolutely nothing since most do not receive any city, state, or federal subsidies, and for context, of the 28 units of affordable units that have been built through the ADU pilot program, that would have collectively cost the city of Chicago 15 million dollars at the average cost of construction for one unit of affordable housing.

As a realtor, I've sat across many kitchen tables with elderly clients who discuss the challenges of paying their ever-increasing property taxes and their medical expenses, and yet they have a full basement they can't use to generate supplemental income. I've sold homes to young couples who purchase a single family property with five bedrooms, four baths, three levels, two kitchens, and sometimes only one child, but they aren't legally allowed to rent out their garden level apartment to save for their kids' college fund or to provide for an in-law suite for their aging parents. ADUs are not going to solve all our problems, but for many renters and for property owners alike, it's a lifeline they need to stay in their homes, to stay in their communities, and in some cases to stay in our city.

I do urge everyone to pass this ordinance and provide equitable access to safe, naturally occurring, affordable housing in the entire city of Chicago.

[Speaker 2] (2:54:16 - 2:54:20)
Thank you, Mr. Chacon. Next is Steven Vance from the Urban Environmentalists.

[Speaker 16] (2:54:22 - 2:57:40)
Hello, my name is Steven Vance. I'm an urban planner and consultant in Chicago, and I'm also a member of Urban Environmentalists Illinois. So I've been studying, promoting, and collaborating with city officials and others around ADUs for six years in Chicago.

I was also on ULI Chicago's task force, have presented to various groups about how to build an ADU, and created a free directory on Chicago Cityscape that lists local architects and companies who can design and build ADUs, several of which gave a comment earlier today. Given that background of some of my ADU work, I feel that I understand a lot of how the adoption of ADUs in the last three years has fared and can point out future benefits that the city will gain if the proposed ordinance is adopted, and I will highlight some of those benefits. Removing the maximum coach house size that Patrick Murphy described.

So allowing larger coach houses on larger size properties will allow more family size units with two or more bedrooms. It can also be more cost effective to build because coach houses have high fixed costs, and that the proposed ordinance could facilitate more family size coach houses that are currently being built. Another change would be allowing ground level coach houses through the administrative adjustment for a parking reduction.

So that would mean that you could build a coach house at grade, which would make it or could make it accessible. This would make it easier for families to decide to build a small house for an aging family member who may very well be the current owner, as well as put a dent in the dearth of accessible housing in the city. A secondary benefit of this change is that ground level construction is significantly cheaper than building a top of garage.

A third benefit is allowing all residential buildings in non-residential zones to participate. So the proposed ordinance would allow thousands of residential only buildings that are currently in B or C zoning districts to add an ADU. The Institute for Housing Studies at DePaul University found that 25% of buildings with five or more units fit into this category but are currently ineligible.

These are the building sizes that are most capable of adding two or more ADUs. And we heard earlier that if two or more ADUs are built, then every other one must be rented at an affordable rate. A fourth benefit is allowing coach houses and conversion units on the same lot can also be cost effective for the property owner.

This is because building either the conversion unit or the coach house often requires a water service upgrade or an electrical service upgrade. And having to do that for both units would make it serving both units would make it more cost effective because now you're getting two units fixed costs instead of just one unit for that same amount of upgrade cost. But I believe that the biggest gains in ADU policy will come from allowing them citywide in all residential and mixed use zoning districts.

Citywide expansion makes it simpler for the departments to administer, makes all buildings that are capable of adding an ADU become eligible to add an ADU, makes it easier for homeowners to add an additional home to fit their changing household needs, which I think Miguel covered quite well, and lets other property owners add to the city's housing abundance, thereby slowing down rent increases that the city is currently experiencing.

[Speaker 34] (2:57:41 - 2:57:41)
Thank you.

[Speaker 2] (2:57:42 - 2:57:46)
Thank you, Mr. Vance. And our final witness is Maggie Cassidy with the Preservation Compact.

[Speaker 34] (2:57:47 - 2:59:25)
Good afternoon. I am Maggie Cassidy, Director of the Preservation Compact. The Compact is a policy collaborative bringing together government agencies, advocates, and non-profit and for-profit housing developers and operators to preserve affordable rental housing.

We focus on both subsidized government-assisted housing and, pertinent to today's conversation, unsubsidized naturally occurring affordable housing. The Compact is housed at Community Investment Corporation, or CIC. CIC is a non-profit mission-driven lender that improves and preserves rental housing throughout the Chicago region.

CIC clients are small businesses and local owner-operators of quality, affordable rental housing. I am pleased to be here today to speak in support of the expansion of the city's ADU pilot program. Even before recent policy changes, the Chicago region has long had an existing stock of ADUs, primarily garden units but also coach houses.

These existing ADUs tend to be naturally more affordable than other types of units. In our current climate of rapidly increasing operating costs for housing providers, a new or newly legalized ADU increases the resiliency of the small to medium-sized owner-operators that CIC serves, making operations more sustainable while also providing more affordable options for tenants. We believe encouraging the legalization of existing non-conforming units and the construction of new ADUs, particularly the conversion units, can help add to the naturally occurring affordable housing stock in our city.

Thank you.

[Speaker 2] (2:59:33 - 2:59:41)
All right, thank you, Ms. Cassidy. Grant, did you want to add anything? We're good?

Okay, we're going to move on to questions then. I know, Alderman Dowell?

[Speaker 5] (2:59:48 - 3:02:32)
I'm not sure how I feel about the ADU, you know, the expansion. You know, I saw in the presentation it often produces affordable housing without subsidy, and I would say rarely based on the numbers that we were presented with today. So I would like to have hear more discussion about how we use this tool to really increase affordable housing opportunities in the city.

I don't feel that this ordinance does that. That's one thing. You also mentioned that people can get subsidies from CHA or the Chicago Low-Income Housing Trust or Chicago Rents, and I'm wondering if you have any data that tells us how many people actually sought subsidies from these entities.

I would like to get some more information on how affordability is enforced. I think you mentioned that your staff does that, but I don't really have a sense of how that happens. And has the team given any thought to how we might incentivize the creation of ADUs in the south and west sides of the city where the numbers have been, as we've been presented with today, they're very, very low.

What can be done to do that? I guess the things that I like, I like the fact that coach houses cannot be established on lots without a principal residential structure. I like that.

And I'm wondering if you could speak to the minor tweaks to procedural requirements to ensure compliance for conversion units. Of the 102 units on the north side and the 103 units on the northwest side, where are these 26 affordable units? I have a lot of questions.

[Speaker 2] (3:02:32 - 3:02:39)
We'll stop there. I think Matt Stern from housing is going to take most of them and Patrick will likely go.

[Speaker 1] (3:02:41 - 3:08:23)
Yes, thank you Alderman. I appreciate those excellent questions. I've jotted down five.

I'll try to answer those five. And if I missed anything, feel free to correct me. The first question was about subsidy.

We absolutely want to do more work to pair ADU builders and owners with ongoing rental subsidy programs. We don't have that data today. The compliance for someone who is not required to rent their ADU at an affordable rate, our last point of contact with them is getting the verification that they have applied for permits and have those permits inspected.

Because there is no ongoing compliance action for us to take, we actually don't currently have any details about whether they are using that unit for a family member or whether they're renting it. And if they're renting it, by what means? We do at the Department of Housing relatively recently have a staff position that is 50% focused on ADUs.

And one of the things that we're very hopeful for is that we can harness that additional staff capacity to really work on learning more about the different use cases for ADUs around the city, as well as to do the incentivization work and the promotion of ADUs in neighborhoods where we're seeing less uptake. How do we enforce? So for the 26 affordable units, mandated affordable units that we currently have, the process as laid out in ordinance is that the Department of Housing notifies that applicant, okay, you've requested two or more units.

That means you are obligated to keep a number of units affordable, maybe one, maybe more if they're building more than three conversion units in their building. And then we will work with them on approving a legal notice that they then have to record against their deed and then send proof of that recordation to us for our tracking. And so that legal notice runs with the land.

And so even if that homeowner or building owner sells, a future owner would still be obligated to comply with that. And then we have an annual compliance process in which owners complete affidavits, verifying that they are complying with that notice that is legally recorded against their property. In terms of incentivization, we absolutely agree that the disparity and where ADU development has happened in the pilots is something that we all need to work on.

There has been some good turns of events at a national level in terms of rules coming from federal lenders that will target middle and lower income homeowners to allow them for the first time to calculate in their loan to cost calculations to use the expected future rent of an ADU as a income stream for proving out that they are eligible to receive a rehab loan that could actually fund the ADU. So that's one example of, hopefully, it's a relatively new rule, and hopefully we'll see some benefit to moderate income and lower income homeowners through that program. And the other thing, of course, is do we as a city want to create a grant type opportunity in which we are supporting directly lower and moderate income homeowners to build ADUs?

And the ordinance in front of you today is a zoning ordinance. It does not imagine a grant program, but that's definitely something that we'd be interested in talking to you and this body about in the future. Minor tweaks from a reporting perspective.

So at the top of this meeting, when Patrick mentioned that there are some changes to 2-44-106 as well as Title 17, those are the changes that we're talking about when we talk about those minor changes. And so we are doing some things that are as small as allowing our construction and compliance team to set the annual date at which we receive those annual compliance affidavits. It just so happens that the ordinance specified January 15th, which is a very bad month for that division based on all of the other work that they do.

It wasn't a big deal when there were only 26 of them, but in a citywide expansion, when we hope that that compliance mandate grows, we want to give the commissioner the authority to determine annually what time of year those affidavits are collected. So it's changes like that. There's even one or two typos that we're correcting in this section of the code, as well as clarifying some of the reporting expectations and giving us some flexibility on how we handle the aldermanic reporting section.

And so we're hoping in the near term to create an automatic tool where you are notified electronically through a portal system of an ADU request in your award. And so it's creating the flexibility for those kinds of future systems to be put in place. Yes.

[Speaker 5] (3:08:23 - 3:09:30)
I was going to just thank you for the complexity of your answers. I appreciate that. And I would recommend that we look at, Chairman, a companion to the ordinance that helps to incentivize ADUs in the west and the south sides of the city.

And that if you're asking me to vote on this to support something like this citywide, I would like to see some consideration given to helping those people who might, for example, a parent dies and the children take over, but while they could be helpful, they may have some means to move it to create an ADU unit or build a coach house or convert a building. They need some assistance. So thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 2] (3:09:31 - 3:09:57)
Thank you, Alderman Dowell. I think you're going to see a couple of companion ordinances both by incentives and tweaking the affordability. Having that discussion so we get more affordable units, subsidized units as well.

So stay tuned. I know Alderman, Vice Mayor Burnett, did you have, I'm sorry, Patrick, do you want to add? Okay.

Sure. Yes.

[Speaker 1] (3:09:57 - 3:10:40)
Yeah. No, Patrick made an excellent point, which is that one of the things that is already changing in this current ordinance in front of you is the removal of the current requirement that ADUs are only built on owner-occupied homes in one to three unit baseline homes. And so that's a restriction that was placed during the pilot due to some concerns at the time.

But we think that actually lifting that may in fact help and be one of the that could promote additional ADU development in the three pilots that we didn't see very much during the last three years.

[Speaker 2] (3:10:41 - 3:10:43)
Thank you. Vice Mayor Burnett.

[Speaker 8] (3:10:43 - 3:11:03)
Thank you. So a couple of questions. One, I saw where you had seven floors from seven floors plus.

Seven units. Seven units plus. That's seven floors, right?

Thank you. So now that's a change, right? Is that a change?

[Speaker 1] (3:11:04 - 3:11:04)
No.

[Speaker 8] (3:11:04 - 3:11:12)
It's always been units plus? So if you have seven units plus, that means you can do something in your basement or you can do a coach house or both?

[Speaker 1] (3:11:14 - 3:11:34)
Any building that otherwise qualifies can build one or more conversion units. So at present, a one to four unit building is eligible for a single conversion unit, five to seven for two, eight to 11 for three. I think I'm getting that math right.

[Speaker 8] (3:11:34 - 3:11:40)
So when you say conversion units, they'll take one of their apartments and say this is an ADU apartment now?

[Speaker 1] (3:11:40 - 3:12:00)
No, sorry. A conversion unit, it is a somewhat confusing term. It is the conversion of existing unutilized space in the building into an additional dwelling unit.

And so that is typically a garden or basement or potentially an attic unit. It's the addition of a unit. It is not the conversion of an existing unit.

[Speaker 8] (3:12:00 - 3:12:07)
So they can have a basement and they can have an attic. And now we're saying that they can do the first floor too?

[Speaker 1] (3:12:08 - 3:12:40)
The first floor, in residential districts, the conversion unit rules are agnostic to where the unit gets placed. Theoretically, if a building had unused first floor space in a residential zone, that could be converted into a conversion unit. That's not likely, but it is possible.

The change that Patrick was talking about is specifically for certain BNC districts that don't currently allow residential on their storefront.

[Speaker 8] (3:12:40 - 3:13:00)
Right. So most in BNC districts, there's not residential on the first floor. So now you're saying we can have residential on the first floor, but in the back, right?

In the back. And so now we're not required. So they get relief from the parking requirements?

[Speaker 3] (3:13:03 - 3:13:31)
Parking requirements or relief from the parking requirements, yes. But that particular passage essentially just relieves those applicants from having to seek a special use for putting a residential use below the second floor. So we won't have to do the special use?

Correct. The big benefit is it eliminates a special use, but it doesn't completely cannibalize commercial ability on the ground floor. So that's why there's a 40%.

If you have commercial in the front- If you put commercial in the front, you can avoid the special use for the rear.

[Speaker 8] (3:13:31 - 3:13:35)
So you can live in the back and have your office up front.

[Speaker 3] (3:13:36 - 3:13:37)
And that's on the first- They're separated, yes.

[Speaker 8] (3:13:38 - 3:13:42)
I've had a few buildings like that built, actually. Yeah, but that's on the first floor.

[Speaker 3] (3:13:42 - 3:13:43)
Yes, sir.

[Speaker 8] (3:13:43 - 3:14:15)
Correct. So also, so I saw the different... So I was one of the pilots and I appreciate it, but I saw the different buildings that you had built.

I didn't see any coach houses. Are coach houses included? Yes.

Because coach houses have... And you know, coach houses... And I heard you talking about the square footage.

Coach houses generally are like 20 feet wide, right?

[Speaker 3] (3:14:16 - 3:14:33)
Right. So, okay. So this shows just a typical block of where they could be positioned.

But coach houses are included in the ADUs. So they're in the ordinance, but they're excluded from the affordability requirement because the cost to build the coach house would lend them not being- I'm sorry.

[Speaker 8] (3:14:33 - 3:14:44)
I said coach house. I meant townhouses. Townhouses are generally 20 feet wide, right?

They don't have a side yard, right?

[Speaker 3] (3:14:45 - 3:15:44)
Well, they do have side yards, but they typically would not have the depth of open space specific to one unit. So a townhouse development is, in many cases, either going to have a significantly sized detached garage, or it's going to have individual parking on the ground floor of whatever the individual units are. So in theory, you wouldn't be prohibited from doing a coach house or conversion unit, but it's unlikely, I guess, unless in the situation where you have underutilized space or there are units within the townhouse development that were not fully built out for residential purposes.

So I wouldn't say it's impossible, but it's probably very unlikely. And I can't think of a permit that's come through into a townhouse development. Grant, can you think?

I can't think of one. No. So no.

[Speaker 8] (3:15:45 - 3:15:54)
So there haven't been anything- I can't. We cannot think of one collectively. Right.

Because I don't know where they're allowed. You said they are allowed? Well, they wouldn't be prohibited.

[Speaker 3] (3:15:54 - 3:16:20)
It's just finding the space within the townhouse development to put a conversion unit, or finding- Or put a coach house. Right. Or finding an ability to put a coach house within whatever the parking structure is for a townhouse.

It's probably not very conducive to putting in an ADU. Why? Because they don't have enough space?

Well, they probably don't have enough unused space.

[Speaker 8] (3:16:20 - 3:16:30)
There are probably- What if they built a building there to build a coach house?

[Speaker 3] (3:16:30 - 3:16:49)
Okay. So I guess if a townhouse had a standalone independent garage, it's possible they could find a path to eliminate that parking, build a coach house in its place. The only caveat I would add to that is I don't know what type of restrictions might exist in a private townhouse association that may preclude them from doing that anyway.

[Speaker 8] (3:16:49 - 3:16:59)
So what about, and I'm asking all of this because I thought in the past there was some concerns about fire stuff.

[Speaker 3] (3:17:00 - 3:17:52)
Okay. So one of the things we did not change that I was alluding to with the Department of Buildings earlier and the fire department is the size of the coach house itself. So the 22 feet in height and the location when it's in the middle of a block.

So if it's not abutting an alley, we specifically included, and I believe there's going to be a depiction, well, it might be hard to see, but we specifically included a requirement that a passageway be kept on the side of the coach house, interior to the block, three feet wide, no obstructions, so that there can be access to the second floor in case of an emergency. That is still remaining. So right, they couldn't be abutting each other consecutively down a block.

That would still, that may be one of the preclusions for a townhouse parking structure to actually establish a coach house in lieu of some of those parking spaces.

[Speaker 8] (3:17:56 - 3:19:23)
Okay. So I think this is great that we're expanding this. This will help to get more affordable housing.

I recognize what, and I appreciate all of the experts coming down and testify. I understand what Alderman Dow was speaking of is concerned about in some of the communities, they can't afford to build the coach house, right? And then may have challenges converting their basements or attics into ADUs without some type of financial assistance.

So that'll come down the line dealing with housing and we can be creative with that in the future. But I think this is great. I think this will help to get more affordability in our communities and seeing as though we're moving more away from more parking in communities and more residents in communities.

I think this will help us to be competitive with building our population in the city of Chicago. So now if someone wanted to, so someone can just come with a brand new development and they can come with a brand new development and they can have more living spaces on that vacant land. Now they can come and say, I'm going to build a seven unit building.

I'm going to build a coach house too.

[Speaker 3] (3:19:23 - 3:20:03)
Right. So they could do that. So originally they could do the coach house at the time of original construction, but you could never, and you still can't under this proposal, provide conversion units until the physical structure, the principal building is at least 20 years old.

The idea being we had, there are certain restrictions related to density. We're not looking to create a workaround for additional units to be provided above and beyond the zoning code. We were looking for an ability to seamlessly reuse underutilized space.

So it would, conversion units were not intended to apply to new construction coach house though, with no problem. All right. Okay.

Thank you. Great. Thank you, vice mayor.

Alderman Spada.

[Speaker 4] (3:20:03 - 3:22:27)
Thank you very much, chair. Really excited for this presentation. There's no small part of me that wishes we were having this conversation a year ago, in part because this really has been in many ways an unmitigated success in Chicago, or at least I can speak for the first war that has had such an enthusiastic reception for ADUs.

The ADU was my first apartment, second apartment after college. I have so many friends who live in those units. Now there's a nun hoping to add one in our building in the future, but it works.

And it's the first tool really, against what we could have called deconversion units over the past 10, 15 years. There was so many spaces in the first board where we've seen three flats, the opposite of this happened, hollowed out to create 4,000, 5,000 square foot, single family homes. And now to have expanding tools for adding and bringing back gentle density is just a meaningful, powerful thing.

I know we talked about the notice and those notices that we get in the ward office is just wonderful. Every time that we get a letter from a new applicant in the first board, it's very exciting for our office. I'm excited for what chairwoman Dowell talked about earlier in terms of new financing tools for expanding coach houses.

I'm excited to see the zones move forward. The only condition I wanted to ask about is if there's ways to expand the cap on the number of units being created, which is to say, as we expand this, when we look at C zoning, B zoning, potentially buildings with a larger footprint, we have had cases where folks have the choice essentially between two 1,400 square foot ADUs or four 700 square foot two bedrooms. We would love to see them do the four units, particularly where we can get two units in advance, but we've been precluded from that by the existing zoning and I would love to figure it out.

[Speaker 3] (3:22:29 - 3:23:18)
So that probably would be a discussion. So the only way to address that through the ordinance would be to alter the 33% figure in the second bullet point. So your ratio could get more intense and you could add more units.

That would be a discussion about the 33%. Secondarily, a discussion about all density throughout zoning districts, ADUs aside, would be a much larger discussion separate from this ordinance. So if you want to have a discussion about the 33%, we could certainly do that to lower that threshold to allow more units.

So that would be another item for consideration along with the other items from this slide that kind of detail some of the zoning, these two slides that detail some of the zoning text changes.

[Speaker 4] (3:23:18 - 3:23:43)
I mean, it's a relatively small quibble at the end of the day against the exceptional power of what this ordinance can bring to Chicago. So glad that we're in this, lots of people coming in. All right.

All right. You know, I'll just close by saying glad for the conversation that we're having now. I'll be even happier when we have the opportunity to vote on this matter, but thank you, Chair, for your leadership.

[Speaker 2] (3:23:43 - 3:23:54)
Thank you all. I appreciate everyone's patience as we wrap up. I think it was just one more speaker and CDC will start shortly after.

Appreciate you staying quiet. Thank you. All of it.

And teacher Lopez.

[Speaker 10] (3:23:55 - 3:25:28)
Thank you, Chairman. And I appreciate the subject matter hearing. This is an important issue and actually as good a set way for the next meeting that we have on the CDC.

As you know, with property taxes increasing so rapidly and the stagnation on the supply of homes in general citywide, but across the country, the need for an increase of affordable housing is critical. One of the obstacles, and I think I echo Alderman Dowell, is the incentives of how we can help those small homeowners who are struggling to actually make those repairs on basements and coach houses. So that is one of the main obstacles that we face so that we can legalize and ultimately utilize a truly needed supply of affordable housing through the affordable housing, which is small homeowners.

So in terms of programs that the city has in order to incentivize and help those homeowners, again, we do have our own local plan that we will propose so that we can help those small homeowners, but I wonder citywide, how can we help? And there's a fund available to incentivize those areas of the city that could benefit by this program. But again, I appreciate the zoning expedition in terms of some of the zoning obstacles, but in terms of repairs that are expensive right now, how we can do that in areas that really need the support, and we do need some help also with funds.

Thank you. Matt?

[Speaker 1] (3:25:30 - 3:26:22)
Thank you, Alderman. It's an excellent question. It's a great point.

And as I mentioned earlier, this ordinance is a zoning change ordinance. We're not talking about creating a funding program here. Budget season will be upon us sooner than any of us probably realize or want.

And if we want to have a conversation about ways that the city can do the kind of thing that you're talking about, I think the housing department would be very interested in that conversation. We believe at baseline that ADU, for all of the reasons that the subject matter experts and that Patrick and I have mentioned today, that at baseline, ADU expansion citywide, even without additional subsidy, is a good thing for housing affordability and housing choice. How do we take the next step is an excellent question.

I think it goes back to Alderman Dowell's questions as well. And it's definitely a conversation we're willing to keep talking about.

[Speaker 2] (3:26:23 - 3:26:32)
Let me ask though, are there any existing assistance programs for homeowners that could apply in an ADU situation?

[Speaker 1] (3:26:32 - 3:27:15)
So we do know that the county assessor has, one of the projects that he's been working on is adjusting assessments based on commitments to affordability. And so in the event that ADU was created, even an ADU that wasn't mandated by the housing departments to be affordable, in the event that a homeowner chose to say, I'm going to make this an affordable unit, I think there would be an interesting conversation with the assessor's office about whether that would impact property tax bills. There are certainly ongoing conversations in the housing department about policies and strategies that we might be able to create, but those are in their early stages.

[Speaker 10] (3:27:16 - 3:27:33)
Thank you, Chairman. And again, I know that we have another meeting coming up, but again, I reiterate my call to a subject matter hearing with the assessor to discuss these proposals and how we can help those small homeowners who are in need. So again, budget season coming up.

So we encourage our colleagues to think about this as well. Thank you. Thank you.

[Speaker 11] (3:27:34 - 3:27:34)
Absolutely.

[Speaker 2] (3:27:34 - 3:27:55)
Thank you Alderman Citro Lopez. I appreciate those comments. I think we have a list of a little bit more work to do after we pass this piece.

That concluding the questions from members, there being no further business before the body, Alderman Dalmos, we adjourn. All in favor, say aye. All opposed, say nay.

Continue to try the eyes of it. We are adjourned.
