[Speaker 18] (2:41 - 2:49)
Okay, all right. All right, we're going to reconvene a minute early.

[Speaker 1] (2:49 - 3:43)
I hope that doesn't offend anybody. So it's going to be middle of page eight, document number 21035 in the 25th ward. Ordinance was referred on May 23rd of 2022.

Common address is 1037 West 16th Street, 1600 through 1638 and 1746 to 1758 South Miller Street and 1018 through 1030 West 18th Street. The change request from C12 neighborhood commercial district and RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district all to an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district. We have Scott Bornstein with this board of education application.

Scott. Yep. Can you hear me?

[Speaker 12] (3:43 - 4:44)
Mr. Chairman? Great. Thank you.

Scott Bornstein from the law office of Neal and LeRoy here on behalf of the board of education. I'm joined by Evan Smith, who's the director of planning. If there's any questions about the project here, but this is really just a zoning cleanup matter.

The site has split zoning. It's got a C zone and R zone. And based on the city's rules, you can't, you know, you can't do a school in a C zone, which would be the more restrictive.

So this is just a cleanup to get it into the R4 district. There's no changes to the school. We are doing, you know, some renovation work, but this is really just a cleanup in order to be able to get our permits and not have an issue, no changes to the operations of the school or anything like that.

You should have received a letter from the alderman. I think indicating he's got no objection, but asking for the committee support. So that's all this is.

And with any questions, we turn it over back to you.

[Speaker 1] (4:45 - 5:35)
All right, Scott, we do have a letter of support from Alderman Sitio Lopez. Questions, comments from committee members? Hearing none.

Can I get a motion to move to pass? Alderman Wagesbeck makes the motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, this item is passed. Bottom of page eight, document number 21052-T1 in the 25th board ordinance was referred on June 22nd 2022. Common address is 125 South Racine Avenue and the change request from DS3 Downtown Service District to DX3 Downtown Mixed Use District.

We have Warren Silver on this application in 25.

[Speaker 4] (5:36 - 7:56)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. For the record, Warren Silver of Silver Law Office PC representing the applicants and owners Steve Golden and Cynthia Arnold Golden. Steve and Cindy are married to each other and they've lived in this building since roughly 1980.

First Steve and then Cindy moved in later. And at the beginning, Steve owned the building in common with some other artist types, including one architect that basically took control of fixing up the building. Years later, I'm talking last summer, June of 2021, one of the tenants in the building had a party that apparently got a little out of control, attracted city inspectors and the next thing you know, they were slapped with a bunch of building violations and also found out that the building had not been zoned for residential use all this time.

It had been an M zoning under the previous zoning ordinance and changed to DS3 with the 2004 comprehensive revision and they had no idea. At this point, they are looking to fix the building up, correct building violations and also to reduce the number of dwelling units there from four to two. In order to do that, we are seeking a type one rezoning, calling for the two dwelling units in this two and three story brick building.

And in accordance with the plans and narrative that were filed at the time of application, they have not changed. There is no substitute narrative or plans. At this time, I'd like to entertain any questions and we ask for your favorable consideration.

I want to add though that we did receive back in April, transmitted to the committee, a letter of no objection from Alderman Sitio Lopez. We had presented the matter to his zoning advisory committee in the 25th ward and it was well received.

[Speaker 1] (7:58 - 8:04)
Okay. All right, Warren, Alderman Sitio Lopez, you're on the call on this item on South Racine.

[Speaker 17] (8:07 - 8:31)
Thank you, chairman. And I just want to confirm, you know, we work with the applicant. I think it's been a little while, you know, we were able to resume conversations.

The applicant has been fulfilling the commitments with the zoning advisory board. And of course, we like to ask the committee for a favorable vote on this item. And thanks to the applicant for their patience as well to work with us.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (8:31 - 9:22)
Thank you, Alderman. Questions, comments for the Alderman or the applicant? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move to pass for the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

I'll move, chairman. Vice chair Roboyes makes the motion. Any objections to his motion?

Hearing none, the item is passed. All right, top of page nine, document number 21055 in the 23rd ward. Ordinance was referred on June 22nd of 2022.

Common address is 5101 South Millard Avenue. Change requests from RT4 residential two flat townhouse and multiunit district to M11 limited manufacturing business park district. We have Brendan Perry on this item.

Penny is the last name.

[Speaker 10] (9:22 - 9:24)
Okay, that's correct. Can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (9:24 - 9:26)
Yes, continue, please.

[Speaker 10] (9:26 - 10:17)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Brendan Penny of PC here representing the applicant and owner. I have here with me on the call a representative of the applicant, John Allen, to answer any questions that might be directed to the applicant.

The subject property is currently a vacant lot. We are requesting a zoning change from RT4 residential two flat townhouse and multiunit district to M1 limited manufacturing to bring it into conformity with the parcels located to the east and the south. This property will serve as an accessory parking lot and service the adjacent industrial building directly to the south.

We understand that Alderman Tavares, the older woman, I'm sorry, Tavares is in support of the project and her letter of support was previously provided to the committee for this hearing. So we are respectfully requesting support from this committee to rezone from RT4 to M11.

[Speaker 1] (10:19 - 10:30)
All right, we do have a letter of support from Alderman Tavares. And I'm assuming this parking lot is for the restaurant or what, correct?

[Speaker 10] (10:30 - 10:33)
It's a processing facility, but correct.

[Speaker 1] (10:33 - 10:45)
It's a processing facility. Okay, great. Questions, comments from committee members?

Hearing none, I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

[Speaker 5] (10:46 - 10:47)
Moved to pass, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (10:47 - 11:58)
Alderman Wagespack makes the motion. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

All right, top of page 10. Let's see, we have document number 2154-T1 in the 15th ward. Ordinance was referred on June 22nd of 2022.

Common address is 1920 through 1924 West 59th Street. And the change request from M11, Limited Manufacturing Business Park District to C11 Neighborhood Commercial District. Wendy Berry.

I guess, Ms. Berry, you're calling in? Ms. Berry, can we find your hand raised so we can find you? Yes, I'm here.

Okay, there you go. All right, would you proceed on this item on 59th Street, please?

[Speaker 13] (12:00 - 12:25)
Yes, my name is Wendy Berry, and I'm here representing Grandma Marie Learning Center asking if you could consider changing our current zoning district from an M1-1 Limited Manufacturing Business to a C1-1 Neighborhood Commercial District for the purposes of a potential daycare center.

[Speaker 1] (12:29 - 12:36)
All right, so what has been the process, Ms. Berry, in regards to reaching out to the aldermen?

[Speaker 13] (12:38 - 13:04)
So I do have a letter of support from Alderman Lopez's office. We submitted all the, I submitted plans. I met with Mr. Raymond, I believe Martinez, and some members of the zoning department, and they gave me their support, and they also sent me a letter of support.

[Speaker 1] (13:08 - 13:15)
Alderman Lopez is not on the call. Would you get that letter to the committee over here?

[Speaker 13] (13:16 - 13:17)
I can send it right now, sir.

[Speaker 1] (13:18 - 13:39)
All right. All right, so what we'll do is I'll get a motion to accept this, knowing that we're going to get that letter of support, and obviously I'm going to find Alderman Lopez to make sure, but you'll send it to the committee before the end of this meeting, correct?

[Speaker 13] (13:40 - 13:41)
I'm doing it as we speak.

[Speaker 1] (13:42 - 13:53)
Okay. All righty. All right.

Given that, given that basis, can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderman?

[Speaker 18] (13:54 - 13:55)
So moved, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (13:55 - 14:46)
Alderman Austin makes the motion. Any objections? Hearing none, this item will pass, and again, we will get both the letter of support from Alderman, the original Alderman Lopez, and then we will, I will reach out to make sure this is okay for Wednesday approval.

Thank you, Ms. Berry. All right, middle of page 10, document number 21053 in the 11th ward. Ordinance was referred on June 22nd of 2022.

Common addresses 635 through 37 West 26th Street, and the change request from RT4 residential two-plat townhouse and multi-unit district to B12 neighborhood shopping district. Sylvia Micas. Sylvia?

[Speaker 3] (14:47 - 15:14)
Good afternoon, Chairman Toney and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Sylvia Micas. I'm an attorney with Taft Law, and here with me today is Marcos Medina, owner of the located at 635 through 37 West 26th Street.

I thought we had a PowerPoint, but if not, I'll just go ahead. The subject property is...

[Speaker 18] (15:14 - 15:33)
Give us a second, Sylvia. Oh, sure. Give me a second.

Ready? Great. All right, let's go.

Thank you.

[Speaker 3] (15:33 - 17:04)
Next slide. Subject property as reflected on the zoning map is located on the southwest corner of South Lowe Avenue and West 26th Street. The property contains 3,183 square feet, is an improved with a two-story mixed-use building.

Next slide, please. The existing building's current building permit records reflect a legal commercial space on the first floor and two residential units on the second floor. However, the existing building's existing RT4 district limits the types of retail and commercial uses allowed within the legally established first floor commercial use.

Therefore, the applicant is here today seeking to amend the property from the existing RT4 district to a B1-2 district, which would be more closely aligned with the legally established first floor commercial unit, thus providing for a wider range of permitted retail and business uses within the ground floor. The second floor dwelling units will remain in compliance under a B1-2 district. There are no proposed additions or expansions to the existing building.

The applicant held a community meeting on June the 6th, and there were no objections raised at such time regarding the proposed zoning amendment. We would like to thank Alderman Lee, who has provided a letter of support, of which I believe the Committee on Zoning has a copy. This concludes our presentation.

We are available for questions.

[Speaker 1] (17:04 - 17:16)
All right, Sylvia, we do have a letter of support from Alderwoman Lee. Refresh my memory. So this is two commercial units?

One. Pardon me?

[Speaker 3] (17:16 - 17:44)
So, on the building permit records, this building has been legally established as having one commercial unit at grade and two residential units above. The issue is that the RT4 zoning district severely limits the ability to lease that commercial space. So that is the reason for the zoning change to a comparable zoning change, that being of a B1.

[Speaker 1] (17:44 - 17:55)
Okay, I get that. So it's vacant now. You're going to get more flexibility.

And this is two storefronts, which is it just, is it the corner unit?

[Speaker 3] (17:56 - 17:56)
It's just the corner.

[Speaker 1] (17:57 - 17:57)
Correct.

[Speaker 3] (17:58 - 17:58)
It's just the corner.

[Speaker 1] (17:59 - 18:07)
Great. All right. Again, we have a letter of support from Alderwoman Lee.

Alderwoman Lee, are you on the call? Do you want to comment on this?

[Speaker 19] (18:08 - 18:26)
Thank you, Chairman. I am on the call. I am in full support of this zoning change and look for favorable consideration from the committee on this.

What Mr. Medina is asking for, I think it's going to enhance the neighborhood. And I'm in full support of it.

[Speaker 1] (18:26 - 19:20)
Thank you. All right. Questions for the applicant or the Alderwoman?

Hearing none, can I get a motion to move do pass for the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? That is Alderman Wagesvac makes the motion. Any objections to the motion?

Hearing none, the item is passed. Bottom of page 10. Thank you.

Document number 21051 in the 10th ward ordinance was referred on June 22nd of 2022. Common addresses 11835 through 11901 South Avenue O. And the change request from M11 Limited Manufacturing Business Park District to M21 Light Industry District.

What do we have? Jordan Matus? Yep.

Good morning.

[Speaker 15] (19:21 - 19:21)
Good afternoon, Alderman.

[Speaker 18] (19:22 - 19:23)
Good afternoon.

[Speaker 15] (19:23 - 19:59)
Chairman, this is a correction. This is a Gallo Equipment has been located at these buildings for many years. This is one of three buildings they have.

They seek a permit to replace the roof, and they were denied because they have the wrong building. I'm sorry, the wrong business license. We need to change the zoning only so that they can continue the business they've been in for many, many years, which is the sale and rental of forklifts and other equipment.

So there's no changes to anything. It's simply a matter of correcting the business license and therefore allowing a roof permit to be issued.

[Speaker 1] (20:01 - 20:17)
Yeah. All right. We do have a letter of support from Alderwoman Garza.

Any questions, comments? How long has this been out of the proper licensing?

[Speaker 15] (20:19 - 20:22)
Well, they've been licensed probably four or five years.

[Speaker 1] (20:25 - 21:39)
Just sounds a little awkward, but obviously it's vetted through the Alderman's office, and we certainly want to keep this place in business. Unfortunately, with the roof leak, it entered into more problems than they expected. So that being said, can I get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

So moved Alderman Lopez, Chairman. Alderman Raymond Lopez moves do pass on that one. Any objections?

Hearing none, the item is passed. Speaking of the original Lopez, we were looking for you on your item, Raymond. West 59th.

West 59th Street, top of page 10, with Ms. Wendy Berry. That's a potential daycare on West 59th. She did get a letter that was provided by your office in support of that.

Yes. Okay. Just want to double check because I was trying to find you.

[Speaker 10] (21:39 - 21:41)
I'm sorry. Was it already voted on or no?

[Speaker 21] (21:41 - 21:42)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (21:42 - 21:46)
Well, contingent upon hearing from you. Yes.

[Speaker 10] (21:47 - 21:51)
Apologies, Chairman. I was trying to switch from committees. No problem.

I'm in full support. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (21:52 - 22:23)
Okay. All right. Now we're on top of page 11 in the eighth ward.

Document number 21058T1. Eighth Ward. Ordinance was referred on June 22nd of 2022.

Common address is 1122 East 87th Street. And the change request from M12 Limited Manufacturing Business Park District to C11 Neighborhood Commercial District. And we have James D.

Cristofano on this.

[Speaker 9] (22:23 - 22:26)
Good afternoon, Chairman and committee. Can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (22:27 - 22:29)
You can. Proceed. Okay.

[Speaker 9] (22:30 - 23:35)
I'm the attorney for the applicant on this. This is our change from an M12 district to a C11. The lot is a very large lot.

It's an irregular shaped triangle lot, 225,000 square feet. Improved with a one-story industrial building on it, which is 26,000 square feet per total square foot for that building. It is vacant.

On the inside, it is improved with a roller rink. And we would like to rezone or get the roller rink back up and running. That's been there for 40 years in the community.

And to help keep rejuvenating that area, which is turning from an industrial into a commercial zone for the eighth ward. We have a letter of support from Alderwoman Harris, and we have been working with her office throughout the year to help bring this, reopen this property.

[Speaker 1] (23:39 - 24:46)
We do have a letter of support from Alderwoman Harris on the reactivation of this entertainment use, I should say. Any questions, comments from committee members? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move to pass for the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

So moved, Chairman. Alderman Wagesbeck makes the motion move to pass. Any objections to the motion?

Hearing none, this item is passed. All right. Middle of page 11.

Thank you. Good luck. All right.

Middle of page 11, document number 21010, 23rd ward. Ordinance was referred on April 27th of 2022. Common address is 4424 West 55th Street.

And the change request from an RS2 residential single unit detached house district to an RT3.5 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district. We have Roberto Martinez on this item. Mr. Martinez.

[Speaker 11] (24:47 - 25:42)
Good morning, Chairman and ladies of the board, of the committee, excuse me. Attorney Robert Martinez, M-A-R-T-I-N-E-Z, appearing on behalf of applicant George Haro. We're here to request a rezoning from RS2 to RT3.5. The subject property is improved with a three-story brick building. And it currently has two dwelling units on a lot that is 6,500 square feet. There is a garage and also a carport for two additional cars, a total of four parking spaces. And we need the zoning change or the applicant needs the zoning change in order to accommodate for an additional unit to be put into the basement where adequate windows, lighting, and means of egress is already met.

[Speaker 1] (25:49 - 25:53)
Well, have you, have you talked to the alder woman or what?

[Speaker 11] (25:54 - 25:59)
Yes, of course. There is a letter of opposition.

[Speaker 1] (26:05 - 27:07)
All right. How do we get on off of Mr. Martinez? All right, Mr. Martinez, we do have a letter of support from alder woman Tavares. Any questions for the applicant? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call determined quorum. That is alder woman Pat Dowell makes the motion.

Any objections to her motion? Hearing none, this item is passed. All right, good luck.

Bottom of page 11, document number 20985 in the 11th ward. Ordinance was referred on March 23rd of 2022. Common address is 3155 South Union Avenue and the change request from an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RT4 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district.

We have Kate Duncan on this item in 11th ward.

[Speaker 7] (27:08 - 28:38)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee on zoning. My name is Kate Duncan. I'm an attorney at Ackerman LLC with offices at 71 South Becker drive.

I'm appearing this afternoon on behalf of the applicant, Mr. James Macione and connection with application number 20985. The subject property is located at 3155 South Union and the existing zoning for the property is an RS3 and seek to amend that zoning to an RT4. In 2005, a long time ago, I filed an application for this same zoning amendment, which was approved and passed by the city council.

Unfortunately, the ordinance that I drafted and that was passed had an error in the dimensions in the boundary description. And so the ordinance incorrectly described the applicant's property and incorrectly swept in a small portion of the property to the North of us and didn't sweep in all of our own property. So as a result, the purpose of this application is to correct the previous map amendment error in the boundary description.

And now to correctly describe the applicant's property so that the RT4 zoning is properly applied, applied to his property. So there's a single family home on the property and applicant has come back around again, seeking this amendment in order to add a joining unit to the property in order for his mother to reside on the property with him. We have received a letter of support from Alderwoman Lee for this zoning change.

And on behalf of my client, I respectfully request your favorable recommendation. And I'm happy to answer any questions you may have.

[Speaker 1] (28:39 - 29:09)
All right, Kate. Alderwoman Lee. Oh, so Kate, do we have a letter from Alderwoman Lee?

Yes. Okay. Okay.

So we have received a letter of support from Alderwoman Lee. Any questions, comments? Can I get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 18] (29:12 - 29:13)
Motion to pass.

[Speaker 1] (29:13 - 29:27)
Alderman Wagesack makes the motion. Any opposed to the motion? Hearing none, this item is passed.

All right. Thank you, Kate. All right.

Page 16.

[Speaker 20] (29:28 - 29:30)
Of the deferred agenda.

[Speaker 1] (29:30 - 29:32)
Of the deferred agenda.

[Speaker 20] (29:32 - 29:37)
This item did not appear on the committee members revised agenda.

[Speaker 1] (29:37 - 30:12)
All right, folks, it's been on the deferred agenda. It was noticed properly. I'll read it into the record.

Document number 20267-T1 in the second ward. Ordinance was referred on December 18th of 19. And then renoticed and republished.

A common address 1317 West Wrightwood Avenue. And the change request from a C11 neighborhood commercial district to B23 neighborhood mixed use district. Dan Lauer is on the call on this one.

[Speaker 5] (30:14 - 30:22)
Mr. Chairman, not as old as 2005, but pretty old. There is a substitute narrative in plans to RM5, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (30:23 - 30:36)
All right. Hold on a second. We do have you presented it to, is Ann Robles on this?

Okay. But no, he said to an hour.

[Speaker 16] (30:36 - 30:38)
Chairman, yes, I'm here.

[Speaker 1] (30:38 - 30:48)
Okay. So the change request from C11 neighborhood commercial district to what? RM5, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 20] (30:48 - 30:50)
And it's just a substitute ordinance, correct?

[Speaker 1] (30:51 - 30:53)
That's right. All right.

[Speaker 20] (30:53 - 30:53)
Publish the substitute.

[Speaker 1] (30:54 - 31:20)
Okay. So everything is kosher? Correct.

Okay. So do we need to accept? Okay.

So Alderman Wagesback makes a motion to pass on the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that? All right.

No objectors. So the substitute is in front of us. Again, C11 to, was it RM5?

[Speaker 5] (31:22 - 33:06)
Yes, Mr. Chairman. I represent Blair Dawson and Robert Adelson, their husband and wife. They've lived there for about 15 years.

This is C11 to RM5 residential multi-unit district. It's a larger lot for over there. Wonderful location, 33 foot wide by 125.

The records show that the structure was previously used as a two flat and maybe a three flat with a coach house. The owners wish to stay in the neighborhood, but they have no choice but to replace the building because it's frame construction. It was rehabbed without a permit.

There's some settling, water infiltration, et cetera, et cetera. They plan to build four new units with four garage parking spaces. Alderman Hopkins has been unbelievably patient with this process and he's held several community meetings.

The design was changed completely based on those meetings and based on input from the second ward and from the neighbors. The owners will live in the upper unit. We have numerous letters of support from the immediate neighbors.

And for the record, it's not part of this committee's review, but there will be a restrictive covenant recorded separately regarding private scavenger service so that there are no cans kept in the alley, either blue cans or recycling cans or black cans, and there'll be no short-term rentals. And again, I wish to stress, thank you very much to the second ward Alderman Hopkins and Brian Pellerin for their extreme amount of patience for this.

[Speaker 1] (33:09 - 33:25)
All right. Sounds like the Alderman was due diligence and patient, but cracked the whip too. Before we hear from Alderman Hopkins, Anna, do you have your hand up?

[Speaker 18] (33:28 - 33:50)
Yes, Chairman. What's the issue, Anna? I think you're muted, according to my...

Anna?

[Speaker 16] (33:51 - 34:08)
I'm sorry, can you hear me now? Yes, we can hear you now, Anna. Okay.

My apologies. Anna Robles, Chief Zoning Plan Examiner here in DPD. Dan, I just want to confirm that you submitted a substitute narrative and plans also to correct some errors done to the narrative.

[Speaker 5] (34:10 - 34:14)
Yes, Anna. I can send those by email to you in a minute, as soon as we log off.

[Speaker 16] (34:17 - 34:19)
I just wanted to make sure you put it on the record.

[Speaker 1] (34:20 - 34:23)
All right. So, Anna, have you not received this?

[Speaker 16] (34:24 - 34:30)
I have received the plans and narrative, but there's some corrections he still needs to do. So, just minor errors that were typos.

[Speaker 1] (34:31 - 35:07)
So, we'll move forward. Alderman Hopkins moved to accept the substantive narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, the substantive narrative and plans are accepted. And if you don't have it by tomorrow, we'll hold it, but it looks like it's going to be processed correctly. That's what my committee, that's what Nicole said.

Is that okay with you, Anna?

[Speaker 16] (35:07 - 35:14)
Yeah, my apologies. It wasn't on the list, so I didn't follow up with Dan prior to this meeting. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (35:14 - 35:17)
All right. Let's hear from Alderman Hopkins. Yeah.

[Speaker 2] (35:18 - 37:45)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As council said, this was a lengthy process resulting in significant changes and extensive community engagement. I do want to acknowledge that there remains some neighbors who are opposed to this.

The opposition centered really on two things after all the design revisions. There were two outstanding issues. Number one was the trash pickup in the alley.

And number two was simply the height. At 49 feet, some of the immediate neighbors to the east in a condominium complex just objected to the height. We were able to solve one of those two concerns.

As council mentioned, we did put in a restrictive covenant. It is my understanding and council can correct me if I'm wrong, but that a contract has been accepted with a private waste hauler. Even though this facility would be entitled to city pickup, the problem with that is because of the angle of the alley and its location where there's a 90 degree turn, putting the waste carts at that location in the alley on the apron would have interfered with vehicles trying to make that turn.

The solution is, as many of the private waste haulers do in the city now, the cans will be inside the garage or even inside what remains of the yard. But in either case, the private waste hauler as part of their service will get the cans, empty the cans in the truck and replace them. They will not be stored in the alley, period.

So we were able to work that out in specific detail. There's no wiggle room and the under no uncertain circumstances committed to honoring that agreement. So we solved that problem.

The height issue, the neighbors are just going to have to accept that because frankly, there's a number of other buildings, including the ones immediately next door and immediately across the street that are at the same height. So that was not an objection that I could fairly apply in this case, because it is within character on the block. And it's actually, it's a good design for these longtime homeowners.

So that is one that we simply couldn't solve, but they got 50% of their objections overcome. So with that, I am on record as supporting this project going forward. And we will make sure those corrections get made to ensure that we're able to approve this tomorrow.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (37:49 - 38:51)
Thank you all. Any questions, comments from committee members? Do pass Chairman Oliverman-Lopez.

Oliverman-Raymond Lopez moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, this item is passed with the substitute narrative and plans.

All right. All right. We have one more item.

We're going to go back to the 20th ward and it is the journal correction that corrects S0 2020-1111 passed by the committee on June 21st of 2022 for application number 20992. And it did pass city council on June 22nd of 2022 by replacing the pages that contained inaccurate information. And I believe that was a bulk table.

I was a bulk table item and is Mr. Brutus still? Yes. Yes.

Chairman. Yes. Good afternoon.

[Speaker 18] (38:51 - 38:51)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (38:51 - 39:12)
So you're correct. Okay. So just quickly, and I mean quickly because we're hopefully have found some resolution with the attorney and the alder woman.

So, but just to refresh us as committee members, would you say quickly what the, where the drama occurred?

[Speaker 8] (39:13 - 40:30)
Yes. For the record, Patrick Brutus department of planning and development, the item before you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee simply seeks to correct a certain number of pages that were improperly part of the packet that passed out of city council on June 22nd, 2022. The corrected ordinance here, the new one, which is direct to this committee and hope to pass out tomorrow has the proper documentation and includes the corrected pages.

The principal pages that were improperly part of the packet prior were PD statements and the bulk table. Those have been corrected. As you know, Mr. Chairman and other item surfaced today regarding the alderman support. The alderman is on this call. She has joined the committee as well as Graham Grady who is representing the developer. It appears as if we have some agreement on some of the changes that she has requested.

So your favorable passage of your paper will consideration of this particular ordinance will be appreciated and I'll allow the committee to discuss the rest of the items on the woman Taylor's agenda. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (40:35 - 40:51)
Is that the correct information was passed by plan commission, passed by the zoning committee, but when it was referred to the clerk is when the air and translation occurred.

[Speaker 8] (40:52 - 41:02)
Yes. The, the incorrect documents were submitted to the clerk. It was passed properly out of the plan commission.

Okay.

[Speaker 1] (41:02 - 41:25)
Just, just to re educate our committee members now. All right. So I'm going to defer to all the woman, Jeanette Taylor, would you like to speak on this or do you want Mr. Grady to speak first or what, what's your, what's your, what's your desire?

What's your desire?

[Speaker 14] (41:25 - 41:43)
You can let Mr. Grady speak first. As you all could tell I'm under the weather and I've been talking all day. And so once he's done, I'll be able.

And, and miss Annette, you all check your email. We sent over the, the info we're sending over the information that we put with this.

[Speaker 6] (41:46 - 43:14)
Go Alderman Taylor. Thank you very much for your assistance today. We're aware that earlier today you could have simply had the matter deferred, but you were very gracious to work with us over this last few hours.

And we thank you. We're grateful to you. And we're also pleased that it appears that the language that has been proposed by the law department subject to the revision and corrections that you've made will be satisfactory to you as well as to the law department and the applicant.

Chairman Tunney, I wanted to also thank you for allowing this matter to be extended to the end of the hearing today. We thank you for that indulgence here. Alderman Taylor, we're in agreement substantively.

We will adhere to the changes that you are making even as we speak. And with that, you have our word from Greg Olson and Leon Walker and myself that we'll work through the details as being added and revised by you. Now, we'd be very grateful to you, Alderman Taylor, if you would allow this zoning correction to go forward today, as we desperately need it to be approved by the committee today and the full council tomorrow and, and, and execution.

And I think Anna Robles, I think you're not on right now. She is on mute now. Sorry.

Sorry. No problem, Anna. Sorry about that.

So Chairman Tunney and Alderman Taylor, that's where we are, I believe. I think we're there.

[Speaker 1] (43:15 - 43:20)
All right. Let us hear from Alderman Jeanette Taylor.

[Speaker 14] (43:29 - 44:05)
Thank you, Chairman and members of the committee. We are making the necessary changes. And we expect what this is introduced that all necessary parts will be in this ordinance.

And they also answer another question. Because the only thing that's on there is there's not an explanation. There's an explanation missing or some details missing.

And I'll make sure that because Joan is working on this. She says it to you all ASAP. I ask that you all send it back to before the close of business day.

Thank you, Chairman Tunney and members of the committee.

[Speaker 1] (44:06 - 44:21)
Okay, Alderwoman. So what you're asking us to do is to approve it and that there was still work to be done before reporting it out of committee tomorrow. Is that correct?

Absolutely.

[Speaker 6] (44:22 - 44:35)
Okay. But Chairman, Chairman, I just want to make a distinction. The documents that Alderman Taylor is editing now are totally unrelated from the application that's before the committee on zoning.

[Speaker 1] (44:35 - 44:57)
Right, right. This is an RDA agreement with the Alderman, which is not the purview. But I'm looking, I am deferential to the local alder person to make sure that she's comfortable with activity in her ward.

So with that, we do have, is there a question up? Who's up? Who's got is that Raymond?

[Speaker 10] (44:58 - 45:03)
Sorry, I was going to make the motion do pass pending final approval for tomorrow.

[Speaker 1] (45:03 - 45:27)
All right. Thank you for the motion. Alderman Raymond Lopez makes the motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, this item is passed and Alderwoman Taylor and I, we will, we will be certainly talking tomorrow. Okay.

All right.

[Speaker 6] (45:27 - 45:27)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (45:27 - 45:28)
Thank you, Alderman Taylor.

[Speaker 6] (45:29 - 45:31)
Thank you, Alderman Tony. All right.

[Speaker 1] (45:31 - 45:39)
Now, I, staff, we are, we are done. So can I get a motion to adjourn?

[Speaker 10] (45:39 - 45:41)
Move to adjourn Chairman. All right.

[Speaker 1] (45:41 - 45:51)
Alderman Ray Lopez moves to adjourn. Any objections? Hearing none.

We made it before five. I hope that you feel better.

[Speaker 18] (45:51 - 45:52)
Thank you Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (45:53 - 45:57)
All right. All right. So this meeting is adjourned.

We'll see y'all tomorrow. Thank you everybody.
