Great. Thank you, Alderman. This time we will move on to public comments.

The public comment period will be limited to 30 minutes. Out of respect for everyone's time, each speaker is limited to three minutes. We have nine public speakers.

We'll start with Mr. George Blakemore. Mr. Blakemore.

[Speaker 23] (24:49 - 27:53)
I'm quite at home here. I've been coming down here for maybe 30 or 40 years, and the game keeps continuing. Who is this old man that's all painted up, talking loud and cursing?

I'm somebody, and I know how this system is now working. When Solis was here, it was corrupt and fraught, and now they got a new one. I think this is Rosa.

I don't know, taking his place or something. It's all a game, all a dog and pony show. You can get anything done in the city of Chicago anywhere and anytime if you got money.

This is all about money, and some of these zoning lawyers I've been seeing for years, for years. See, they got a little niche here. The people go to these zoning lawyers and pay, and then they play.

They can get anything resolved. Now, right at Burton and Dearborn, a little old irregular lot, and you couldn't build on it. It was built on.

Why did they do this? Because of money. Money talks and bulls.

It's corruption here. A one-party system here. The democratic machine, and don't get mad at the ultimates.

Get mad at the people. You, you, you, you, you, and all of you. You know how this game is played.

You're not new here, and it goes on and on and on because of you. This is why the city doesn't work. Don't land on these political hacks, these so-called elected officials.

The machine picks them, and then you vote for them. You don't pick them. So, there's something wrong with each one of you, and when I was hollering and cursing, oh, why did I have two meetings at the same time?

They looked at me like I'm crazy. Maybe you are crazy. Maybe we are crazy.

Maybe all of us have a mental health problem. This is the month of May, or at times they say the month of mental health. Health is wealth, and it's something evil here, something corrupt here, something un-American here with the games that are being played here.

Now, I'm talking sit down, sit down. You see how disrespectful? They said, look at him.

Mr. Sit down, you political hack lawyer, you. This is not the time for you to be meeting.

[Speaker 1] (27:54 - 28:44)
Thank you, Mr. Blakemore. Next up, we have, thank you, Mr. Blakemore. Please have a seat.

Next up, we have T.J. Hughes, Theresa Hughes. I think I saw her earlier. Hi, T.J., and after Ms. Hughes will be Zoe Lee. Go ahead, Ms. Hughes. Thank you.

[Speaker 26] (28:44 - 31:10)
Thanks, Alderman. Good morning, everybody. My name is Theresa T.J. Hughes, and I am here representing an advocacy for black contractors, and my issue is with the fact that the percentages for our black contractors are pitiful. We are, according to the city's records, we are only getting 3% of all the contracts that have been let by the city, which at the time of this, it was like $879 million that was spent, and out of that, we only got 3%. The Asians got less than 7%, and Hispanics got 30%. So, I'm like, I'm with Mr. Blakemore on that. There is something wrong here, and I'm here to ask you all to look into Eileen Velasquez, who is the Commissioner for, what is she, Chief Procurement Officer for the Department of Procurement Services. I would ask that you also have the IG look into that department along with the Chicago Department on Aviation, which is Jamie Reed, because the black contractors are not getting their fair share, and all these things that are happening in our community, we don't see blacks out there working. You know, we know how to do the streets and the curves and all that and this and whatever, so I know this is zoning, landmarks, and buildings.

It should all come together. We should be a part of that, and you and I, we should hold each other accountable. I'm looking at the audience here, it's only about five or six of us black people.

What is the deal with that? We need to be accountable. We need to tell our people, get down here and participate.

If we're not here to represent, then we really don't have a voice. We really shouldn't be complaining and bitching if we're not going to take part of it. You know, so hold me accountable, because I'm going to hold you accountable, and you know I love you Bennett, but I'm going to hold you accountable too, okay?

Thank you so much.

[Speaker 1] (31:10 - 31:18)
Thank you, Ms. Hughes. Up next, Zoe Lee, and followed by Simon Shin.

[Speaker 30] (31:19 - 31:26)
Shoot. All right, you know I'm gonna start.

[Speaker 31] (31:30 - 31:42)
There are three things you can do if you want money for demolished property. If we're just talking about a little bit of money, the Alderman's Committee on Finance, and I'm surprised your alderman didn't mention that too.

[Speaker 30] (31:42 - 34:02)
All right, so this committee on zoning, landmarks, and building standards. As you know, I've been coming down here for a year, because the city of Chicago, with the help of the building department, illegally demolished my building, which is the Fifth Amendment, and we have yet to be compensated. I've done all the research when it comes to building standards and how you're supposed to do this, but only in the Black community do y'all get away with knocking down our buildings and do not compensate, because a lot of us do not know the Constitution, or do not know the Fifth Amendment, and do not know the rules when it comes to demolished property in the state of Illinois.

And again, like I said, there's Blight Property Act 1947 and 1949. If you feel like it was an issue with the property, you have to go to the governor, and then the governor has to go to the attorney general, and then they can eminent domain it, and you still have to compensate the person. That was my generational wealth, that was my commercial building, that was everything, and that's what y'all continue to do in our communities, because no one does not do anything.

I currently have a federal lawsuit against the city of Chicago, and on top of that, my mother did the second thing, which was to file a claim with the city of Chicago, which is self-insured, and you guys refused to pay out that claim and said that was the whole, what was it, she didn't put it in on time. What she did, and that was insurance fraud, which is bad faith insurance fraud, so that's a whole nother lawsuit. I'm going to continue to come down here, and again, this is election year, I am not the one.

I swear to God, everybody will go down, it'll be Operation Graylord, because at the end of the day, it starts with the aldermen, the aldermen keep fucking selling us out in our communities, and that's just what y'all do, and y'all think y'all can continue to do this, but just, you got the right black person, the right black person. Settle my case, Mary Richardson Lowry, sit down with David Alderman Moore, the 17th Ward, who did not come to my family and do what he was supposed to do when it was time to pay us out. I am not the one.

[Speaker 1] (34:04 - 34:19)
Thank you. Up next, Simon Shue, and while we do that, we have additional members, Villegas, Beal, Cruz, Fuentes, Mosley, and Ramirez. Anyone else I missed?

Great. Mr. Shue.

[Speaker 35] (34:19 - 36:13)
Hi. My name is Simon Shue, and I'm talking about the 3200 South Wallace. They would like to reopen the Redwood Bar.

I saw my alderman, Nicole Lee, have a piece of paper, 10 of them, and then number three, they just look like 10 commandments. Number three, because within one mile, we have five elementary schools over here, and then why we have the bar over there, and then on her proposal, I would, on the weekday, they close at 10, I would prefer they close at, no, sorry, they close at 11, I prefer they close at 10 o'clock because a lot of kids around the neighborhood have to go to sleep and then go back to school, and then since this is the 11th Ward, we should have one more, 11 commandments, okay, just like on the Independence Day and Memorial Weekend, we should let them open a little bit late because it's a holiday, okay, and then on July, no one go to school, they may close a week later, okay, that's my proposal, just like we have to find a way how to cause sleeping, and then it's like, understand, because I do some research, a lot of parents with their kids go to school, they would like to close earlier, but the single people say, I don't care, okay, so for me, of course, I live close by, I would like just like a gangster, but somehow, a lot of people have different opinion, and then I just want to speak my opinion, I would like they, on the weekday, close at 10 p.m. instead of 11. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (36:14 - 36:23)
Thank you, Mr. Hsu. Up next is Lisa Gant Parker, who will be followed by Michelle Strasburger.

[Speaker 15] (36:39 - 36:40)
Good morning.

[Speaker 1] (36:40 - 36:40)
Good morning.

[Speaker 15] (36:41 - 39:49)
Two years ago, my daughter and I purchased a home at 4029 South Vincennes. We have been working on the rehab since that time and are hoping and praying to reach completion soon. In April of the same year, a developer purchased the adjacent lot.

The developer rehabbed the existing 4,914 square foot three flat that was on the 3,250 square foot property next to ours. I did send a picture, and the gravestone is to the left. I'm contesting building on the remaining land, as I believe in doing so, my home would become non-compliant with city code, city building code.

For context, my home is a two flat that is already attached to another building on the south side. It is a traditional gravestone townhouse. As a result, the majority of the home's windows are on the freestanding north side of the building.

There are a total of two windows on the back and 13 plus windows on the south side of the, I'm sorry, on the north side of the building. I believe construction of the property at 4023 South Vincennes would place the rooms, in particular, the three bedrooms of our building out of compliance with natural light code 13172070 set by the city's zoning department. I believe we will no longer be able to meet the minimum required.

As I said earlier, there is already a 4,900 square foot structure on the 3,250 square foot lot. An additional building would, an additional three flat, would put the dwelling density at almost three times the square foot of the lot. It does not take into consideration also zoning code 17170304.

The lot in question is 3,250 square feet. Splitting the lot would create two 1,625 square foot lots. The RM5 zoning indicates that the minimum lot per area dwelling is 1,000 feet.

Three square units, you will need 3,000. You would need a minimum of 3,000 square feet per lot. The proposed building takes up more space than the lot has.

I also saw an email from the architect on the project. She indicates that the prior requirement has been met.

[Speaker 1] (39:50 - 40:05)
Thank you, Ms. Parker. Your time has expired. I'm going to have staff connect with you just so we can get more information as well.

Thank you. And we do have your letter in the packet, just so all members know that. Up next, Michelle Strasburger, who will be followed by Ward Miller.

[Speaker 22] (40:08 - 43:13)
Hi, I'm Michelle Strasburger, a resident on Hubbard Street, and I'm speaking today regarding the approved zoning for the 400 North Elizabeth project. I'd like to start out by stating that the stakeholder community members were misrepresented by Alderman Burnett and John from Neighbors of River West. If they are referring to the meeting notes from the hybrid meeting at the church and the official vote of residents within 250 feet, it was an overwhelming no majority.

The next WCA and River North meeting two days later had an unofficial vote, and again, the majority was a no. The system is broken. I'm not against change, just unwarranted upzoning after square footage was increased by over 300% from its original zoning three years ago.

Guidelines were not adhered to. It is the responsibility of the property owner seeking rezoning to contact every residential property owner within 250 residential feet, not including businesses, not to be delegated to community groups only using sign-up sheets from their previous month's meeting in order to send out their notifications. How is it that a community representation...

Oh, I just lost it, sorry. Of the approximately 60 to 80 residential pin property owners immediately affected, maybe only 10 received mailed notices, and no homeowner association presidents were even contacted, especially the one directly across the street. Additionally, how would we be able to see the fire department approval of the street level safety plan for the south side, Kinsey side?

Because I'm baffled how a fire truck or engine is supposed to set up for a fire on the south side of the west tower as there's only 10 foot 7 inches instead of 20 feet due to the overhang of the glazed wall of that whole south elevation. And when was the latest traffic study completed? Was it from the previous life science building or was a new traffic study done recently?

Because I'm just wondering if CDOT is aware of the blind spot exiting right onto Ogden, and it's extremely hazardous. Also the hazards of multiple idling trains and their fumes deflecting from the new buildings toward the residents on Elizabeth and Hubbard Street, as well as the additional noise pollution of multiple trains.

[Speaker 1] (43:14 - 43:35)
Thank you, Ms. Strasburger. Your time has expired. Up next is Ward Miller, followed by John Bosco, and also we have been joined by Alderman LaSpada, committee member, and then Alderman Coleman and Alderman Cardona, who are our guests.

Got her. Ward Miller.

[Speaker 37] (43:36 - 45:13)
Thank you. Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. I'm Ward Miller, the Richard H.

Treehouse Executive Director of Preservation Chicago. We at Preservation Chicago support the Minimum Lot Area Reduction Amendment, document number 020240088948, introduced by Alderman Riley. Realizing that this supports the conversion of former office buildings, many of them historic, to residential units, and we feel that this will be an amazing and beneficial and transformational aspect to the revisioning of the Chicago Loop in downtown Chicago and many of the historic buildings that are currently facing huge occupancy issues.

Also on another note regarding 3731 to 3733 North Sheffield, also known as the Wrigley Field Flats, we want to the developer and this commission to encourage preservation at least of the limestone facades. These are part of a grouping of historic buildings that are across from Wrigley Field, a Chicago landmark, and recognizing the historic properties of that development and the renovation of Wrigley Field, we think that this really does support the authenticity of Wrigley Field and the adjoining neighborhood. So we want to encourage this development to go forward, but to look at revisioning and rethinking, redesigning those facades to include these historic buildings, these limestone facades.

So thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (45:14 - 45:21)
Thank you, Mr. Miller. Up next is John Bosco, and then our last speaker will be Adam Friedberg.

[Speaker 16] (45:23 - 48:17)
Good morning. My name is John Bosco, neighbors of River West. I've been part of the community and part of neighbors of River West now for over 30 years.

During that time, our boundaries have contracted. We were part of River North as well as the West Loop. Right now, our boundaries are on the north side, which would be Division.

On the south is Kinsey. To the east is River, the River, Chicago River. And then on the west side is the Kennedy and Ogden Avenue.

At this time, right now, we're also seeing a huge influx of development in regards to what was always referred to as the hole in the donut. The hole in the donut would be what we now know as the Tribune properties, as well as the north side and south side, the insertion plant, as well as Greyhound, which we know that will be coming along here soon. The idea of community is something that is important to us.

However, what we've learned, though, with the recent adoption of the ordinance for the casino for Bally's coming in, community host agreement is with the entire city. It's included in the entire city. River West and some of the neighborhood groups there, although we were aware of it, we didn't participate in that host agreement.

In this particular instance, I'm referring to 400 North Elizabeth. This is the second time that we've reviewed this PD. The first time was for a life science building.

At this time, right now, we were presented with the residential development. 734 units, 140 plus units of affordable that would be there. What the developer has expressed to us is that their willingness to do more affordable housing.

As you've heard already from other testimony, there is opposition to this, especially for those folks who live closest. If you look at the letter that is on file, there is reference to that, as well as people who are across the way. We recognize that.

On the other hand, we're also recognizing what development has been proposed by planning, by the staff there, and over time how those boundaries have changed and expanded to address the functionally obsolete properties that are there and look for further development. As everyone knows, the Fulton Market District is expanding, it's booming, it's a huge source of revenue for the city, the unions, and for the tax base. So because of these reasons and because of the work that's been done already and the precedent is there, Neighbors of River West will support 400 North Elizabeth.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (48:19 - 48:24)
Thank you, Mr. Boska. And last is Adam Friedberg.

[Speaker 38] (48:25 - 48:27)
Hi, good morning. My name is Adam Friedberg.

[Speaker 1] (48:27 - 48:29)
I'm the CEO of Maverick Development.

[Speaker 38] (48:30 - 49:36)
I run a local development company here in Chicago. I'm here to speak in support of the MLA reduction ordinance. As we all probably know, there will be nearly no cranes in Chicago next year building apartment buildings, a symptom of interest rates and outside of our control.

And what that means is that we need to be more creative. I'm committed to building apartment buildings in Chicago and creating more homes and more affordable homes for the residents of Chicago. I think the best way to do that right now is to look at converting vacant office buildings.

It's a no-brainer. They're great locations, they're great buildings. The biggest problem with them for a lot of the cases is that they're too big.

And I think a really great solution is to remove the MLA from those buildings because it allows us to redevelop those buildings into vibrant, mixed-use, multifamily buildings where people can live, work in the city of Chicago. So I appreciate your time and look forward to continuing to develop and invest in Chicago.

[Speaker 1] (49:37 - 50:04)
Great. Thank you, Mr. Friedberg. That concludes our public comment.

Thanks to all of you for participating. We're going to move on to the agenda. We have three mayoral appointments.

All committee members will find copies of their resumes before them in their packets. We have one via Zoom and the others are joining. We also have Alderman Hopkins, committee member here for quorum.

Anyone else sneak in that I didn't see?

[Speaker 34] (50:04 - 50:05)
No.

[Speaker 1] (50:07 - 50:28)
I got you. I got you. Great.

All right. First up is document number A, 2024-0008929, the appointment of Adrian Soto as a member of the Zoning Board of Appeals. We have Mr. Soto here. Make sure his mic is on to introduce himself and answer any questions.

[Speaker 28] (50:30 - 52:35)
Great. Good morning, everybody. My name is Adrian Soto.

I'm Executive Director for Greater Southwest Development Corporation. I'm here to introduce myself and express my interest in contributing to the Zoning Board of Appeals. My journey has been guided by a strong commitment to community development and a passion for fostering sustainable, vibrant neighborhoods.

As a proud Chicago native and son of undocumented Mexican immigrants, I am driven by a vision to uplift the communities in our city. Growing up on the South Side, a place rich in history, culture, and resilience, I witnessed both the challenges and immense potential within our neighborhoods. This personal connection has given me a unique perspective and a strong motivation to work tirelessly for the prosperity of our area.

My expertise lies in offering comprehensive resources to small business owners, including marketing strategies, government procurement opportunities, and access to capital. Additionally, I have extensive experience in economic and real estate development, focusing on transforming underutilized properties into vibrant community assets. With almost 20 years of experience, I have successfully overseen initiatives that enhance residents' quality of life, promote business growth, and improve community infrastructure.

In my role at Greater Southwest, I've had the privilege of collaborating with a diverse set of stakeholders, including government agencies, elected officials, local businesses, residents, to drive meaningful change. I am here today because I believe in the power of community-driven development. I am committed to harnessing my skills and experience to support initiatives that increase employment opportunities, strengthen small businesses, and enhance the overall well-being of our neighborhoods.

This role represents an opportunity for me to continue making a positive impact and to ensure that our communities thrive for generations to come. My leadership style is collaborative and inclusive, ensuring that community members' voices are heard and integrated into our projects, and I am dedicated to fostering an environment of innovation, resilience, and growth. If approved, I look forward to working with each of you.

Together, we can continue to build a stronger, more vibrant community. Thank you for your consideration.

[Speaker 1] (52:36 - 52:41)
Thank you, Mr. Soto. Do we have any questions by committee members? Alderman Moore?

[Speaker 33] (52:42 - 53:28)
Yes. Thank you, Chairman. I think this will be a fine appointment.

I know it will be. I've worked with Mr. Adrian Soto of the Greater Southwest Development Corporation for several years now. Communication and collaboration, even when it can be challenging conversations, he has them, but he also acts to move on things that I can appreciate about him.

As we continue to work together on the Greater Southwest side, this will be an asset to that community. So, I definitely support this. Unless anybody else has any comments or questions, I move to pass this item.

[Speaker 1] (53:29 - 53:31)
Great. Thank you. Alderman Knudtson?

[Speaker 11] (53:32 - 54:11)
Thank you, Mr. Vice Chair, and Adrian, congratulations on the appointment. The Zoning Board of Appeals is a pretty impactful board. There are only five regular members, and it's a good thing that these members are finally getting appointed, because without three votes, matters cannot go through the board.

So, one question for you, it's a little bit abstract, but it's going to come up as you become a voting member of the ZBA. So, that question is just how will you balance situations where there's community opposition that goes against aldermanic recommendation?

[Speaker 28] (54:12 - 54:36)
That's a great question. I think that's a sensitive topic where to come up, and I expect it to come up before the ZBA. I think it's a matter of balancing the needs of the city as a whole and the local community concerns, and also listening and asking a lot of questions to the local elected official, in this case, the alderman.

So, I would try to get as much information as possible and make sure that we're adhering to zoning ordinances and laws as well. So, it's a balancing act.

[Speaker 33] (54:37 - 54:37)
Great.

[Speaker 11] (54:38 - 54:52)
And I'd say, study up on those standards. Those standards are everything. There's a lot of gray area.

And again, just happy that this kind of impactful, independent board is getting filled. So, congratulations. You'll have my support.

[Speaker 28] (54:52 - 54:52)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (54:54 - 55:09)
Great. Thank you, alderman. We have alderman Rodriguez has also joined us, non-member.

Anyone else wish to speak on this item? Right on time. Alderman Rodriguez.

Thank you, Mr. Chair.

[Speaker 3] (55:09 - 55:27)
I just came down because I saw that Adrian was being, I knew he was on the agenda, but I didn't know it was coming up so quick. I just wanted to say he's an absolute stalwart on the Southwest side of Chicago, doing great work on development projects. Couldn't think of a better individual to be in this situation.

So happy Adrian is being put forth to this committee.

[Speaker 1] (55:27 - 55:33)
And I urge my colleagues to give an aye vote on this one. So, thank you, Mr. Chair.

[Speaker 23] (55:33 - 55:33)
Great.

[Speaker 1] (55:33 - 55:43)
Thank you, alderman. Anything else from members? Hearing none, alderman Moore moves do pass on the appointment.

All in favor, please say aye.

[Speaker 28] (55:43 - 55:43)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (55:43 - 56:42)
Any opposed? Opinion of the chair, the ayes have it and the appointment is passed. Next, we are going to discuss the two appointments for the plan commission, sort of question-wise each.

I'm going to read both in. I know we have Tanya Kadakia is on Zoom and Camila Brooks is here in person. So, next is document number A, 2024-0008927, the appointment of Tanya Kadakia as member of the Chicago Plan Commission.

I'm also going to read in the appointment of it's A, 2024-0008928925, the appointment of Camila Brooks as a member of the Chicago Plan Commission. Ms. Brooks, are you here with us on Zoom? I'm sorry.

Ms. Brooks is here in person. I'm sorry. Ms. Kadakia is here on Zoom. Yes. Great. We will start with Ms. Brooks.

[Speaker 18] (56:43 - 58:48)
Good morning and thank you, Chairman Lawson and city council members of the Zoning Landmarks and Building Standards Committee for your time and consideration of my nomination for appointment to the plan commission for the city of Chicago. It is with great gratitude and honor to be nominated for this role and to serve the city of Chicago in this capacity. My name is Camila Brooks.

I am a current resident of the South Loop neighborhood where my family and I have resided for the past six years. I currently serve as director of development for the Community Builders, a non-profit developer with a mission to build and sustain strong mixed income, mixed use neighborhoods throughout the city of Chicago. In my role at the Community Builders, I oversee developments on the south and west side, including Oak Ridge Shores, a public housing redevelopment in Bronzeville, the Sankofa Wellness Village, a health and wellness center in West Garfield Park, and future phases of South Bridge, an affordable, equitable, transit-oriented development in South Loop.

Furthermore, my professional background includes more than a decade in affordable housing and community development. I hold a bachelor of science degree in interior architecture and a master of urban design. And most recently, I received a master of business administration from the Loyola University of Chicago.

I am passionate about working alongside communities to bring investments into neighborhoods that ensure every person in this city has access to housing, education, jobs, healthcare amenities, and overall better quality of life. Equally, I value working with communities to understand their mission, vision, and goals, and aligning resources to achieve those goals. If provided the opportunity to serve on the plan commission, I will draw from my experiences working across the city and beyond.

I will respectfully listen to fellow commissioners and council members, and I will strive to make decisions that advance the city of Chicago's economic and community development goals. Thank you for your time. I look forward to your favorable consideration of my appointment to the plan commission.

Thank you again.

[Speaker 1] (58:49 - 58:51)
Thank you, Ms. Brooks. Ms. Kadakia?

[Speaker 32] (58:51 - 1:01:11)
Good morning. Good morning, Alderpersons. My name is Tanya Kadakia, and I am honored to be nominated to the Chicago Plan Commission.

I believe deeply that safe, well-managed, affordable housing are central to the success of families and society, which is why I've spent my career of more than 25 years in this field. My housing real estate development experience includes launching the housing team for DL3 Realty Advisors, where I led the Thrive Exchange Project in South Shore and the Thrive Inglewood Project, both of which are affordable workforce housing developments with mixed-use aspects. I also led work on Holston Development's Wilson Yard Project, which includes seniors and family housing in an urban format target store.

My real estate finance background includes as vice president and relationship manager at leading companies, including National Equity Fund, Enterprise Community Investments, and BMO Harris Bay. Most recently, I've started my own company, Rod Iron Partners, to take on the high-impact projects that most interest me. In starting my business, I hope to be an example to other women that a career in real estate development and that starting your own company are both possible and on the table.

I am particularly proud of my current engagement with Local Initiative Support Corporation and the Illinois Housing Development Authority in the NextGen Project. The NextGen Capacity Building Initiative is a project for which I'm developing training and technical assistance to expand the future talent pipeline and increase diversity among affordable housing developers in the state, especially for developing with low-income housing tax credits, which is a very complex program and from which there are high barriers to entry. My volunteer positions include with the Chicago Housing Trust, where I serve on the finance committee.

I've also served on the board of Bickerdike Redevelopment Corporation, Women's Affordable Housing Network, and the Rebuilding Exchange. I would be very excited to be on planned commission to participate with the city in the city's future in such a meaningful way and to contribute to making the city its best and to work collaboratively with other commission members, the talented city staff, and the entrepreneurial and innovative residents of our city. I look forward to working with you and the members of your ward, and I thank you very much for your consideration.

[Speaker 1] (1:01:13 - 1:01:18)
Thank you, Ms. Kadakia. I have questions from committee members. All the members spot up.

[Speaker 6] (1:01:20 - 1:02:40)
Thank you so much, Chair. Ms. Kadakia, Ms. Brooks, a preemptive and hopeful and optimistic welcome to the planned commission. I will say it's been one of the most thrilling and unexpected opportunities of this term for me, and you all bring such, both of you bring such interesting skill sets and resumes.

I'm looking at your resumes and your experiences. They feel tailor made to the work of the planned commission. I will actually, Ms. Kadakia, I will say your reputation precedes you. Very glad for your appointment. Ms. Brooks, we have not had as much of an opportunity. I love what you've done.

Like if I may ask like two very sincere questions. Your master's of urban design, I find that a fascinating angle on the planning educational space. I'm so curious how that informs, that degree informs your professional work.

I also saw that you spent a significant amount of your educational professional life in Charlotte, which is a city of fascinating planning challenges and development opportunity, and I'm so curious how what you learned and experienced in Charlotte informs the work that you're doing here in Chicago.

[Speaker 18] (1:02:41 - 1:04:12)
Thank you for the question and great question. I'll start with the second part. And so I have spent some time in Charlotte, including studying, getting a master of urban design.

You know, when I think about the work that I did in Charlotte, a part of that was focused on what we're now working on now around process improvement. I had the good fortune in Charlotte to spend quite a bit of time working on a task force that focused on accelerating affordable housing. And so spent time there really expediting that work and working in partnership with their neighborhood and business services, which is comparable to the city of Chicago's department of housing on ways in which they could cut the tape to accelerate and address the need for affordable housing.

And so I would definitely look to leverage those experiences that I gained in Charlotte and bring that here to Chicago on the plan commission and really focus on how do we accelerate and increase delivering housing in a quicker, faster way, because the need for affordable housing hasn't shrunk yet. And so that's one piece. And then thanks for the other question around the master of urban design.

You know, I studied interior architecture and urban design, so I had sort of a micro and a macro look at the built environment and have certainly been able to that when I think about real estate development and ensuring that the spaces and places that are built reflect the needs of the community and certainly have pulled on and leveraged those experiences from an educational background. Thank you for those questions.

[Speaker 6] (1:04:13 - 1:04:25)
You're so very welcome. You're hitting all the points. It will be a pleasure serving with both of you.

They are long meetings, so I look forward to having time to get to know both of you better. Thank you, Chair. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:25 - 1:04:31)
Thank you all on the spot. Any other questions by committee members? Alderman Robinson.

[Speaker 14] (1:04:33 - 1:05:04)
Chairman, thank you for allowing me the opportunity. I just wanted to give Kamina Brooks kudos for taking the time and her busy schedule to do this great work. So Kamina, I commend you.

I work with Kamina and community builders in the fourth ward and know that her experience will be very much so needed in her new role. So I look forward to working alongside of you, and thank you again. And, Chairman, thank you for the opportunity.

[Speaker 1] (1:05:05 - 1:06:08)
Thank you, Alderman. Anyone else? Seeing none, Alderman Espada makes a motion to approve, enthusiastically approve, both nominations of Tanya Kadakia and Kamina Brooks.

All in favor, please say aye. Any opposed? Nay?

Any opinion, Chair, the ayes have it and will be reported out at tomorrow's meeting. Congratulations and thank you to you both. Best of luck.

Best of luck. Thank you. All right.

Moving on to landmarks. First up is document number O-2024-0008905, an ordinance to approve the Adopt-a-Landmark Grant Funding Agreement with ECG Madison, LLC, for the preservation project at 801 West Madison to South Halstead in the 34th Ward. We have Daniel Cliver of the Historic Preservation Division of the Department of Planning and Development to present on this matter and answer any questions.

We also have Matt Crawford as well.

[Speaker 36] (1:06:08 - 1:08:04)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. Dan Cliver with the Department of Planning and Development. I'm here with an Adopt-a-Landmark Grant Project from DPD's 2023 funding round.

The ordinance before you would grant ECG Madison, LLC, a $1.3 million Adopt-a-Landmark Grant for restoration work to the former Mid-City Bank and Trust building. The property is located at the southwest corner of Halstead and Madison streets on the near west side. The bank building was constructed between 1911 and 1928 and was designated as an individual Chicago landmark in 2012.

ECG Madison purchased the currently vacant building in 2022 and intends to convert the former bank for use as the neighborhood hotel. Floors two through six will be the primary hotel floors with a portion of the ground floor and basement to be used for hotel lobby and service areas, retail, and or restaurant tenants. Tenant improvements will be phase two of the project and are not part of the Adopt-a-Landmark Project.

The scope of work was reviewed and conditionally approved by the Permit Review Committee in October of 2023, the Landmarks Commission in March of 2024. In addition, a class L for the overall $53 million project was reviewed by the commission in January of this year and was approved last week by the City Council Economic Capital and Technology Development Committee. The main benefits of the project are the creation of approximately 65 construction jobs, 10 to 15 permanent jobs, Energy Star requirements as part of a class L, and NBEWBE city residency requirements as part of the Adopt-a-Landmark Project.

The project is located in the 34th Ward and Alderman Conway is supportive of the project and is here today as well. Finally, I believe that Ed Cuss is sitting right next to me and he is present representing the owner. That concludes my presentation.

[Speaker 1] (1:08:05 - 1:08:09)
Thank you, Mr. Kliber. Mr. Cuss, no stranger to the committee, please add.

[Speaker 17] (1:08:10 - 1:08:49)
For the record, Mr. Chairman, Ed Cuss, an attorney with Taft, here today on behalf of the applicant and sitting to my left joining me is Mr. Jonathan Gordon, who is the founder of the Neighborhood Hotel Group, which will be the operator of this particular hotel. We just wanted to express our thanks for your consideration for this class L. This building is about 100 years old and I don't know if Dan mentioned it, but it's been vacant since 2005, so there's been a lot of deterioration to the building and Jonathan, I know, looks forward to getting this building rehabbed and putting it back to productive use.

So, thank you, we appreciate your consideration.

[Speaker 1] (1:08:50 - 1:08:51)
Great, thank you. Alderman Conway?

[Speaker 5] (1:08:52 - 1:09:37)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yeah, as some of you may recall who are on Economic Development Committee, this did come up very successfully on a class L, class L last time, in which both the developer and Unite Here came and spoke in support of this project. As indicated, this is a beautiful old bank building that has been vacant and abandoned for close to 20 years and as Mr. Koss indicated, it's really hard to understate how sort of dilapidated the inside of this building is and with your help and support, this dilapidated gem will become a real beacon for North Greektown, so I ask for and appreciate your support. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:09:37 - 1:10:15)
Great, thank you, Alderman. Any questions by committee members? No.

Alderman Riley, moves do pass. All in favor, say aye. Any opposed, say nay.

Seeing the Chair, the ayes have it. The motion is passed and we'll report it out. Thank you.

Best of luck. Good luck with the work. It's a very sharp, sharp, sharp building.

Next up is document number O-2024-0008744, the historic landmark designation for the John B. Murphy Memorial, located at 50 East Erie in the 42nd Ward. We have Matt Crawford of the Historic Preservation Division of the Department of Planning and Development to present on this matter and answer any questions.

[Speaker 33] (1:10:16 - 1:11:43)
Thank you, Chairman Lawson. Good morning for the record, Matt Crawford. I'm a planner with the Department of Planning and Development and I'm also a staff member for the Commission on Chicago Landmarks and that body has recommended to council that the John B.

Murphy Memorial be designated as a Chicago landmark. The building was built in 1926 as a home for the American College of Surgeons. These were surgeons that got together to develop improvements in surgical practice.

The American College of Surgeons is still headquartered in Chicago and it's a global organization. I mean, architecturally, the building speaks for itself. As you can see, it's a Renaissance Revival style building.

It's an extremely beautiful building and the interior is also fantastic. You can see the image of the auditorium. That has also been recommended as part of the protected features for the building.

Until very recently, the memorial was owned by the College of Surgeons and they maintained it extremely well. In 2022, the Driehaus Museum acquired the building and they have consented to landmark designation. They're undertaking a restoration and addition that's been approved by the Landmarks Commission.

They're here today and they're very happy to see this moving forward. The Murphy Memorial is in the 42nd Ward and Alderman Riley has indicated his support.

[Speaker 1] (1:11:44 - 1:11:52)
Thank you. Great. Thank you very much, Mr. Crawford. Alderman Riley, did you want to add anything on this landmark?

[Speaker 2] (1:11:53 - 1:12:28)
Yes, Chairman. Completed nearly a century ago, the Murphy Memorial is one of the finest historic buildings on the near north side, both on the exterior and interior. It was designed by Marshall and Fox, an architectural firm that shaped Chicago's lakefront in the early 20th century.

This building was constructed for the American College of Surgeons, an international professional organization founded in Chicago and still headquartered here. So, like staff and the department, I would strongly encourage an aye vote. Thank you.

Great.

[Speaker 1] (1:12:28 - 1:13:13)
Do I have any questions by committee members? Seeing none, all the women crews, moves do pass. All in favor, say aye.

All in favor, say aye. All opposed, say nay. Somebody's got to say aye, guys.

I know we're coming out of COVID and we're doing it a little different. Maybe I should have said that at the beginning. We're not taking your quorum from the roll call.

We are doing aye and nay. So, all the women crews, makes the motion do pass. All in favor, say aye.

All opposed, say nay. Figuring that sure the ayes have it, the item will be reported out. Thank you all very much.

Sorry, I should have been a little more clear that we're going the old way, which is still new for my colleagues. All right.

[Speaker 2] (1:13:18 - 1:13:40)
All right. Yes. Given that folks are at a competing press conference right now related to ShotSpotter, I think the upcoming topics on the agenda might be best for us to have more colleagues in the room, to hear Patrick Murphy.

Would it be okay, your pleasure, to take another item or two while folks I see no issue with that.

[Speaker 1] (1:13:40 - 1:13:52)
We have two other text amendments, one in the 34th ward, or the other in the 27th ward. We could hear those or I could move to map amendments. I know it's a busy day, so we want to accommodate everybody.

[Speaker 5] (1:13:54 - 1:13:56)
Chairman, I'm here for however I could be.

[Speaker 1] (1:13:56 - 1:15:11)
All right. All right. Then we will go, and then vice chair Burnett, you're good if we hear the sign ordinance as well.

All right. That's up first, actually. So, we'll start with that.

So, we're going to pass on the first item, 2023-0006208, and we will come back to that. We're going to hear document number 2024-0007801 in the 27th ward, introduced 22124. It's an amendment of the municipal code, section 12, I'm sorry, section 17-12-1005-G, regarding occupancy rates of principal tenants utilizing high-rise building signs.

The item has a substitute ordinance. You'll find a copy of the substitute as well as a memo prepared by zoning administrator Patrick Murphy in your packets. Alder Ciccio-Lopez makes a motion to accept the substitute.

All in favor say aye. Any opposed say nay. The opinion of the chair, the ayes have it.

The substitute is before us. We also have Alderman Rosa for purposes of forum. I'm sure if I did that.

All right. We have zoning administrator Patrick Murphy to enlighten us.

[Speaker 3] (1:15:11 - 1:17:37)
Thank you, Chairman. For the record, Patrick Murphy with the Department of Planning and Development. This ordinance is kind of the culmination of a couple of years worth of work by our department, specifically in conjunction with Rural Business Chicago, to look at some of the regulations that we currently have regarding high-rise signage and the ability for principal tenants to receive the authority to put a sign on the top of their building.

For the last 18 months or so, and especially coming out of COVID, we've seen a reduction in both the volume of square footage that tenants lease in the city, specifically downtown, and in the percentage that that represents in the buildings themselves, both of which are thresholds which currently exist at 350,000 square feet or 51% of the building. Starting last summer, working with Lisa and Robin, who are here from Rural Business Chicago, we worked on looking at the leases that have been entered into the buildings which qualify, so a building that could establish a sign legally at 150 feet above grade, and what the new lease structures have been as far as sizes and percentages of the buildings that they occupy. Of the 156 buildings that qualified within the city, generally speaking, it's going to be within the greater loop and downtown area, there are some on the far northwest side near O'Hare, but generally speaking, we're talking about downtown commercial buildings, 71 leases excluding ground floor retail space were looked at, and of those, nine were for spaces above 100,000 square feet, four were for spaces above 200,000 square feet, and two were for spaces above 250,000 square feet. Now, all of that is less than the 350,000 square foot threshold that we have today, and so the ordinance that's proposed takes a very conservative approach at dialing back some of that percentage, we're proposing it 250,000 square feet in the text that's before you, that represents then a reciprocal reduction in the amount of square footage that can be occupied in the building going from 51% to 36%. This still only allows one high-rise sign, save for a very specific exemption related to planned developments and headquarters, and it still relies on the same requirement that landlords dictate through negotiations with tenants who gets to be proposed as the principal tenant pursuant to these calculations.

[Speaker 1] (1:17:38 - 1:17:41)
Great, thank you, Mr. Murphy. Vice Chair Burnett, anything you wanted to add?

[Speaker 4] (1:17:42 - 1:18:49)
Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman. So, first of all, I want to thank Patrick Murphy and also World Business Chicago for working with me on this and giving me the opportunity to work with them on this. You know, as you know, the way industry is changing now, folks use less square footage in their offices now, a lot of corporations, because they don't have the big desk and big offices, you know, they have a whole bunch of tables and a whole bunch of people sitting in them, so they have, they get, actually get less square footage in order to make these corporations run, and at the same time, we have these landlords whom they negotiate with, they need the signage in order for them to move in the buildings, and with the loss of businesses moving out of the city, we want to give them an opportunity to move in the city and help these landlords to keep tenants in their buildings, so I think this is a good ordinance. I support it. I ask for the committee support also.

Thank you. Thank you, Vice Mayor Burnett.

[Speaker 1] (1:18:49 - 1:18:52)
I think I called you Vice Chair last time. Alvin Riley.

[Speaker 2] (1:18:54 - 1:20:03)
Thank you, Chairman, and to the ordinance, I am certainly, I think, one of the most sympathetic people here towards existing building orders in Chicago. I do wish that Alderman Conway and I had been contacted about this, as we represent a pretty sizable majority of the city's downtown skyline. You know, I have a pretty conservative view of these kinds of high-rise signs, but given the current climate and market conditions and occupancy rates and the struggle that our downtown landlords are facing right now, I'm willing to vote for this ordinance, despite the fact that I wasn't engaged as a legitimate stakeholder in the conversation, so, but for the current conditions and all the challenges facing the real estate community in Chicago, I would probably be inclined to vote against it, but again, these are folks who need our support right now, and we want to continue to be able to lure corporate headquarters to the downtown area, so I'll be voting in favor of it. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:20:03 - 1:20:49)
Thank you, Alderman. Any other members, guests, who want to speak on this? I'm seeing none.

Alderman Ramirez-Rosa makes the motion to pass. All in favor, say aye. Any opposed, say nay.

In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it, and this item is passed. Next up, we have text amendment O-2024-0008393, introduced by Alderman Conway for the amendment of Municipal Code Title 17, by modifying various sections regarding permit specifications and location restrictions for cannabis business establishments. Alderman Conway?

Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 5] (1:20:50 - 1:22:13)
So, in summary, what this does is it takes into account the unique issues that we face in downtown regarding density. There are a lot of things in the cannabis ordinance that make a lot of sense. For example, you can't put a dispensary within 500 feet of a school, and you can imagine you're an elementary school playground, that's a pretty good rule.

However, downtown, oftentimes our schools are located on floors four through seven of a building, in which case the 500-foot issue doesn't make sense. So, what this ordinance, this text amendment does is it allows us downtown flexibility for dispensaries at a time when downtown retail is very much hurting, and it also takes some authority back from the ZBA and gives it back to us here in Zoning Committee, because as you all know from your community meetings, it's us who really wear the vest for this when cannabis dispensaries become an issue. So, happy to speak more on this, but I will say this on this ordinance.

If you are for job creation downtown, if you are for additional revenue for this city, then you are for this ordinance. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:22:13 - 1:22:16)
Thank you, Alderman. Alderman Knudsen?

[Speaker 11] (1:22:17 - 1:22:22)
Chair, and can I direct questions at the sponsor just to get some clarifications on the record?

[Speaker 23] (1:22:22 - 1:22:22)
Sure.

[Speaker 1] (1:22:23 - 1:22:32)
Go ahead. Alderman Conroy? Yeah?

Oh, you're not on. Go ahead.

[Speaker 5] (1:22:33 - 1:23:09)
All right. The genesis of this ordinance was a previous ordinance of mine that made some changes, but then after that, an ordinance that Alderman Hopkins wrote was then substituted for mine. I am still listed as the main sponsor.

I do understand that Alderman Hopkins has stepped out for a second, so maybe before we are subjected to Alderman Knudsen's cross-examination, maybe if I had my co-counsel here, Mr. Alderman Hopkins, that may be helpful.

[Speaker 1] (1:23:10 - 1:23:16)
So, would you like to hold this item? Temporarily, yes.

[Speaker 5] (1:23:16 - 1:23:21)
Not beyond the length of this meeting, but perhaps do some map amendments and things first.

[Speaker 1] (1:23:21 - 1:23:36)
Yes, yes. All right. So, at the request of the sponsor, we will come back to this.

I can just say that, yes? All right. We're going to hold this.

We're going to go to the text amendments, and then we'll come back to the map amendments. We'll come back to text amendments when the room is a little more flush.

[Speaker 23] (1:23:46 - 1:23:47)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (1:23:51 - 1:26:04)
All right. We'll do signs. I should have done that already.

Next up, we have large signs over 100 square feet in area, 24 feet above grade. We will hear them all together. I will read the ward followed by the address and take a motion at the end.

In the third ward, 1414 South Wabash, two signs in the 13th ward located at 6417 South Cicero Avenue. One sign in the 23rd ward located at 3944 West 55th Street. Two signs in the 25th ward located at 2724 West Cermak Road.

One sign in the 25th ward located at 3059 West 26th Street. Three signs in the 27th ward located at 360 North Green Street. Two signs in the 28th ward, one located at 1101 South Canal and one located at 1520 West Harrison.

Two signs in the 32nd ward located at 2300 North Clybourne. One sign in the 32nd ward located at 1760 North Kingsbury. One sign in the 39th ward located at 5838 North Pulaski.

Three signs in the 42nd ward located at 555 North Michigan Avenue. One sign in the 42nd ward located at 679 North Michigan Avenue. One sign in the 45th ward located at 4730 West Irving Park Road.

And lastly, one sign in the 46th ward located at 4730 North Sheridan Road. If there's no questions by committee members, Alderman Ramirez makes a motion to pass. All in favor say aye.

All opposed say nay. Opinion of the chair, the ayes have it and these orders are passed. All right, we'll now move on to the map amendments in an effort to ensure the committee meeting runs as smoothly as possible.

We're grouped together according to witness and we heard in that order. All right, first item is the first ward. We're going to come back to that.

Top of page three, document number A8869 in the 35th ward. Ordinance referred to 22124. Common address is 2901 to 2909 North Milwaukee Avenue.

Change requests B22, neighborhood mixed-use district and C13, commercial neighborhood district to B31, community shopping district. Applicant is Alderman Ramirez Rosa.

[Speaker 9] (1:26:04 - 1:26:58)
Thank you so much. I ask the support of my colleagues to rezone a block of Milwaukee Avenue in the 35th ward. As part of our community-driven zoning and development process, we often engage in reviews of the underlining zoning along our commercial corridors.

And in this instance, working with local nonprofits, we identified a block where we felt that B3 would be more appropriate than B2. As you all know, B3 allows for additional uses and we feel that this B3 designation will be critical towards continuing to support the development and investment along this block. So we worked with our department planning development and our zoning administrator, Patrick Murphy, to prepare this ordinance to rezone this block of Milwaukee Avenue from B2 to B3.

And we do ask your support to accomplish our land use and zoning policy in the 35th ward. Thank you. Great.

[Speaker 1] (1:26:59 - 1:27:31)
Thank you. Any questions by committee members? Seeing none, all those bottom moves do pass.

All in favor, say aye. Any opposed, say nay. The opinion of the chair, the ayes have it.

We'll move forward. Thank you. We're going to go back to the bottom of page two, document number A8870 in the first ward.

Ordinance referred to 221-24. Common address is 2240 North Milwaukee Avenue. Change request is C15, Neighborhood Commercial District to C11, Neighborhood Commercial District.

We have Alderman LaSpada.

[Speaker 6] (1:27:32 - 1:28:25)
Thank you, Chair. So this is actually restoring the previous zoning from a lapsed Type 1 zoning change that occurred before I was in office. Being a lapsed Type 1 zoning, we would have to come back to this anyway for a development to take place on this spot.

I am not opposed to height, density, space, a space that's well served by transit. But restoring the zoning from the lapsed Type 1 allows us to simply restart that process. C1-1 is essentially the zoning for the majority of that stretch of Milwaukee Avenue.

So it's very contextual to the space. It's been posted. It's been in a newsletter.

We haven't had any negative feedback from the community on this, and I would hope for the committee's favorable consideration. Thank you, sir.

[Speaker 1] (1:28:25 - 1:29:31)
Great. Thank you, Alder. Any questions by committee members?

Seeing none, Alder Knudson moves do pass. All in favor, say aye. Any opposed, say nay.

Ayes have it. We'll report it out at Council tomorrow. All right.

Bottom of page 2 is item number 22327 in the 8th Ward. Ordinance referred, 1-2424. Common address is 1614 through 1906 East 95th Street.

Change request, M-1-1, Limited Manufacturing District and Commercial Business Plan Development, Number 484 to an Industrial Plan Development. This item was heard and passed by the Chicago Plan Commission, although the spotter makes a motion to incorporate all records and findings from that hearing. All in favor, please say aye.

All opposed, say nay. And the ayes have it, and the records are incorporated. We have with us Mariah Degrino on this matter.

[Speaker 19] (1:29:31 - 1:31:31)
Thank you. Again, my name is Mariah Degrino. I'm joined by Robert Buckner and Ninfa Buckner, both of the applicant, Flexol, Flexol Packaging Corp of Chicago, which is commonly known as Isaflex Packaging.

As the Chairman noted, this matter was considered at a public hearing before the Chicago Plan Commission last Thursday, and the Plan Commission recommended approval. Isaflex manufactures specialty plastic films and bags for various packaging needs. They are the largest privately owned film extruder in North America and operate seven facilities throughout the U.S., including one at 1650 East 95th Street. Isaflex has acquired the vacant parcel located east of its current facility and proposes to expand its existing operations by constructing a one-story addition and a one-story standalone building. The vacant parcel was designated as Plan Development 484 in 1989 to accommodate development of a retail commercial center. In 1989, it was rezoned from the M District to Plan Development.

That project was never built, and the property has continued to remain vacant. The application seeks to rezone the entire site to a unified M1-1 District, and then to establish an industrial PD designation. A key objective of the project is to create a new loading area that would accommodate truck maneuvers on-site.

Currently, truck maneuvers create traffic jams on 95th Street. The new loading area would allow for all of those maneuvers to be conducted on-site. The proposed development is consistent with the urban industrial character of the surrounding area.

New urban industrial uses would support the vitality of the existing industrial area, support the industrial job base, as well as supporting the overall vitality of the commercial amenities in and around the 95th Street corridor. Alderman Harris has delivered a letter of support, and I believe I saw her earlier here. She were here to speak in support as well, but we respectfully request your approval of this plan development and are available to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (1:31:32 - 1:31:51)
Great. Thank you, Mr. Greeno. We do have the support from Alderman Harris.

I know she's been in and out today. Are there any questions by committee members? Seeing none, Alderman Conway makes the motion do pass.

All in favor, say aye. Any opposed, say nay. Depending on the chair, the ayes have it.

The item will be reported out.

[Speaker 23] (1:31:51 - 1:31:51)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:31:53 - 1:32:33)
Next is the middle of page four, document number 22204 in the 27th Ward, ordinance referred 62123. Common address is 116 to 138 South Paulina Street. The change request, C13, Commercial Neighborhood District, to B35, Community Shopping District, and then to a residential business plan development.

This item was heard and passed by the Chicago Plan Commission. Alderman Hall makes a motion to incorporate all records and findings from that hearing. All in favor, please say aye.

Any opposed, say nay. Depending on the chair, the ayes have it. The records are incorporated, and we have Rich Clowder to present.

[Speaker 12] (1:32:33 - 1:34:05)
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee for the record. Rich Clowder, DLA Piper. As you noted, this was approved by the Plan Commission last Thursday unanimously.

The site's located on the northwest corner of Adams and Paulina in the West Loop and is currently vacant. Proposed development by City Church Fellowship consists of a new 1,500-seat auditorium and adjoining retail, cafe, administrative offices, multipurpose conference rooms, and youth programming and child care areas. A future phase that may consist of up to 76 residential units would be subject to future site plan approval.

With me today is a member of the Church and Governing Board, John Boska. This, as he would speak to, is a very important project for City Church. It's located in the 27th Ward, and it will allow them to continue their impressive outreach and ministry in that community and throughout the city.

We've worked closely with Alderman Burnett and various city agencies, including DPD, CTA, and others, and there is local community support for this project, as is their support from Alderman Burnett, from whom we have a letter of support. We're available for any questions, and thank you very much for your consideration.

[Speaker 1] (1:34:06 - 1:34:13)
Thank you, Mr. Clowder. We do have the support from Alderman Burnett. Mr. Boska, did you want to add anything on this one?

I know we heard from you earlier, too.

[Speaker 16] (1:34:13 - 1:34:15)
No, Rich covered it perfectly.

[Speaker 1] (1:34:15 - 1:34:19)
Great. Thank you. Any questions by committee members?

Alderman Espada?

[Speaker 6] (1:34:21 - 1:35:05)
Thank you, Chair. Only speaking on behalf of the Planned Commission meeting, folks should know it was genuinely and enthusiastically received by the Planned Commission, as we talked about then. Fascinating design, great layout, incorporates all of these community spaces that go far beyond just how the parishioners will use the space, because as we talked about, it really is the first transit-oriented new construction house of worship that I think we've seen in Chicago, and even just from that perspective, it was a fascinating project to get to review and approve and get to vote on here.

So I just want to share that. Thank you so much for bringing it forward and bringing it forward so thoughtfully. Thank you, Chair.

[Speaker 1] (1:35:06 - 1:35:07)
Great. Thank you. Alderman Conway?

[Speaker 5] (1:35:12 - 1:35:19)
Noting that this is actually kitty-corner to my ward and building a 1,500-seat auditorium, may I ask how much parking?

[Speaker 12] (1:35:21 - 1:35:23)
John, do you want to speak to that?

[Speaker 16] (1:35:24 - 1:36:42)
Sure. One of the reasons why we looked at this site and was directed to this site was because of the parking, because of all the parking that is there. Surrounding us is Lot D.

That's almost four acres that's parking. Around the United Center, there's approximately 50 acres of parking. Directly to the south of us is a lot that is owned by Rush Medical Center.

Again, there's over 500 parking spots there. Kitty-corner across the street from us is Teamster City. We reached out to every one of those entities, including the Illinois Medical District.

They are well aware of what we're doing in regards to the parking. We're in constant contact right now with United Center. We're aware of what their future holds for them, and also we're in alignment with working with them at the appropriate time.

Again, we're looking at probably 18-24 months to enter into any kind of parking arrangements.

[Speaker 5] (1:36:47 - 1:36:53)
I'll repeat my question because clearly it was not answered. How much parking is there for this 1,500-seat auditorium?

[Speaker 12] (1:36:54 - 1:37:12)
There is no on-site parking being provided. I was going to say it's a very rich transit-served area. There are lots of options for temporary parking available, as John just identified, and we don't believe that any parking is required on-site that can't be accommodated elsewhere.

[Speaker 5] (1:37:15 - 1:37:22)
Is there a discounted parking agreement with the United Center or with any of the other entities? Let's ask about the United Center first.

[Speaker 12] (1:37:23 - 1:37:46)
We are in discussions with multiple stakeholders in the neighborhood, Alderman. The project has not yet broken ground yet, and it's a two- to three-year construction project, so it would be premature to enter into firm agreements with them at this point, but we are very confident that there are lots of options in the neighborhood to provide for the capacity that's required by the church and its various programming.

[Speaker 5] (1:37:47 - 1:37:51)
Is what community groups were consulted with regard to this?

[Speaker 16] (1:37:54 - 1:38:02)
The alderman held the public meeting. It was with him, as well as we reached out to WCA.

[Speaker 5] (1:38:04 - 1:38:10)
Was the neighbors of West Loop consulted about this arrangement?

[Speaker 16] (1:38:11 - 1:38:12)
I'm unaware of that.

[Speaker 5] (1:38:13 - 1:38:18)
I don't know. I understand the Chamber of Commerce is, of course, behind this, but I didn't know if any of the residential groups were consulted.

[Speaker 1] (1:38:21 - 1:38:34)
We've been joined by Vice Mayor Burnett, as well. I apologize. We started on the map amendments.

If you want to add, I know Alderman Conway has some questions about parking. Alderman Spada, do you want a point of information before we go to them?

[Speaker 6] (1:38:37 - 1:39:16)
Thank you so much, Chair. I want to speak into this because we did talk— Do you have a point of information? You've already asked your question.

I discussed this at the plan commission. It's worth looking back on. The video is probably there.

There is so much access to public transit. You and your parishioners actually talked, gave public testimony about why this space works for your congregation as a transit-oriented development. Any church in this city built before 1920, guess what?

It doesn't have a parking lot. We've been doing church and worship as transit-oriented, so to speak, for decades now.

[Speaker 1] (1:39:16 - 1:39:23)
Thank you. I appreciate the information there. Vice Mayor Burnett, did you want to add anything on this one?

[Speaker 4] (1:39:24 - 1:40:37)
Sure. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We did have a community meeting with the community.

There were residents from all over the area. The developers sent out the notices. There was concern about parking.

One of the things that the planning department worked with the developer on is to make sure that they had some parking, which in that area is surrounded by a sea of parking. In that area, whether it be parking from the United Center, that's not used all the time, or parking from the unions, that's not used all the time, and or parking from Rush Hospital, that's not used all the time. So there are several opportunities for parking in this area.

This church, quite honestly, has been actually holding services on the lot, right? Periodically, they have not holding services, but periodically, they have an event on the lot, and everything works out just fine. I support this from the community meeting.

The majority of people in the community meeting support it. I ask for your support. Great.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:40:38 - 1:40:50)
I certainly know there's always creative parking arrangements with churches in my neighborhood as well, because they have to be, because I think there's always going to be a need, too. Any other questions by committee members? Sorry?

[Speaker 5] (1:40:50 - 1:41:23)
If I could just say one thing. I understand we're comparing to traditional churches, but this is a 1,500-seat auditorium, so it's a little bit different situation. So I will obviously have great respect for everybody involved here.

I will begrudgingly support this, but I just hope that the parking situation, as the development continues, that will be considered and addressed with regard to the surrounding residents. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:41:23 - 1:42:03)
Thank you, Alderman Conway. Anyone else have questions on this? Seeing none, Alderman Mosley moves due pass.

All in favor, please say aye. Any opposed, say nay. Meeting the chair, the ayes have it, and we report it out.

Bottom of page four is document number 22248 in the 27th Ward. Ordinance referred, 9-14-23. Common address is 370 North Carpenter.

Change request is M-23, Light Industry District, to D-X-7, Downtown Mixed-Use District, then to a Residential Business Plan Development. We have Rich Clowder. Hold on.

[Speaker 12] (1:42:04 - 1:42:11)
I was just going to ask for a motion to be approved, incorporating the record of last week's plan commissioned into the record here today.

[Speaker 1] (1:42:11 - 1:42:22)
Alderman Conway moves to incorporate the records and findings from that hearing. All in favor, say aye. Any opposed, say nay.

Meeting the chair, the ayes have it, and the records are incorporated.

[Speaker 12] (1:42:23 - 1:43:55)
Thank you again for the record, Rich Clowder from DLA Piper. Our client is the applicant, the applicant is 370 North Carpenter, LLC. That is a single purpose entity controlled by Sterling Bay.

Fred Kroll from Sterling Bay is here with me today. The property is located on Carpenter Street and bounded by West Kinsey Street, North Aberdeen Street, and the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul, and Pacific Railroad. As you noted, the subject property is currently zoned M-2-3 Light Industry District, and the applicant seeks in this application to rezone the property first to the D-X-7 District and then to establish a Residential Business Plan Development, which will allow for the development of a 349-foot residential building comprising 390 residential units and about 6,700 square feet of retail.

The project will also create approximately 78 ARO units. The overall FAR will be 11.2, and the property lies within the Kinsey Industrial Corridor. That means that there will be contributions made both to the Industrial Corridor Conversion Fund and also to the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund in the approximate amount of $3 million.

As is the case with every project in the 27th Ward, it received robust community input. We did have several community meetings over the course of many months with local stakeholders, including WCA and NOWL, as well as a community-wide meeting hosted by Alderman Burnett. We worked extensively with various city departments to improve the overall design of the building, and we hereby request that this body recommend approval to the full city council and of course are available for any questions, should you have any.

Thank you.

[Speaker 4] (1:43:55 - 1:44:17)
Thank you. Vice Mayor Burnett? Sure.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As the Councilor said, we did have a community meeting. They did go before the community organizations in that area.

They all gave their approval. We asked for the committee's support also. Thank you.

Great. Thank you, Vice Mayor. Any questions by committee members?

[Speaker 1] (1:44:19 - 1:44:54)
Seeing none, Alderman Sitio Lopez moves due pass as revised. All in favor, please say aye. Any opposed, say nay.

In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it, the records are incorporated. Next is the top of page 5, document number 22318 in the 27th Ward. Ordinance referred 121323.

Common address is 400 North Elizabeth Street. Change request, plan development number 1528 to DX7 Downtown Mixed Use District, then to a residential business plan development. We have Rich Clowder.

[Speaker 12] (1:44:54 - 1:45:05)
Yes, and again, I would like, as a preliminary matter, if I could to propose that you adopt a motion incorporating last week's Plan Commission hearing into the record here today.

[Speaker 1] (1:45:05 - 1:45:17)
Thank you. Alderman LaSpada makes the motion to incorporate all records and findings from that hearing. All in favor, say aye.

Any opposed, say nay. In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it, the records are incorporated.

[Speaker 12] (1:45:17 - 1:46:57)
Thanks. The latest 27th Ward project, of course, is 400 North Elizabeth. The applicant is 400 North Elizabeth Land, LLC.

The property is located, as you can see, at the northeast corner of Ogden and Kinsey. As you noted, we proposed to amend PD 1528, which was approved in 2021, and at that time authorized the development of a life sciences building on the subject property. That project proved infeasible in the current market, and so our request today is to rezone the PD's underlying zoning district, the DX7 district, and to amend the PD to allow the development of a 380-foot building and a 360-foot building, which together comprise 724 residential units and 1,500 square feet of retail.

The proposal includes approximately 29,000 square feet of public open space, including a pedestrian walkway along Kinsey, retail seating, lawn space, and an internal driveway. The project will create approximately 146 on-site ARO units, and as was the case in the prior project, in addition to contributing to the Kinsey Industrial Conversion Fund and the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund, the project will also contribute an additional $600,000 to a traffic mitigation and neighborhood beautification fund to underwrite traffic equipment upgrades and streetscape improvements. Again, this project received robust community input and support with many meetings with neighborhood stakeholders and city agencies, including CDOT, with respect especially to the Traffic Mitigation Fund, and DOH with respect to the project's development of affordable housing in the FMID, or Foot and Market Innovation District.

We're available for any questions. Thank you for your consideration. We ask do pass.

[Speaker 4] (1:46:58 - 1:47:59)
Great. Thank you. Vice Mayor Burnett?

Sure. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As the Councilor said, they met with several community organizations.

We also had a couple of community meetings for which planning was there. We had about eight community meetings. I have to hand it to the community.

They negotiated on a lot of amenities for the neighborhood in reference to this. I don't know if you all remember, this was supposed to be a life science building years ago. After COVID, it didn't happen.

What happened now is several contractors got together and a developer, some of them are minority contractors, put in their money together and came up with this project. I think this is a great design. The majority of people in the meeting supported.

Of course, there's always some folks who don't support it. I ask for the committee's support. Thank you.

Thank you, Vice Mayor. Alderman LaSpada?

[Speaker 6] (1:47:59 - 1:49:45)
Thank you so much, Chair. If I had a better arm, I could in fact throw a stone and hit the first ward, hit this development from the first ward. It always feels worth being thoughtfully engaged on it, particularly as a member of the Planning Commission.

I will say, more than just comes across in these renderings, again, for interested committee members, worth going back to the full presentation available on the Planning Commission's website because it tells you a lot about this development. We talk a lot about publicly accessible green space, but there's a real utility in the green space and the pedestrian features of this development. I know people brought up fire department firefighting concerns with this site.

Folks who are concerned should know that the fire department did in fact write off on this, that the infrastructure is designed so that you can effectively fight a fire from this space. There's concerns with how it intersects from a pedestrian level, but there's a lot of thoughtfulness there as well in terms of the design, in terms of the commercial spaces here. And I know there's concern about what happens when you bring more intensity of use from a transportation perspective.

CDOT's a partner on that. KLOA is a partner on that. Yes, there's the transportation fund that's mentioned, but also, hey, we're in a TIF district.

So if it does come down to that we need more intensive traffic reorientation there, the funding is there to do that work. Based off of that, based off of hearing from my residents, the presentation at the Planning Commission, that's what makes me feel comfortable with even such an intensive development across the street from the first board. Thank you, Chair.

[Speaker 1] (1:49:45 - 1:50:32)
Great. Thank you, Alderman. Any other questions by committee members?

Seeing none, Alderman Knudtson moves do pass as revised. All in favor say aye. Any opposed say nay.

The Chair, the ayes have it. And we'll report it out next week or tomorrow. Excuse me.

Middle of page 5 is docket number 22359 in the 27th ward. Ordinance referred is 21524. Common address is 3601-3625 West Chicago Avenue, 751-757 North Monticello Avenue, and 740-756 North Central Park Avenue.

Change request is B3-2 Community Shopping District to B3-3 Community Shopping District. We have Mariah Degrino and Rich Clowder.

[Speaker 19] (1:50:33 - 1:52:11)
Thank you. I'm joined by, as you mentioned, my name is Mariah Degrino with DLA Piper. I'm joined by Rich Clowder, my colleague.

We represent the AVSW LLC, which is a joint venture between KMW Communities and Preservation of Affordable Housing, also known as POA. I'm joined today by Julie DeGrasse of POA and Bill Williams of KMW. And I believe this matter seeks to rezone the property from the B3-2 Community Shopping District to the B3-3 Community Shopping District to facilitate development of a mixed-use development containing 52 affordable housing units and ground floor commercial retail and community space.

Specifically, the ground floor will include the Westside Headquarters for Neighborhood Housing Services, a longstanding community institution that offers lending, education, and housing preservation services. This property is currently owned by NHS and the City of Chicago. The project was selected for funding and support under the City's Invest Southwest initiative.

On May 8th, Transportation Committee recommended approval of right-of-way adjustments to relocate an alley for the project. And on May 13th, the Finance Committee recommended approval of the issuance of multifamily housing bonds, also in support of the project. The proposed rezoning will promote development of a pedestrian-oriented affordable housing development that will revitalize an important corridor on Chicago's Westside.

Alderman Burnett has submitted a letter of support, and I request your approval and are here to answer any questions. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:52:12 - 1:52:13)
Great. Thank you so much, Mr. Greenough.

[Speaker 4] (1:52:13 - 1:52:51)
Vice Mayor Burnett, anything else you wanted to add? So, Mr. Chairman, this is actually one of the Invest Southwest projects that was initiated a couple of years ago. This is a partnership between POA and some African-American developers.

There are several African-American developers involved. The community, this has really been worked on with the neighborhood, you know, all the way from the ground up. The community supports it 100%.

I support it 100%. I appreciate the committee's support. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:52:51 - 1:53:12)
Thank you, Vice Mayor. Sergeant-at-Arms, there's an individual who's shouting out pretty regularly. I'd ask that to remain quiet at all times.

Any other questions by committee members? Seeing none, Alderman Mosley, moves do pass. All in favor, please say aye.

Any opposed, say nay. The opinion of the chair, the ayes have it, and it will be reported out at tomorrow's meeting.

[Speaker 19] (1:53:12 - 1:53:13)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:53:13 - 1:53:40)
Thank you. All right, we're going to finish up with DLA Piper, and then we're going to go back to text amendments. That is kosher with my committee members.

Yes, great. Bottom of page 5, document number 22408 in the 42nd ward, ordinance referred 41724. The change request is business plan development number 1472 to DX5 downtown mixed-use district.

This request is also incorporating variations.

[Speaker 12] (1:53:40 - 1:54:25)
Yes, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. The applicant in this matter is RPO 225 West Chicago LLC. The site is located at the southeast corner Chicago and Franklin.

This project involved a PD that was approved in 2020 to allow for the construction of an office building, which never moved forward given today's market conditions. Our request here is simply to sunset the PD back to the former DX5 district so that the site can be marketed for sale and developed in accordance with that district's regulations. Project team did discuss this request with Alderman Riley, who has submitted a letter confirming that he does not object to this request.

Of course, any future development of the site will be discussed with his office per the typical protocol in the 42nd ward. We'd ask for your favorable consideration.

[Speaker 1] (1:54:26 - 1:54:28)
Great, thank you, Mr. Clowder. Alderman Riley?

[Speaker 2] (1:54:30 - 1:54:36)
Thank you, Chairman. Just as was stated by Council, I support the amendment and appreciate my colleagues' support as well.

[Speaker 1] (1:54:37 - 1:54:49)
Great, thank you. Any questions by committee members? Seeing none, Vice Mayor Burnett, moves do pass.

All in favor, say aye. All opposed, say nay. Seeing the Chair, the ayes have it, and this will be reported out tomorrow.

[Speaker 12] (1:54:49 - 1:54:50)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (1:54:50 - 1:55:43)
Thank you, Rich, Mariah, Team DLF. All right, now we're going to go back to page one. The document number that we had previously read in and held is the third item.

Document number O-2024-0008393 introduced from the 34th ward with the second ward on 3-20-24. Amendment of the Municipal Code, Title 17-8398. Did I read it wrong?

Document number O-2024-0008398 in the 34th ward. Modifying various sections regarding permit specification and location restrictions for cannabis business establishments. Alderman Conway or Hopkins?

[Speaker 5] (1:55:47 - 1:56:16)
I doubt my remarks from earlier, and then also mentioned that, you know, as I said, it's going to allow us some real flexibility for dispensaries downtown where we have unique issues, and we'll bring that from the ZBA to here in Zoning Committee. I would also add that I have worked with not only Alders, Hopkins, Riley, and Burnett on this and getting this, but also with the Black Caucus to come to this compromise legislation. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:56:16 - 1:56:18)
All right. Thank you, Alderman. Alderman Hopkins?

[Speaker 25] (1:56:20 - 1:57:24)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm in full support of this ordinance. I commend my colleague from the 34th ward for his leadership on this issue.

As he mentioned, this will provide much-needed flexibility. I would suggest that there's no place other than the downtown district where flexibility is needed as significantly as it is right now when it comes to the citing decisions for cannabis dispensaries. It's literally a block-by-block basis.

What might be appropriate on one corner is inappropriate on another corner, and no one is in a better position to make such determinations than the alderman with full community review, as this ordinance also calls for. So I'm in full support of it. It's the right thing to do to have both that flexibility and that oversight that's necessary to be the steward of what is inherently a controversial public process.

They're never unanimous. There's always support and opposition for licensed dispensaries in the downtown district, and we as aldermen need all the help we can get trying to navigate those sometimes choppy waters. So I'm in full support of this, and I urge an aye vote.

All right. Thank you. Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 4] (1:57:24 - 1:57:25)
Vice Mayor Burnett?

[Speaker 23] (1:57:25 - 1:57:25)
Yeah.

[Speaker 4] (1:57:26 - 1:58:01)
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I concur with my colleague. I commend Alderman Conway for this ordinance.

I think it's long overdue that the aldermen have more input in this. Downtown is a unique area. We have a lot of social equity folks getting licenses now, and they've always wanted the opportunity to be downtown also.

So I support this 100 percent, and I ask for the committee's support also. Great. Thank you, Vice Mayor.

Alderman Espada, followed by Knutson.

[Speaker 6] (1:58:02 - 1:58:30)
Thank you, Chair. Not that it impacts the First Ward, because it doesn't, clearly by the impact of wards, but just because I want to understand what I'm voting on. It reads that moving forward, the only essentially of right zoning for dispensary downtown or these various cannabis businesses would be a PD.

Otherwise, you would need a type one zoning change. Is that accurate?

[Speaker 1] (1:58:31 - 1:58:39)
I would defer to the sponsors on that. Our zoning administrator has stepped out, Alderman Conway.

[Speaker 5] (1:58:39 - 1:58:46)
Yeah, no. So right now, it is not as bright. It'd have to be a type one to go forward on this.

[Speaker 6] (1:58:48 - 1:59:10)
I feel like I must be reading. So it seems like we're saying they must be reviewed and approved in accordance with the type one zoning amendment procedures instead of the special use procedure. So I just want to understand, are we moving from special use to type one or from type one to special use?

Can you clarify?

[Speaker 5] (1:59:10 - 1:59:12)
Yeah, we're going from special use to type one.

[Speaker 1] (1:59:12 - 1:59:19)
Right. In the downtown area, the process would be either type one or in a plan development process just for that specific geography.

[Speaker 11] (1:59:20 - 1:59:21)
Okay. Thank you, Chair.

[Speaker 1] (1:59:21 - 1:59:22)
Thank you.

[Speaker 11] (1:59:24 - 2:01:53)
Thank you, Chair. And I'll just circle back. I'll have a few points.

Question for Alderman Conway. The first I just want to frame, at least for the record, an argument that we can achieve the policy goal here while not cutting out the independent board piece of the Zoning Board of Appeals. So first point on that, I strongly agree that the 500 feet rule in the downtown area is arbitrary compared to how it impacts communities with less density.

The ZBA has seen situations where dispensaries can't move in within 500 feet, but it covers just a lot of people and could be a huge business help to get more in there. And I'll also second that on a ZBA point that with this argument, I promise I'm pro-dispensary. I'm actually one of the few people in this city with a record of approving many dispensaries as chair of the Zoning Board of Appeals.

I don't think during my tenure we actually ever turned a single one down. So that gets me to the point that removing ZBA from this process indirectly leads to a slippery slope towards aldermanic prerogative. When these dispensary applications come to the Zoning Board of Appeals, there's far more pressure on the applicants to engage with the community more than what's required by the law.

And that community engagement leads to really thorough plans of operation. Thorough in the sense that when the community shows up every step of the way, including at ZBA, which there's a pattern of them showing up far more at than this committee on zoning, it leads to healthier development. You nip issues in the butt ahead of time because you've had the community at the table the whole time.

So to go to that, and I'll say the way ZBA weighs these issues, it's a five-person independent board. We saw one appointee come in front of us today. He's a member of the community, but he's also an expert and it's quasi-judicial.

They make a decision at the end. And I want to point out that alderman can be involved and have to be involved throughout that process. So on that, just a couple of questions so that we can just get some of the greater intent out of here.

I'll direct them to Alderman Conway. Why not keep these dispensaries as special uses within ZBA while allowing them to be built within 500 feet in downtown areas?

[Speaker 5] (2:01:54 - 2:02:40)
Well, one thing about the uniqueness of downtown is that this will allow us to consider factors beyond the ZBA. And I would also know that, frankly, I think that I know my ward better than the ZBA does. And in these, and I think aldermanic control of this specifically sensitive process is important, especially in a very dense ward.

I have the smallest board in the city. If it's not, and I believe alderman Hopkins has the second smallest board in the city. And as a result of that, I think that's why that shows the unique issues that we face.

And similarly, the community process here is not going to be disrupted. I mean, that is in the statute and will certainly, certainly continue.

[Speaker 11] (2:02:42 - 2:03:01)
Okay. So as a secondary question on that, because I want to pick up something that, you know, you know, your ward better than the ZBA does. I wouldn't argue against that, but I would say that statement turns the clock back on aldermanic prerogative to where we were a decade ago.

Can you address in light of this, how you feel about aldermanic prerogative?

[Speaker 1] (2:03:03 - 2:03:06)
I'm not sure that's the right question here. Okay.

[Speaker 11] (2:03:06 - 2:03:08)
Let me, let me rephrase. Let me rephrase.

[Speaker 1] (2:03:08 - 2:03:15)
I mean, we're, we're, this is, I saw no quasi judicial process, right. But right on the merits on the ordinance, if you could.

[Speaker 11] (2:03:15 - 2:03:37)
Okay. I'll rephrase it. In light of this ordinance, which takes a piece of a special use out of an independent quasi judicial board, can you not foresee a situation where this is a slippery slope and we spot zone things out of the ZBA because this strong precedent has been set?

[Speaker 5] (2:03:40 - 2:04:15)
Not having the light really gets me. You know, it, it, I, I would simply say to that, that I would point again to the unique factors of, of downtown, but also note that, that as alders, we, we are uniquely responsive to our constituents. And the fact that, that, that the cannabis dispensaries are such a sensitive process and it really can change block by block, I think allows us, especially in the, in these very dense wards, means that we should have this additional involvement in the process.

[Speaker 1] (2:04:16 - 2:04:17)
Anything else alderman?

[Speaker 11] (2:04:18 - 2:05:46)
I would say, you know, I agree that aldermen do know their, their wards best. And that's why aldermen present at ZBA pretty consistently. I would argue and give the experience that as chair of the ZBA, we heard of many special use situations that come up in different wards, that it's not dispensaries, but it's hair salons.

There's wards where special uses like nails and hair salons are an issue and aldermen show up every single meeting to discuss them, but not once has there been an ordinance proposed to take hair, hair salons and nail salons out of special use and put it into the hands of the alderman. I find that the balance between a real compromise ordinance that would allow these to be built within 500 feet of each other while going to ZBA is the perfect balance between keeping the community front and center while promoting business use for dispensaries. So with that, you know, I'll end it.

This is my, my really pitch for independent boards in our city. I think they're very important. Like I said, we just saw a great app or a great appointee and Adrian Soto, who has a resume that really understands development and by no means does ZBA take all influence away from aldermen.

It's another check and balance that again, leads to better operating businesses when they come in. So thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:05:47 - 2:05:49)
Thank you. Alderman Sancho Lopez.

[Speaker 41] (2:05:50 - 2:06:13)
Thank you chairman. I have a clarifying question in terms of the process. Will these new ordinance also have a mandatory public meeting for cannabis?

I know that that's, I share some of the concerns by Alderman Knudsen in terms of the process. So just a clarifying question around making sure that we have a mandatory public meeting.

[Speaker 1] (2:06:14 - 2:06:15)
Yes. Yes. That is correct.

[Speaker 41] (2:06:16 - 2:06:47)
All right. And then I am just glad that, you know, we know that making sure that we have a Zoning Board of Appeals that is fully staffed, right. I think that's one of the, one of the things I'm glad that we're fulfilling that.

And I just want to make sure that, you know, I know based on the ordinance here, they are, they are, the words are affected are the second ward, 27, 28, 34, and 42nd ward. So for the record, all Aldermen seem to be in support of the ordinance, correct? The affected area.

[Speaker 1] (2:06:47 - 2:06:53)
I would let them speak for themselves, but certainly those present would have indicated support. Yes.

[Speaker 41] (2:06:54 - 2:07:02)
Okay. Yeah. Those are all my questions for the record.

Thank you.

[Speaker 2] (2:07:02 - 2:09:24)
Alderman Reilly. Thank you chairman. This is not an ordinance I'm a sponsor of, but after listening to the debate between my two colleagues from the 43rd and 34th ward, I wanted to just share a little bit of perspective as someone who's had a number of cannabis dispensaries proposed in my ward, the 42nd ward.

You know, when it comes to vetting these things properly and administering the required community process and, you know, negotiating a responsible plan of operation, if it is the will of the community to have a cannabis dispensary in their neighborhood, I think any older person who is doing his or her job properly is going to make sure that community process is well executed, that we hear from all stakeholders and that a plan is developed that reflects the feedback we received from our constituents.

I'm not concerned about that being to the disadvantage of the community one bit. However, my experience on the council here over the last 17 years is that while it may be well intended, the ZBA board often gets it wrong and makes decisions that are completely out of whack with the sentiment of the local community whom all of us are duly elected to represent and give voice to. And so, I'm not suggesting we do away with the ZBA.

I agree with my colleague, Alderman Knudson, that there's an important role for it for all sorts of matters. But with this particular issue, I don't believe that it should fall within their jurisdiction. And I'll remind my colleagues that the ZBA's jurisdiction has always been determined by this body, the elected Chicago City Council.

And so, as someone who's seen the ZBA get it wrong with cannabis applications in the 42nd Ward and having been bit by that process a couple of times, although I'm not passionate about this ordinance, I'll be voting in favor of it so that we can make sure that these decisions are more accountable to the folks who live and vote in our wards. So, thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:09:24 - 2:09:26)
Thank you. Alderman Rosa?

[Speaker 9] (2:09:27 - 2:10:47)
Thank you so much. I think that in my nine years now as Alderman, I've seen many times that residents do not understand the Zoning Board of Appeals. We explain it over and over again, but there's a perception in the City of Chicago that we as Aldermen have full control over everything that happens in our ward.

And obviously, I see some of my colleagues here laughing. We know that that is not the case. There are many things that do not involve our offices that we do not have authority over.

But when it comes to cannabis, I believe that our residents do believe that we should have a real say over whether or not these businesses will be opening up in our community. You know, generally when there is something that requires a special use permit, I do not host a community meeting because ultimately it is up to the ZBA to make that determination. But when cannabis dispensaries have come forward, I have hosted a community meeting because I know that my residents expect for my office and for myself as their elected representative to be very much involved in that decision-making process.

So I want to thank my colleague and my seatmate, Alderman Conway, for bringing forward this text amendment. I think that it makes a lot of sense, and I hope that we can support this today in committee and support it as a council so that we can ensure that our community's interests are represented when it comes to permitting these types of businesses in our neighborhoods. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:10:47 - 2:10:49)
Thank you, Alderman. Alderman Cruz.

[Speaker 15] (2:10:50 - 2:11:23)
Sorry, Chairman. I was a little late because I was in another committee, but I have a just general question, and I think this was explained. So again, pardon me, because I was in another committee.

But I just want to know the reasoning why changing it from a special use procedure to a type one zoning and taking that, you know, a special use and just, you know, making an automatic decision. So I just want to hear from my colleague.

[Speaker 5] (2:11:24 - 2:12:13)
Alderman Conway. Yes, please. Have some respect here.

Yes, Alderman. Mr. Chairman. No, I would simply say that this will allow us...

Downtown is a unique animal because it is so dense. And one of the issues that we've often faced is that we can't put a dispensary within 500 feet of a school. In 90% of Chicago, that makes a lot of sense.

You don't want a dispensary right by the elementary school playground. But in my ward and a lot of these, the schools tend to be like on floors four through seven of a building. So this will allow for that flexibility for dispensaries to happen and will allow us to be able to consider factors beyond that of the ZBA while not disrupting the community process.

[Speaker 1] (2:12:17 - 2:13:50)
Great. Thank you. Any other questions or anything else by committee members?

Seeing none, can I get a motion? Do pass. Alderman Conway moves.

All in favor, please say aye. Any opposed say nay. In the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it.

We record it out at tomorrow's council meeting. If you want to be recorded as no, come see staff. All right.

Now we are going to take the two MLA amendments that we had previously deferred. I'm going to read them both in. What I'm going to do is I'm going to ask our zoning administrator to give us a brief overview.

Then I'm going to turn it over to the two sponsors that we have. So first up is document number 02023-0006208 introduced by the fourth ward on 12-13-23. Amendment to municipal code section 17-4-0404 regarding MLA reduction for downtown floor area bonus.

Also is document number 02024-0008948 introduced by the 42nd ward alderman introduced 4-17-24 and amendment to the municipal code section 17-4-0404 modifying limitation on minimum lot area reduction to exclude buildings in lawful existence for 20 years in district with dash six designation 16 designations and granted no previous floor area bonus. Zoning administrator Patrick Murphy enlighten us a bit.

[Speaker 3] (2:13:51 - 2:15:32)
Good afternoon. Thank you. Patrick Murphy from the department of planning and development.

When the current bonus system was created in 2016 there were a series of bonus calculations related to additional floor area that were applied to the various downtown zoning districts. In the dash 16 zoning district an uncapped ability to provide bonus floor area was allowed. There was no corresponding uncapped ability related to minimum lot area or density.

At the time there were no projects that had sought that degree of floor I'm sorry MLA increase and since that time there have only been two non-residential the Bank of America and BMO office buildings that have sought dash 16 with the to utilize the uncapped floor area. Fast forward to the two proposals that are before you today. The difference is that in new buildings or existing there would be an ability to have a commensurate reduction in your density allow I'm sorry your MLA so increasing your density to correspond to the floor area increase.

All of our other discussions related to MLA calculations and floor area in the other bonus districts were to provide an opportunity for additional floor area to be utilized in a building and for that space to be filled with additional dwelling units as opposed to just larger units. That's what the one ordinance does. The second ordinance the one from Alderman Riley takes that same approach and applies it only to existing buildings that have not previously taken advantage of a density bonus program.

[Speaker 1] (2:15:33 - 2:15:40)
So those are the two distinctions. Great thank you as an administrator. I do want to allow the two sponsors a moment if they so choose Alderman Robinson.

[Speaker 14] (2:15:43 - 2:18:18)
Thank you chairman for allowing me this opportunity. This ordinance was drafted by DPD specifically Deputy Commissioner Patrick Murphy who we just heard from and is supported by the mayor to truly get it one of our largest issues which is affordable housing. And I believe to create an opportunity that's life-changing for our constituents to be able to live in the best parts of the city of Chicago.

Today colleagues I'm asking for you to support I'm asking for your support about a change I'm proposing on zoning rules. Right now a developer can increase the amount of building space floor area ratio which is which is also abbreviated the FAR and reduce the minimum lot area MLA needed for each unit but only up to 30 percent. This means fewer homes can be built on a piece of land which limits the number of affordable homes in downtown district developments.

My proposal would allow developers to reduce the MLA even more but only in special dash 16 districts which are rare and won't cause too much crowding. Here's why this is good for the city. More homes and jobs while allowing more units to be built on a piece of land this change can make some projects possible that otherwise wouldn't be.

I believe personally that we unfortunately have to pass up many development opportunities because they don't pencil out. This means more homes more construction jobs which is needed and more real estate taxes for our city. Number two more affordable quality housing in great areas in the city of Chicago which are our downtown districts.

Any new construction using this rule will have to follow affordable housing requirements and involve local leaders and the community in planning. This means we'll get more affordable housing wherever the projects happen and more community involvement. In simple terms this change helps us build more homes including affordable ones without making our city too crowded.

In addition again to creating much needed jobs. Mr. Chairman thank you for the opportunity.

[Speaker 1] (2:18:19 - 2:18:21)
Thank you Alderman. Alderman Riley did you want to add?

[Speaker 2] (2:18:22 - 2:24:12)
Yes chairman thank you and I would I'd like to kind of explain a couple of the key differences between my colleagues proposal and mine. They're both frankly aimed at attracting more investment to the central business district and with that affordable housing units. But there is a very key distinction I think it's one that my colleagues need to very strongly consider before passing one or the other of these ordinances.

In the downtown the D districts we have we already allow for a tremendous amount of density and development rights. In fact if you look in the zoning code there is no limit on the amount of FAR you can purchase to add to the highest zoning classification the city of DX16. And when you do that that money is deposited into the neighborhood opportunity fund which historically has been used to invest in good projects that could help transform communities predominantly on the south and west sides.

But I want to make it really clear that that any new development any new PD in the central business district in the D district will already be required to provide 20 percent ARO that's per the existing zoning code. So my colleagues proposal is not required to promote that activity. But I want to talk about the folks who've made very significant and risky at times investment in the downtown core over the last many years and who own or developed existing buildings that are here today.

And I can tell you that the Johnson administration like the Lightfoot administration and the Emanuel administration before them understands that we are having an issue a transformation of the central business district from what was once a vibrant and healthy office market to large buildings existing buildings with massive mortgages many of them underwater that are sorely underutilized and are suffering from record vacancy rates.

And it's such a priority for this administration to address that need the need of existing buildings that we are pressing forward with the LaSalle street reimagined project to transform many of these obsolete commercial bank buildings into affordable units for working families to occupy downtown. And so by offering up what is essentially a regulatory handout to prospective real estate developers who might consider a project in the central business district. I think it's more important that we protect the existing office buildings that are currently struggling today.

There are plenty of other incentives that exist for wealthy developers to come downtown and develop affordable units in the central business district. But to to allow for my colleagues ordinance to move forward is to do so at the detriment of the many hundreds of buildings downtown that are already struggling with tenancy. So instead we have a compromise measure before you that some of several of my colleagues have proposed that would apply this benefit only to existing buildings.

And so really that is truly the choice between these two ordinances. I applaud my colleague for wanting to promote economic development and real estate growth downtown. That's been my mission for 17 years as alderman.

But I think it's important for my colleagues to know that there is not broad consensus among the aldermen who represent these d districts in the central business district including chairwoman Dow, myself and alderman Conway. And so I would ask that we consider holding this in committee to allow for further dialogue to see if there's some reasonable compromise to be achieved. But if we are to proceed with alderman Robinson's ordinance and approve that today we're blowing a big hole in the zoning code as it applies to the central business district and that will have an impact on future development and on the future of existing buildings in Chicago as we know it.

And so I also just wanted to mention that we heard earlier during public comment from Preservation Chicago the city's leading preservation and landmark advocate that they support my proposal to provide relief for existing buildings and historic buildings. And we also heard from members of the development community that agreed. And although he had hoped being called during public comment I was given a statement from Richard Clowder who is a partner at DLA Piper, a notable zoning firm here in town that we all see in this committee on a regular basis.

I'm not going to read it into committee but I would like to submit this chairman as an exhibit. The bottom line is that he describes a property that exists in the city now an existing building that would benefit from the change I've proposed and allow for a purposeful redevelopment from commercial to residential. Meaning more units, more affordable units and more people traversing downtown streets morning noon and night.

He says this ordinance promotes investment in the downtown. I am aware of many developers waiting to jump in and convert and repurpose buildings like these as soon as this ordinance is approved. I urge this committee to do so.

So I just want to make sure that what we've received here today in public comment and in written comment has all been in support of the proposal I've put forward as an alternative. Thank you chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:24:14 - 2:24:18)
Thank you Alderman Riley. I know you mentioned holding you're not making any motions at this time.

[Speaker 2] (2:24:18 - 2:24:21)
At this time I would like the opportunity to close.

[Speaker 1] (2:24:21 - 2:24:28)
Sure sure. I know I saw Alderman Burnett and LaSparta go in that order. Any others?

Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 4] (2:24:28 - 2:25:21)
Sure thank you Mr. Chairman. First of all I think both of these ordinances are great and both of them of course you know touch on getting more affordable housing and being able to convert buildings in the downtown area to residential from commercial. But also I think Lamont is talking about being able to do something with do something with vacant properties and new developments also.

So I just wanted to ask Mr. Chairman and maybe this is to Patrick. How many 16s do we have in these boundaries and are the boundaries the same for both ordinances? I would ask our zoning administrator to take that.

[Speaker 3] (2:25:22 - 2:25:55)
So I'll take the Patrick Murphy with the Department of Planning. The second question first. The boundaries impacted are the same.

It would just be the downtown zoning districts which are defined in the zoning code both the original and the expanded street designation. So those the the applicability of this calculation would only be to the same geographies. As far as the quantity of parcels that are zoned dash 16 today I don't have that exact number but I can prepare a map that highlights with the impacted wards and get that back to the vice chairman.

[Speaker 4] (2:25:57 - 2:26:27)
Okay and then I know Alderman Riley mentioned about the existing buildings and having this new and I didn't get an opportunity to read his ordinance. Do it automatically trigger for those buildings if they're converted to with this new ordinance to to have affordable housing? Do it automatically get triggered to have affordable housing as part of it like it would a zoning change?

Alderman Riley?

[Speaker 3] (2:26:31 - 2:26:33)
I'm sorry Alderman I was trying to make arrangements.

[Speaker 4] (2:26:35 - 2:26:51)
With Alderman Riley's ordinance automatically once this ordinance go in do it automatically trigger all of those existing buildings if they convert to residential to have to do 20 percent affordable?

[Speaker 3] (2:26:53 - 2:27:04)
Yes but it would do so because in order to take advantage of either ordinance it would require the establishment of a planned development and then the establishment of a planned development automatically requires compliance with ARO.

[Speaker 4] (2:27:04 - 2:27:05)
Okay so it'd be a zoning change.

[Speaker 3] (2:27:06 - 2:27:12)
All of them would be zoning changes all of them would be planned developments all of them would ARO compliant or ARO mandated.

[Speaker 1] (2:27:12 - 2:27:19)
I just want to say that any project we're talking about is all all of it's a zoning change all of the planned development all of it's 20 percent ARO.

[Speaker 4] (2:27:19 - 2:28:14)
Okay so one more question so and Pat you know and I appreciate your professionalism and your zoning jargon right if you can lay it out in layman's terms a little bit more so this kind of been broken down to me like okay you get more if you allow for smaller units in the FAR in the minimum lot area and you get more units and because you get more units you get more affordable housing too. Can you can you explain that with the with the new buildings how does this minimum lot area explain it in layman's term how the minimum lot area would be changed because of this?

[Speaker 3] (2:28:15 - 2:29:45)
Okay so when the current bonus system was created an ability to add additional floor area was granted and as Alderman Riley said it was in an uncapped capacity in dash 16 districts. One of the calculations we did to balance that additional floor area is to allow for minimum lot area reductions meaning you could provide more bulk in your building but you would also have the ability to fill it with additional units so as opposed to adding thousands of square feet and only being able to provide two three and four bedroom units you could provide a higher quantity of smaller units so there is an ability in the in either ordinance to add additional square footage or legalize square footage that exists and then fill it with a higher quantity of dwelling units and they can be smaller units they could still be larger units but you have the ability to add smaller.

One of the features of the ARO ordinance today that's different than the previous version prior to 2021 is an ability to take into account the quantity of square footage being made for affordable purposes as opposed to just a unit count so there can be avenues that someone could provide more square footage less dwelling units but still calculate the same under ARO from a quantity of square footage allowed and bedrooms allowed for affordability purposes.

[Speaker 4] (2:29:46 - 2:30:05)
So basically the the current minimum lot area allow for the the minimum lots to be larger right you have larger units and then what he's proposing is to allow for smaller units to get more units? Not necessarily smaller it just can allow for more of it.

[Speaker 3] (2:30:07 - 2:30:55)
So as you calculate floor area there is an inverse calculation done of minimum lot area. The larger volume you have you then would need minimum lot area relief in order to fill that with a with a higher quantity of units. So if someone simply wanted to provide 3,000 square foot five bedroom units they would probably not run into this issue regardless of their zoning.

They may other issues but they wouldn't have this issue. This becomes more into play in either ordinance because you're taking a high degree of volume and you want to fill it with more smaller units. So you need an MLA reduction a lesser degree of restriction on your unit quantity in order to get a larger volume of a larger quantity of units.

[Speaker 4] (2:30:56 - 2:31:16)
And in each of these situations just like with both of these developments the alderman has the prerogative whether to let it go or not right? If the alderman don't like it he don't have to or the community don't like it it doesn't have to pass right?

[Speaker 3] (2:31:17 - 2:31:37)
Both of these ordinances mandate the establishment of a plan development and both of them are subject to local review and committee authority as well as a review before the bank. So yes there is no difference in aldermanic involvement on either of these ordinances or compared to any of the authorities that exist today for residential plan development.

[Speaker 4] (2:31:38 - 2:31:48)
All right so if the community don't want more smaller units in a building they can say they don't want right? An alderman can say they don't want.

[Speaker 3] (2:31:48 - 2:31:50)
The alderman would still have their same authority today yes sir.

[Speaker 4] (2:31:50 - 2:32:24)
If the community is okay with it it's cool then it goes. Same way we are now but we're just allowing for folks to utilize more square footage for more apartments in a building. Yes sir.

All right and alderman rallies is allowing for it to be apartments alderman robertson is allowing it to be built as as apartments alderman rally is allowing it to be converted to apartments alderman robertson is allowing it to be built as apartments with more units in it correct alderman robinson's is for new construction alderman riley's is for existing

[Speaker 3] (2:32:24 - 2:32:29)
that haven't previously utilized a bonus but just so it's clear we do not regulate whether it's a

[Speaker 4] (2:32:29 - 2:32:48)
condominium or an apartment so it just has to be residential residential okay strike the apartment residential okay all right i think i got it so both of them to me sound good both of them sound good thank you thank you vice mayor uh i have alderman espada followed by conway and then

[Speaker 6] (2:32:48 - 2:33:40)
hoppins thank you so much chair again like i feel like i'm playing in somebody else's sandbox because there will never be a day that i have dx-16 zoning and never say never the vice mayor good morning after the next redistricting i suppose um haha um but like to to speak into to speak into this so i just want just a couple clarifying points to each of either one of the sponsors it strikes me that alderman robinson your your ordinance provides the benefit being discussed to both existing buildings and new construction alderman riley and conway and so forth's ordinance specifically and only to um existing buildings is that a correct understanding

[Speaker 3] (2:33:40 - 2:34:00)
can i get a yes there is there is a patchwork department planning there is a that is the uh one of the two distinctions is new versus existing and if it's existing it cannot have taken advantage of a previous bonus uh a floor area bonus okay question number two there there

[Speaker 6] (2:34:00 - 2:34:15)
is nothing in alderman robinson's ordinance that would then exclude the benefits described in alderman riley's ordinance is that also accurate alderman robinson's ordinance could be applied to

[Speaker 3] (2:34:15 - 2:34:21)
existing buildings and it uh it does not have it does not have the stipulation related to a previous

[Speaker 6] (2:34:21 - 2:34:47)
bonus having been utilized understood and question number three this only makes these benefits permissible rather than mandatory as vice mayor burnett chaired the alderman can always say this is not what i want in or his community or their community could say these are not benefits that i prefer to see in this development is that also accurate community participation authority

[Speaker 3] (2:34:47 - 2:34:51)
involvement uh remains the same under both ordinances as it is today under all planned

[Speaker 1] (2:34:51 - 2:34:58)
developments okay thank you very much thank you chair thank you uh alderman conway be brief uh

[Speaker 5] (2:34:58 - 2:35:42)
mr chairman um my ward would be heavily affected by this by this ordinance um not only because of the effect on building the loop that alderman riley spoke of but also the the additional traffic that would be created by newly upzoned dx 16 buildings that are that are just outside my ward potentially in the in the fulton lake lake street area where we've uh approved over a thousand units already here here today so as a result of that as someone who has a ward that's heavily affected by this i i would say i i want to put on record that i oppose the broad mla reduction but i am for uh i am for the compromise ordinance of allowing uh of allowing the reduction on existing dx 16s

[Speaker 1] (2:35:42 - 2:35:46)
thank you mr chairman thank you alderman alderman hopkins followed by rosa

[Speaker 25] (2:35:48 - 2:36:22)
yeah thank you mr chairman uh i do have some dx 16 in my ward as well not not a lot but in any case i i really can't envision uh any likely scenario in the near future where either of these two proposals would be brought to bear for uh for a project in my ward um but my question for the zoning administrator is um would yeah would there be uh is there any inherent conflict or would there be anything that couldn't be reconciled with the language of these two proposals that are amending the same section of code if we were to pass both of them today and have it you know be applicable to new construction as well as existing

[Speaker 3] (2:36:25 - 2:36:45)
i would be i i could not say what council may want to do to strike a compromise between the two from a language standpoint uh that would if if both ordinances were to pass in the form they are now that would be a discussion with the law department to decide how to merge or treat

[Speaker 25] (2:36:46 - 2:37:15)
the the dual ordinances yeah i mean just looking at the language there's you know nothing to stop the uh new language from being fused into the existing underscore it would still read you know like as a as a complete sentence so how would the if we were to do that what would the application of that look like regardless of how you tweak the order of the words so if there is a

[Speaker 3] (2:37:15 - 2:38:03)
path forward to combine the two ordinances then it would it would have to uh well there it would there would there would need to be an ability to the the alderman riley ordinance is the more restrictive of the two ordinances it limits it to the types of buildings that can be allowed and it puts a limitation on the uh previous use or presence of bonus floor area the alderman robinson ordinance is more permissive and so if council were to approve both there are stipulations already in the zoning ordinance about a more restrictive ordinance controlling so what that merge language would look like i couldn't say for certain but of the two ordinances the more restrictive would be the one that takes back

[Speaker 25] (2:38:03 - 2:38:08)
am i misreading the intent though that the more permissive language applies only to new construction

[Speaker 3] (2:38:10 - 2:38:19)
yes the correct the distinct yes there is no speak of no there's no speaking of new construction in alderman riley's ordinance so yes the more permissive one alderman robinson's does apply

[Speaker 25] (2:38:19 - 2:38:22)
equally to both types of bills so then in the case of new construction there wouldn't be an

[Speaker 3] (2:38:22 - 2:38:55)
obvious conflict that would need to be reconciled if the degree to which the ordinances are are combined exclude is decided to exclude the new new construction because the more restrictive ordinance would exclude the new construction so if they're both approved if they're to be merged then you know save for any other uh actions by council host committee then the more restrictive ordinance would take control if both are to be published and proceed it's a little confusing

[Speaker 25] (2:38:55 - 2:39:01)
but i think i i understand now thank you uh mr murphy great thank you alderman uh alderman

[Speaker 9] (2:39:01 - 2:40:51)
ramirez rosa thank you so much you know we're in a housing crisis and that housing crisis is being felt across the city of chicago in many different ways in my community that housing crisis has led to displacement as long-time residents cannot keep up with uh rising rents and so i know that every single unit that is built in the central business district every single unit that is built in the west loop river north in the south loop downtown in fulton market those units help alleviate that housing crisis in the city of chicago and they provide new residents moving to the city more affluent residents residents who have some of those uh very coveted and well-paying jobs it provides them with an option where they want to live and it alleviates the pressure that's being felt in other communities across the city and allows us to mitigate the displacement that's happening in many neighborhoods so i have been proud to support every single zoning change that has come forward every single plan development that has come forward that leads to new housing being built downtown and in the central business district so i want to really commend my colleague alderman lamont robinson for bringing forward his ordinance i've asked my staff to sign me on as a co-sponsor i hope that uh mr robinson will have me as a co-sponsor because i think this is a really great piece of legislation i know this question has been asked a number of different ways already of our zoning administrator but i'm going to ask it again because i believe that it bears um understanding and it helps me understand exactly what we are doing right now and i think it helps the public understand so between the two ordinances that are before us right now which one would allow for more housing to be built uh in the central business district

[Speaker 3] (2:40:57 - 2:41:20)
if new construction were undertaken then alderman robinson's ordinance would be available to those projects so i could not project which one might result in more units but there is an equal ability to utilize it for existing structures in existing dash 16 zone districts

[Speaker 9] (2:41:21 - 2:41:35)
got it so um so in in theory because alderman robinson's ordinance is more permissible it could lead to more housing being added to existing structures downtown

[Speaker 3] (2:41:35 - 2:41:56)
no existing structures are equally uh treated under existing structures can be equally calculated under both ordinances save for the the prior floor area bonus caveat the only distinction would be for new construction whether it's unimproved land today or a building that is demolished

[Speaker 9] (2:41:56 - 2:42:43)
and something is built new in its place so alderman robinson's text amendment would allow for new construction to tap into uh more housing yes it does okay and um i i guess the the question is um if these um ordinances right as as you've already discussed and as you've already laid out in both instances any development whether it's an existing development seeking to tap into this to add new housing or whether it's a new development seeking to add additional housing if alderman robinson's ordinance is on the books um they would still have to go through the plan commission process they would still have to go through the zoning process every project that utilizes either

[Speaker 3] (2:42:43 - 2:43:12)
new bonus floor area or utilizes mla calculations that are done pursuant to bonus floor area that may already exist an existing building is already a 24 far in a dash 16 district if the applicant seeks to use mla calculations that take advantage of that that are only made available because of the bonus floor area then a plan development is automatically triggered plan commission review is required aro is triggered and committee on zoning and city council are also involved so the

[Speaker 9] (2:43:12 - 2:44:06)
local alder person through the normal means that are already available to them would have an opportunity to weigh in and to decide whether or not assuming alderman robinson's ordinances on the books that local alder person would still have the ability to weigh in uh and and to sort of you know have a a say in terms of what that development looks like and whether or not they're able to take advantage of the ordinance uh that alderman robinson is proposing they would have equal authority under both ordinances yes sir okay so so then my question then is um for alderman riley what then is if if if alderman robinson's ordinances on the books and you will still have a say as the local alder person as that development goes through uh the plan commission and goes through uh the zoning committee what then is is the intention with with your language why do you want to disallow new construction from tapping into this benefit to add more housing

[Speaker 2] (2:44:07 - 2:47:24)
thank you for the thank you for the question um to be clear i'm not looking to disallow this for new construction the code currently already does that um but this isn't really about whether or not we're giving up control over local development in our respective wards it's not um as as mr murphy has stated whether it's new construction or redevelopment of an existing building we would have to go through our planned development process in the central business district um that's not what it's issue here it's a policy decision and the reason why we heard from historic preservation advocates and other developers in support of my proposed compromise is that um our existing building stock in the central business district our class b and c buildings so not these brand new shiny towers but the the skyscrapers of old um they're suffering from historic vacancy rates right now so much so that that mayor johnson has been working with myself on lasalle street reimagined in the loop to convert these old historic bank buildings into mixed use with a substantial portion of affordable units in them um if we're going to be extending the same economic benefit by relaxing these regulations on new construction for prospective real estate developers who haven't decided whether or not they want to make an investment downtown we are then disadvantaging existing buildings which are already built and in most cases built for a different purpose and so if you're extending this benefit to both new and old it really does come at the expense of the older buildings which is where we have the greatest concern in the central business district today um we can't afford to allow our our most our most difficult buildings to repurpose and redevelop and frankly rejuvenate and put to better use um if we're at the same time giving the exact same benefit to folks who could build a glass box to the specs of their prospective tenant and so that's the issue it's there's a limited there's a limited amount of ways we can help um our challenged older buildings down here and by limiting this benefit to those we can do the most good is what i'm arguing but this is not a um a debate over which one delivers more affordable units alderman robinson's or mine as as patrick murphy has stated on the record it depends on the building depends on the lot it depends on a lot of different factors and there could be circumstances where the older building redevelopment can provide more affordable units at a cheaper cost than new and so that's the thing i'm asking you all to consider here i don't have it in for new development we we promote that downtown every day all of the aldermen who represent downtown um so that's really what this question is about um can we can we really focus on the older buildings that need to be saved first while there are plenty of other tools and incentives to promote new development throughout the city thank you chairman so would it be fair then to characterize your position

[Speaker 9] (2:47:24 - 2:47:44)
that by disallowing new construction from tapping into this additional density and only allowing it for existing structures that you believe it will incentivize developers to go in and rehab those existing structures and turn them into additional housing units for the city of chicago is that fair

[Speaker 2] (2:47:44 - 2:47:56)
yes that's absolutely correct and that's really the purpose of of of my more limited ordinance is to spur that well i i can certainly be sympathetic to that uh viewpoint and i hear

[Speaker 9] (2:47:56 - 2:49:14)
what you're saying and i will also add that i think that through your local land use and zoning policy for your ward if alderman robinson's ordinance were to be in effect and yours were not you could still accomplish that outcome because you could say hey i know this ordinance is on the books and know you can tap into that but when it comes to the 42nd ward i'm only going to allow it for existing buildings that have been up for 20 years and i think that would be a totally fair position for you to take i think that the other alderman impacted by this policy in their wards could also take that same position but if alderman robinson wants to be able to uh give this density uh bonus um or this uh you know additional density to new construction in his ward i think that's a good thing and i think that it adds to uh the uh housing that we need here in the city of chicago and i think it leads to additional housing overall so um i do appreciate your uh position alderman riley but uh based upon the conversation that we've had here today i feel as if you're able to still accomplish that compromise um without having to pass this ordinance um because ultimately the local alderman and the local community will still have their say in terms of the total number of units uh and what that development looks like so thank you thank you alderman ramirez rosa um i

[Speaker 1] (2:49:14 - 2:49:21)
have alder knutson followed by paul i think i had harris then burnett you ever had that oh just

[Speaker 11] (2:49:21 - 2:50:21)
stretching alderman knutson thank you vice chair um and i'll have a question for the zoning administrator but um you know i i think like several of us do there's good themes in both of these because we're all just trying to figure out the best way to boost and increase development um so for patrick murphy i've just got a question about buildings that already are built but might not conform and it's it's just a one-off question but i appreciate the way you've been breaking things down without uh jargon like alderman burnett said so um if there's an old building built in a 16 um that's already built to a 24 far and they don't need a change under alderman riley's ordinance do they still need a planned development if they want to go residential so there's a couple answers to that so if you have an existing building that's a 24 so it's

[Speaker 3] (2:50:21 - 2:51:55)
non-conforming from a floor area standpoint so it's not a planned development there's no you know it's the building it just it just is uh there are mla calculators that you can utilize which allow you to get a certain quantity of units by right there's a table in the zoning code and provided you use those calculations just up to beneath the threshold that triggers a planned development then you can proceed by right this is how some of the calculations for renovations on the south street focused buildings were viewed this is how we've looked at all older buildings that have non-conformity from a floor area standpoint so if you have an existing building non-conforming from floor area you can get to a calculation of residential units that does not trigger a pd so that it can proceed by right on the other hand if you were to seek to utilize any type of mla relief whether either of these ordinances pass or not to fill existing non-conforming floor area space so i have an enormous amount of additional floor area beyond what my zoning district would allow by right today if i use any of the calculations on the bonus system even if i'm not adding floor area you're still triggering a plan development and so these two ordinances provide a path for people to use additional mla relief that is only available through a plan development so regardless of which one uh if they are regardless of whether either are approved they will both have the same effect from a legislative process for any project

[Speaker 11] (2:51:55 - 2:52:04)
that seeks to utilize okay so in that situation where i can do the project by right um i wouldn't

[Speaker 3] (2:52:04 - 2:52:21)
need to do affordable right you would not be hitting a zoning related trigger for affordability okay your project may be utilizing financial resources from the city so you have a tiff obligation you may have other triggers within the aero ordinance but you would not have a zoning

[Speaker 11] (2:52:21 - 2:52:28)
trigger in the arrow okay okay great point made thank you thank you alderman um alderman hall

[Speaker 24] (2:52:30 - 2:52:41)
thank you mr chair i have a quick question i don't know who would answer you or alderman rally but how many uh potential new units will come with the uh the pending lasalle street project

[Speaker 3] (2:52:43 - 2:53:00)
oh um i could i can teach you so there are there are four projects that the department is currently pursuing with the administration to utilize the uh you know city incentives for redevelopment along the south street i can get you the full unit count number i'll get it back through the chair they're not solely in the 42nd ward but i will get you i'll get you the count if you wanted to ballpark

[Speaker 1] (2:53:00 - 2:53:04)
those four projects uh alderman conway yeah in fact three of the four projects are actually

[Speaker 5] (2:53:04 - 2:53:29)
in my ward it's about a thousand new units and 300 of them are affordable yes i say that i got a thousand new units a thousand new units with 300 of them they're affordable with the four projects that have been announced it was it is worth noting it was heavily teased in the press conference that two more that two more would will be announced uh as well and those ones actually have a higher percentage of affordable than these gotcha gotcha yes your second question is um it

[Speaker 24] (2:53:29 - 2:53:47)
was mentioned uh in passing the amount of vacancies um that were you know already present downtown and the concern that it would increase what's the percentage of vacancies now that you made reference to who can answer you will well from a i could not i would not want to

[Speaker 3] (2:53:47 - 2:54:09)
speak for the exact percentage of units or buildings that are existing vacant i know there are uh reports related to commercial vacancy rates uh not all of those buildings can be either economically or physically converted for residential use so i couldn't guess how many could become new residential units uh i would i would not be able to guess for you that number okay i'll

[Speaker 1] (2:54:09 - 2:54:14)
tell you alderman that the figure is there was 16 willis towers full of vacant space in our downtown

[Speaker 24] (2:54:14 - 2:54:25)
area that that figure has been around a lot you guys so i'm just trying to understand it and so i cannot go say no just be but but just that does not necessarily mean that all of that is

[Speaker 3] (2:54:25 - 2:54:36)
able to be converted either physically or uh financially regardless of the presence of either of these ordinances or uh you know incentives that the city may offer yes so what up what i

[Speaker 24] (2:54:36 - 2:55:17)
heard and correct me if i'm wrong that the concern is currently that this project would essentially become a little bit difficult or it would be hard to sell new opportunities because of what we haven't gotten right or we haven't gotten started in the conversion and what have you like make it make sense that was mentioned by you correct you you mentioned well you may he may mention of the fact that the uh newer developments housing that is would not be as appealing to developers or potential partners because of the yeah make that's why i needed a

[Speaker 1] (2:55:17 - 2:55:47)
point of information i was confused i think the comment that was made was that if the bonus is given to both new and old uh existing buildings would be less attractive if that is a good summary one more time so if the bonus applies to both existing and new construction that the interest in existing building conversions would be lesser because you could get the same bonus on a new building as well i think was the point that was made just go ahead alderman riley yes just to

[Speaker 2] (2:55:47 - 2:56:19)
directly answer the question what the chairman is saying is essentially true um that if you if developers can choose between buying a site for new construction versus rehabilitating an existing building the inclination will be to go with a new development and so the idea here is the buildings that really need the help and and the incentives to have redevelopment and reuse are the existing ones that are typically more difficult to construct for a new use that's that's the purpose

[Speaker 24] (2:56:20 - 2:56:52)
gotcha so if i'm just following along that alderman robinson's piece of legislation opens the door for more people to have access to opportunities in newer developments as well as as it pertains to housing as well as older mixed in correct like there's a gateway i mean a pathway rather for more affordable housing to be done in new like make it make sense if you can it it could

[Speaker 3] (2:56:52 - 2:57:37)
allow for an opportunity for uh unimproved properties to be uh to to take advantage of the mla reduction yes uh you know i i could not say in absolute terms whether it will always result in additional affordable units because as alderman riley was saying there might be different pressures for or against renovations or new construction that are more financially related so new construction may not necessarily always be additive to units that come about through renovation there may be renovations that do not take place for other reasons so there's an opportunity to utilize uh new buildings under alderman robinson's ordinance that doesn't necessarily always mean it will be an absolute increase in the overall quantity of affordable

[Speaker 24] (2:57:37 - 2:57:55)
units but it'd be the opportunity or the there could be yes there's a possibility okay that's true so and if we merge the two could you explain one more time exactly the uh the different like what will happen if the merger takes place what will be excluded in alderman robinson's

[Speaker 3] (2:57:57 - 2:58:40)
alderman riley's ordinance is the more restrictive of the two ordinances were they both to be approved and passed and move ahead simultaneously the more restrictive elements would take authority or supersede the more more lax ordinances or terms under alderman robinson's now that presumes that there's no additional discussion by council as far as how to potentially merge those two ordinances before the committee were to approve them so there's an there is still an opportunity for the council to do that but to take it on its face value if both are approved simultaneously the more restrictive of the two ordinances uh would uh would take effect absence other

[Speaker 24] (2:58:40 - 2:59:02)
absent changes by council yes just as i'm going through the questions that were asking me um with alderman robinson's piece of legislation there opens up again more opportunities and you know includes more people to have access to new opportunities to live downtown right

[Speaker 3] (2:59:03 - 2:59:09)
it creates the opportunity for more land to be redeveloped under a dash 16 for additional units

[Speaker 1] (2:59:09 - 2:59:14)
it that it creates the opportunity for it yes okay thank you that's all i wanted

[Speaker 4] (2:59:14 - 3:03:28)
thank you uh alderman vice mayor burnett anyone else then yeah so so thank you very much um and again i think both of these are good ordinances um and i understand what alderman riley saying about these new developments may not make the older developments or the existing developments look as attractive and that's the argument that we have that can that can expand across the city right everybody could say you shouldn't do no development downtown because won't be any development going to the west side or south side you know um i think even with the existing developments even right now with the reimagined lasalle street we have to use public incentives in order to make these things work because there's a lot of other variables that go into dealing with these buildings outside of the bonus part uh because uh you know finance and all of those other things the taxes whatever the case may be uh in in those communities maybe maybe maybe in and i look at like i look at my area um you know some of these developments we just voted on a lot of neighborhood opportunity bonuses are going into it tip money all that stuff and a lot of that would be used potentially to help with some of these other things that that may go on and hopefully they can help these other developments downtown or whatever could that same thought be in place with the new potential development that may get this bonus with the 16s that some of that money that come from those bonuses can go to help the existing buildings that need help can we cut the baby in half and and and let it be a win-win situation for all of downtown i mean none of us want downtown to be vacant none of us you know all of us want our downtown to be healthy i mean even with the central area plan right now in the central area plan that we're planning right now we're literally planning the central area plan right now the central area plan calls for more density in the central area because not only do the central area um the central area fees the rest of the city the rest of the city fees off of the central area and in order to to get money we need the central area to be healthy to do well so we can get the tax dollars off of it and it can help with everything else as far as transportation schools housing all of the above so i don't i i just got a problem with killing killing projects to save a project right i think we should figure out a way of being able to save and help all of these projects i understand downtown matter of fact um you know i was in some of those meetings when they came up with the idea about reimagined downtown and and i was the one i was one of the ones who encouraged that we should put affordable housing in them to help sustain these properties because they did it in the 80s right that's how they saved a lot of buildings in the 80s with with uh money from the federal government presidential towers was saved because of that you know so i think there i think i think both of these ordinances are good i think but we i really think that if we're really concerned about the existing buildings downtown we have to really you know have a downtown meeting about i mean i'm not downtown like that but those guys downtown really need to have a downtown meeting and see if there's a way that they can benefit from these things happening if more if more people get incentivized to build because of the ml whatever it's called the minimum lot area is being you know softened if more people have are incentivized to build we all benefit from it we should all benefit from it that that's what i'm saying and whether it's an old building or

[Speaker 1] (3:03:28 - 3:03:40)
a new building great thank you vice mayor um i see alvin conway i'd like to speak since we're on round two with speakers i'll ask you to be brief and then i'll ask the sponsors if they want

[Speaker 5] (3:03:40 - 3:05:02)
to close and then we'll entertain some motion yeah first i would say it is worth noting that both of these ordinance will expand density both of them are expanding what we currently have it's the question of whether we want to start with existing properties or we want to go into all the all the new additional as well and you know the 34th ward is roughly how you know it's about 60 in the west loop and 40 uh and the in and the loop side and on the west loop side we have a lot of new development in the fulton and lake street areas in the 27th ward and that's that's great but that doesn't quite have the transit infrastructure that you see downtown and because of that we feel significant significant traffic impacts um down on washington and madison and monroe etc well on the loop side we have all of the train lines come down to the loop and as a result of that it makes much more sense for us to proceed with this additional density in existing dx 16 dx 16 buildings and therefore i'd ask my my colleagues to support the existing building compromise as opposed to the um broad broad increase that uh was otherwise

[Speaker 1] (3:05:02 - 3:05:18)
proposed thank you thank you alderman i'm going to close the comments on that and offer the two sponsors an opportunity to close if they choose who would like to go first neither alderman

[Speaker 14] (3:05:18 - 3:07:05)
robinson yes i want to thank my colleagues for this spirited uh conversation um to my colleague and my all of my colleagues that are representatives of the downtown districts again i look forward to working with all of them to figure out a way for us to be able to create opportunities for quality affordable housing downtown as as our vice mayor mentioned it'll be a great thing for the city of chicago alderman rosa also mentioned creating opportunities for everyone to be able to live in a vibrant vibrant area in our downtown districts whether that be in existing buildings or new buildings um we have a great opportunity in this council and the city of chicago to do something great and that is again to be able to not just provide folks affordable housing but quality affordable housing in a vibrant area to get more folks downtown and our business districts the other challenge that we're facing is the businesses that are downtown that are struggling this ordinance will also help those businesses that are struggling and also to be able to bring more businesses downtown and so i ask my colleagues to allow me the opportunity to create opportunities in our downtown business districts with new housing that's affordable and quality for all thank you very much thank you

[Speaker 2] (3:07:05 - 3:09:17)
alvin riley uh thank you chairman i'll be brief we've had a pretty extensive conversation about this but to be clear this is about promoting residential development this is not about assisting downtown businesses it's about it's really a question of whether we want to prioritize more challenging existing building stock again only in the central business district this is not in the neighborhoods this is in the central business district b districts d-16 to be very specific um and so again i i would encourage us to um to prioritize those buildings there are no one i think is maybe maybe walderman burnett but but it's pretty close no one has has approved more new construction in the city than i have on this council i think that's a fair uh statement to make although walter is right there um i would just say that as was stated by patrick murphy with the department um this does preserve automatic discretion over plan developments and so as was stated earlier if a particular element doesn't want to use these tools they can reject the proposal um but i think as a matter of policy you know and as council that has been talking more and more about adaptive reuse as a good environmental policy as a city we tear down older buildings to replace them with new ones there's a massive environmental impact that comes with that and the greenest way to promote development city is adaptive reuse and i can tell you we have a lot of landmarked properties in the city that say that sit vacant that are located here in the central business district whether it's in my ward or alderman dowells or alderman conway's um and those are the ones we should be worried about first and so for that reason chairman i would move do pass on item 02024-0008948 that i introduced on april 17th 24 by a voice vote okay alderman riley has made a motion

We're looking to rezone it to a B2-5 to allow for a third floor to be constructed, to allow three additional units for a total of eight units on the property, eight parking spaces would be provided and zero parking would be provided as the building is lot line to lot line.

In addition to the rezoning requests, we're also asking for administrative relief to reduce two parking spots to zero, as well as variation relief to reduce the front yard, the north side setback, the south side setback and the rear yard setback as well. We have had conversations and zoning meeting with the alderman and his zoning committee. And I believe they issued a letter of support that the committee has.

And I would like to ask the committee and zoning members for favorable consideration, please.

[Speaker 1] (3:57:45 - 3:57:55)

All right, Jimena, you are gonna be our star witness, I think, today. You're gonna be here a while, so get comfy. Top of page 14 is document number 22424-T1 in the 25th ward, ordinance referred 41724.

Common address is 1145 West 17th Street. Change requests, an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to RM4.5 residential multi-unit district. Jimena Castro.

[Speaker 7] (3:58:46 - 4:00:08)
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. Again, for the record, my name is Jimena Castro, zoning attorney at Costa-Esquer. The property located at 1145 West 17th Street.

The property is a substandard sized lot, 24 by 124. It is a RT4 zoned property, ETOD to the Metro and Halstead. And it is improved with a two-story building with two dwelling units and two parking spaces, surface parking spaces.

And Carolina and Evans, as you can notice in the LLC, they're very excited about this property. They are looking to rezone the property to an RM4.5 for a new four-story building with three dwelling units, a two-car garage. They will be living in the building with their family.

And we are seeking administrative adjustment relief for the West side setback, the East side setback and the combined side setback to reduce all of those to fit the property. And we also have had extensive communication with the neighbors in person, on the phone, via email. And we currently have a letter of no objection from the alderman.

And we will be continuing conversations as is reflected in the letter of no objection with one of the neighbors next door to make sure that all the construction is satisfactory.

[Speaker 1] (4:00:09 - 4:00:13)
Thank you for mentioning that. Alderman Spada.

[Speaker 6] (4:00:14 - 4:00:21)
Before I motion, I'll just say, we love folks whose dream houses are three flat. That's some Chicago business there.

[Speaker 7] (4:00:22 - 4:00:29)
And they're a Pilsen family. So they wanted to build their own roots and with their own nuclear family. And they love it.

[Speaker 6] (4:00:29 - 4:00:33)
Multi-generational, let's do it. Thank you, Chair. Happy to make the motion.

Chair, the ayes have it and the substitute narrative and plans are accepted.

[Speaker 7] (4:01:36 - 4:02:41)
Thank you very much. The property is on B25. It is an ETOD property to the Pink Line.

It is one zoning lot, improved with two buildings, as is typical for this particular pocket of the city, with the front building being a two-story building containing six dwelling units and the rear building also being a two-story building containing two dwelling units. There is zero parking, as the current structures do not allow for parking. We're looking to rezone it to a B25 to allow a third floor addition for both buildings.

The front building will contain 12 dwelling units. The rear building will contain four dwelling units for a total of 16 dwelling units. Six bike spaces will be provided.

Zero parking, as I explained. And we're also seeking administrative adjustment relief to reduce eight parking spaces to zero and reduce the front, the side setbacks and the rear setback as well. We have engaged Reino Ruben from the Alderman's office is here.

We've engaged with his office and we have the letter of support.

[Speaker 1] (4:02:42 - 4:02:55)
Thank you. The Alderman has indicated his support. Any questions by committee members?

[Speaker 7] (4:02:55 - 4:03:00)

Alderman LaSpada moves to defer this item. All in favor, please say aye. All opposed say nay.

I'm gonna ensure the ayes have it. And this item is deferred.

[Speaker 7] (4:03:21 - 4:03:26)
And just for the record, we just wanna make sure that the neighbors for that matter are, we continue conversations with them.

[Speaker 1] (4:03:26 - 4:03:48)
We appreciate that. Middle of page 15 is document number 22413-T1 in the 25th ward ordinance referred 41724. Common address is 2863 West 21st street.

Change request RT4 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district to B23 neighborhood mixed youth district. There's a sub on this as well.

[Speaker 1] (4:03:55 - 4:04:05)
Alder LaSpada moves to accept the substitute and plans for the type one application. All in favor say aye. All opposed say nay.

Being sure the ayes have it. And the substitute and plans are accepted. Thank you.

[Speaker 7] (4:04:06 - 4:05:37)
Again, for the record, my name is Ximena Castro zoning attorney at Acosta-Escar for the property located at 2863 West 21st street. This property is zoned RT4. It's ETOD to the pink line.

There's a vacant lot. And we're looking to rezone it to a B23 to allow a three story building with nine dwelling units, five parking spaces, zero automobile parking. And we're also seeking administrative relief to reduce five parking spaces to zero and variation relief to reduce the front combined side setbacks, east and west side setbacks and the rear side setbacks.

And I would like to add for this particular building, if it's possible to go to the front elevation. My client purchased this property and he didn't realize that the building that existed there before was demolished. And he actually, the 25th ward loves to retain a lot of the character and a lot of the beautiful buildings that exist and they like to either encourage people to rehabilitate or to build buildings that look like they belong.

My client has decided to build the building out of brick and to replicate the existing facade of what was demolished. So that block will retain that building that was demolished and we're very happy about that. And we have a letter of no objection from the Alderman as well.

[Speaker 1] (4:05:37 - 4:05:52)
We do have that letter. Any questions by committee members? Seeing none, Alderman Ramirez moves to pass with the substitute narrative and plans.

All in favor, say aye. All opposed, say nay. Meeting chair, the ayes have it.

And this item will be reported at tomorrow's meeting.

[Speaker 7] (4:05:53 - 4:05:53)
Thank you.

Change request, the RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to B2-5 neighborhood mixed use district, Jimena Castro.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. For the record, my name is Jimena Castro. I'm a zoning attorney at Acosta-Esquer.

For the matter located at 2308 West 18th place. Before I continue, can we please incorporate the substitute narrative and plans to the record, please?

[Speaker 1] (4:06:28 - 4:06:40)
Yes, Alderman Spada moves to accept the, sorry, substitute narrative and plans, the type one application. All in favor, say aye. All opposed, say nay.

Substitute narrative and plans are before us.

[Speaker 7] (4:06:40 - 4:07:52)
Thank you. The property is an RT4 zoned property. It's ETOD to the Metro Western stop to the CTA Western stop and to the bus, the Western corridor.

It is improved with two buildings as is typical for this area. The front building is a two-story building with two dwelling units. The rear building is a two-story building with four dwelling units and there's currently zero parking due to the location of the buildings.

We're looking to rezone this property to a B2-5 to convert the two buildings into one building with a middle addition and a third floor addition to combine both buildings into one. The buildings will be 42 feet in height and there will be two additional dwelling units. So eight dwelling units in total.

So we're adding two. Two biking spaces will be provided, zero parking due to the extensive ETOD location. And we're also seeking administrative adjustment relief to reduce two parking spaces to zero and to reduce the side setbacks and the front setback as well and the rear setback.

[Speaker 1] (4:07:53 - 4:08:31)
Great, thank you. Any questions by committee members? Seeing none, all the person who went as moves do pass with the substitute narrative and plans.

[Speaker 1] (4:09:12 - 4:09:22)
Yes, we received an email from Alderman Irving today. And we have that on file. Any questions by committee members?

Alderman Spada.

[Speaker 6] (4:09:23 - 4:09:32)
Thank you, Chair. Jimena, are we doing the zoning change here because it's outside of the ADU pilot areas or do they need the additional FAR as well?

[Speaker 7] (4:09:32 - 4:09:33)
Yeah.

[Speaker 6] (4:09:34 - 4:09:35)
Which one? Or is it both?

[Speaker 7] (4:09:37 - 4:09:40)
So they need additional FAR, yeah.

[Speaker 6] (4:09:41 - 4:09:43)

Document number 22404-T1 in the 25th ward. Ordinance referred 41724. Common address is 1857 West 16th Street.

Change request is an M22 Light Industry District to C32 Commercial Manufacturing and Employment District. Come on in, have a seat right here and introduce yourself for the record. Sorry, I don't have a name on this one, unusual.

Great, Mr. Tepper, go ahead and give your name and title again for the record and proceed.

[Speaker 13] (4:10:41 - 4:11:38)
Sure, my name is Jordan Tepper. I'm the manager of Appalachia LLC. We're putting in a change request for 1857 West 16th Street from M22 Light Industry District to C32 Commercial Manufacturing and Employment District.

We're basically looking to establish a limited manufacturing and production facility which we can produce food and beverages at. And the secondary use would be allow us to operate a small to medium venue space with a maximum capacity of 200 people. This will allow us to have an accessory restaurant and tasting room.

We have six parking space currently on site. And we are seeking a parking relief through the TSL to reduce the parking requirements from the 20 parking spaces by 100%. Great.

Any questions by committee members?

[Speaker 1] (4:11:39 - 4:12:13)
Well, I know 25th ward is in support. All the person who went to his moves do pass. All in favor say aye.

All opposed say nay. Let me share the item passes will be reported out tomorrow. Thank you all.

Busy day in the 25th ward. Thanks guys. Busy day in the city here today.

All right, we're in the homestretch, I swear. Document number 22403-T1 in the 27th ward. Ordinance referred 41724.

Common address is 2405 West Grand Avenue. Change request C13 Neighborhood Commercial District to C13 Neighborhood Commercial District. We have Ed Kuss.

[Speaker 17] (4:12:16 - 4:14:25)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. For the record, my name is Ed Kuss, an attorney with the Taft Law Firm. We are here on behalf of the applicant 2405 West Grand LLC.

And I am joined today by Mr. Jim Piniella, who is the managing member of the applicant entity. We're here to request a technical amendment to a previously approved type one zoning map amendment for the property to allow the construction of a five story mixed use multifamily building, measuring approximately 60 feet in height and containing 36 dwelling units, 11 parking spaces, 36 bicycle parking spaces, and one loading dock with some ground floor commercial space. In July 2022, the city council approved the type one map amendment for this property from M1-2 to C1-3 Commercial District.

The subject property is irregular in shape. It's like a trapezoid and contains approximately 11,200 square feet of site area. The site right now is substantially vacant and unimproved.

The current amendment is necessary, first of all, to extend and renew the 2022 type one zoning map amendment, which otherwise would expire this summer. And pursuant to the modified type one procedures, we would like to get a variation for a reduction in the rear setback for floors containing dwelling units from 30 feet to zero feet. Again, that is because of the irregular shape of the lot.

And to authorize an administrative adjustment for a TOD location for parking reduction to reduce the minimum number of parking spaces from 36 to 11. The property is a transit served location directly along Western Avenue, CTA bus line corridor, and within about 400 feet of the Western Avenue Metro Rail Station entrance. Reduction of the dwelling unit count is proposed from 40 to 36, which was previously approved.

No changes are proposed with respect to the FAR or off-street parking. With that, Mr. Chairman, we respectfully request your approval and we are available for any questions.

[Speaker 1] (4:14:26 - 4:14:37)
Great, thank you. Any questions by committee members? Seeing any, all the person points as so moves.

All in favor say aye. Opposed say nay. Making sure the ayes have it and we'll report it out at council tomorrow.

[Speaker 13] (4:14:38 - 4:14:38)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (4:14:39 - 4:15:08)
Thank you. Now we're on the middle of page 17, which is document number 22373, the 29th Ward, ordinance referred 32024. Common address is 5730 to 5736 West Roosevelt Road.

Change request, M22, Light Industry District and Institutional Plan Development 933 to Institutional Plan Development 933 as amended. We have Anthony Licata.

[Speaker 13] (4:15:09 - 4:15:16)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As a quick correction, my name is Braden Lord. My colleague Anthony Licata and I collectively represent the applicant.

[Speaker 1] (4:15:16 - 4:15:18)
I was gonna say, Braden, I thought that was you, but.

[Speaker 13] (4:15:19 - 4:16:51)
Proceed. Either that or Anthony Licata got some good lotion. My name again for the record is Braden Lord.

I'm an attorney with the law firm of Taft, Titinius and Hollister, LLP, located at 111 East Wacker Drive in Chicago. I'm joined today by two members of the project team. Trudy Buehler is vice president of Mackie Consultants, our project engineer, and Erica Hawkins is the group director of human resources for the applicant, UHS of Hartgrove, Inc.

The applicant is requesting a plan development amendment to first rezone the UHS owned property at 5730 to 32 West Roosevelt Road. I'll refer to that as the UHS parcel. From institutional plan development number 933, the C22 motor vehicle related commercial district, and then to institutional development number 933 as amended.

Then second, to rezone the city owned property at 5736 West Roosevelt Road, which we'll refer to as the city parcel. From the M22 light industry district, the C22 motor vehicle related commercial district, and then to PD 933 as amended. The requested change is needed to authorize the construction of a two part addition to the existing hospital at the UHS parcel.

First, on the city parcel, a single story hospital addition containing approximately 18,367 square feet of floor area, 48 new patient beds, and 21 new vehicular parking spaces. Yeah.

[Speaker 6] (4:16:53 - 4:16:56)
Plan, the plan person? Yes.

[Speaker 13] (4:16:56 - 4:17:27)
Sorry, thank you. Well, I was tracking it. I appreciate it in case we forgot.

And then on the UHS parcel, a single story hospital addition containing approximately 4,410 square feet of floor area, 16 new bike parking spaces, and 129 new vehicular bicycle spaces as Alderman LaSpada helpfully helped us remember. The change request was considered and recommended for approval by the plan commission. It is April 18th meeting.

We request that the transcript and record of the plan commission be incorporated today.

[Speaker 1] (4:17:28 - 4:17:42)
Thank you. The item was heard and passed by the Chicago Plan Commission, which no one loves more than Alderman LaSpada, who makes a motion to incorporate all records and findings from that hearing. All in favor, please say aye.

Opposed, say nay. Please ensure the ayes have it. The records are incorporated.

[Speaker 13] (4:17:42 - 4:19:55)
Thank you, Chairman. Thank you, Alderman LaSpada. The proposed hospital expansion will result in the addition of severely needed capacity for inpatient behavioral health services in the Chicagoland area, the remediation of environmental contamination at the long vacant city parcel, and the reactivation of the city parcel with a property tax paying use.

Briefly, the overall site is bound by West Fillmore Avenue to the north, South Waller Avenue to the east, West Roosevelt Road to the south, and a commercial self-storage development to the west. As mentioned, the city parcel is currently vacant, and the UHS parcel is improved with the existing hospital. The proposed expansion will allow UHS to serve approximately 65 more patients per day and significantly improve the hospital's operations.

That's a great improvement for a hospital that is operated at or above full capacity as defined by state law every year since 2020. The expansion will also provide numerous landscape and pedestrian improvements, including the addition of a second row of perimeter trees along Roosevelt Road, an ADA accessible pedestrian path connecting Roosevelt Road to the existing hospital entrance, and the addition of a substantial number of new trees and shrubs. Slides four and five, as you've shown, show the proposed elevations, which were designed to seamlessly match and correspond with the first floor of the existing hospital.

The applicant anticipates that the proposed expansion will generate approximately $19.7 million of investments and approximately 120 permanent jobs and 60 to 80 construction jobs. As a planned development, hiring for the construction jobs will target 26% MBE, 6% WBE, 50% city resident hiring, and 10% 29th board hiring. Finally, the applicant has worked and communicated closely with Alderman Taliaferro in support of the proposed expansion, including meeting with the alderman in November of last year to discuss the proposed expansion in detail.

The alderman submitted a letter of support in advance of the planned commission hearing. We submit that the proposal satisfies the approval criteria for planned development projects and that no public interest would be served by its denial. And we respectfully request that the committee's favorable recommendation and are available to answer any and all questions the committee may have.

[Speaker 1] (4:19:56 - 4:20:09)
Thank you, Mr. Lord. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Taliaferro. Any questions by committee members?

I actually have a quick one. I know this is a healthcare expansion. Have you gone through the certificate of need process yet?

Or is that going to be required here?

[Speaker 13] (4:20:10 - 4:20:12)
It's simultaneous in that we're preparing that now.

[Speaker 1] (4:20:12 - 4:20:53)
Great. Best of luck with all the work then. Alderperson Fuentes moves to pass.

All in favor, say aye. All opposed, say nay. Seeing the Chair, the ayes have it.

It will be reported out tomorrow at council. Thank you all very much. Best of luck.

Thank you for doing this work too. All right, bottom of 17, document number 22374 in the 27th ward. Ordinance referred 23024.

Common address, 303 West Division Street, 1140 North Wells Street, and 202 West Hill Street. Change request, plan development 136 as amended to plan development 136 as amended. We have attorney Ed Cuss.

Once again.

[Speaker 17] (4:20:54 - 4:21:23)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and good afternoon and members of the committee. I am Ed Cuss with the Taft Law Firm. And I'm here this morning on behalf, this afternoon, I should say, on behalf of Ani Atrium Development, number one limited partnership.

I did have a representative of the applicant here, but he had another, he had a run to, so I apologize for not having him here. Anyway, this plan commission approved this matter at its meeting on April 18th, 2024. And we would ask that the record of proceedings from that meeting be incorporated into today's record.

[Speaker 1] (4:21:24 - 4:21:34)
Yes, Alder Ramirez makes the motion to incorporate all records and findings from the plan commission hearing. All in favor, say aye. All opposed, say nay.

Seeing the Chair, the ayes have it. All records are incorporated.

[Speaker 17] (4:21:34 - 4:22:17)
Okay, thank you. The subject property is generally located at the southwest corner of West Division and North Well Street. It's commonly known as Old Town Park.

This development was approved many years ago and is currently fully built out with four residential buildings. We are seeking a technical amendment to PD 136, specifically to sub area A. The amendment would allow two additional uses to the permitted use statement.

One is a medical service to accommodate a dental office. And the second is animal services to accommodate a veterinarian office with foggy daycare, I guess. There will be no new construction or other physical changes to the existing buildings.

Accordingly, we would ask for a favorable recommendation from this committee.

[Speaker 1] (4:22:19 - 4:23:11)
Great, any questions by committee members? I gotta tell you, dental and veterinary seems to be a growth industry in a lot of neighborhoods. So no surprise there.

With no comments beyond that, Alderman Westbottom moves to pass. All in favor, say aye. All opposed, say no.

And depending on the chair, the ayes have it. And it will be reported out tomorrow. Thank you.

Thank you, Mr. Kuss. Top of page 18, waiting patiently. Document number 22378 of the 27th Ward, ordinance referred 3-2024.

Common address, 734 North Milwaukee Avenue, 736 North Milwaukee Avenue, 700 North Carpenter Street, and 1040 West Huron Street. Change request is residential business plan development 1396 to residential business plan development 1396 as amended. Thank you for the patience of our friend, Katrina McGuire.

[Speaker 27] (4:23:13 - 4:23:30)
Pleasure to be here today. And I know it's been long, but as a certified zoning nerd, it was actually super interesting. Good, good.

It is my pleasure to be here on behalf of 730 North Milwaukee LLC, the applicant here. This is a project that was heard at plan commission in April. And we would ask that the record be incorporated herein.

[Speaker 1] (4:23:31 - 4:23:41)
Yes, Alder Fuentes makes a motion to incorporate all records and findings from the plan commission hearing. All in favor, say aye. All opposed, say nay.

Seeing and sharing the ayes have it, and the records are incorporated.

[Speaker 27] (4:23:41 - 4:24:33)
Thank you. And just very briefly, this is a project that was initially approved back in early 2018 with 226 units, 196 of which were ultimately constructed. The brick building, which is a portion of the existing PD, was always an office building.

It's an old loft building, as you can see. And what we are seeking here is to change that office use to residential. As with many office buildings, vacancy issues have plagued this building.

And so sort of the highest and best use here is to convert it to residential. We're seeking to add 32 units to this existing plan development. That's going to generate 6.4 ARO units. So six units that will be on site, and then about an $80,000 proportionate payment to of in lieu fees. We do enjoy the support of the neighbors of River West, as well as of Alderman Burnett, who I believe conveyed that to you before he had to leave today.

[Speaker 1] (4:24:34 - 4:24:35)
Yes, we do have Alderman Burnett's support.

[Speaker 27] (4:24:36 - 4:24:38)
Thank you. And with that, we'd ask for the committee support as well.

[Speaker 1] (4:24:38 - 4:24:52)
Thank you. Any questions by committee members? Hearing none, all the list bottom moves do pass.

All in favor, say aye. All opposed, say nay. The chair and the ayes have it.

And that will be reported out at tomorrow's council meeting.

[Speaker 27] (4:24:52 - 4:24:53)
Thank you. Thank you, committee.

[Speaker 1] (4:24:53 - 4:24:54)
Thank you.

[Speaker 27] (4:24:54 - 4:24:54)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (4:24:55 - 4:25:15)
All right, middle of page 18, document number 22238-T1 in the 27th Ward, ordinance referred 71923. Common address is 1153 West Grand Avenue. Change request, M22 Light Industry District to B23 Neighborhood Mixed Use District with Attorney Mark Kupiec.

[Speaker 21] (4:25:15 - 4:25:32)
Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, my name is Mark Kupiec. I represent the applicant. This is 41153 West Grand Avenue.

Procedurally, first, I do have a substitute narrative and revised plans that we'd like to proceed on.

[Speaker 1] (4:25:32 - 4:25:43)
Yes, Alderman Ramirez moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type one application. All in favor, say aye. All opposed, say nay.

The chair and the ayes have it. The substitute narrative and plans are accepted.

[Speaker 21] (4:25:44 - 4:27:23)
The subject property is improved by two or more old buildings. The assessor says more than 100 years old. Buildings are built lot line to lot line.

There's no parking currently. When the applicant bought the property, there were seven, seven apartments. When we filed the application, the zoning change request was to rehab the building for seven apartments.

It's an old building in need of repair. At Alderman Burnett's request, we visited with the River West neighbors, actually had two appearances there, one with mailed notice. River West was clear.

The front, the original front building was a mixed use building with a storefront on the ground floor on Grand Avenue. And their preference was to preserve that storefront and continue it because they have hopes of Grand Avenue coming back. So we did revise the plan and the revised plans that we filed do keep the storefront on the first floor front and remodel it with only six dwelling units.

We have, and we have a companion request, number one adjustment as to parking. This is a transit serve location. There's a CTA train station at Grand and Halstead, an older one, and also is it now a CTA train station at Morgan and Lake, both of which make this a transit serve location.

And in addition, there's a bus on Grand Avenue at a bus stop right in front of the subject property. So we're asking to reduce the parking requirement. The plan does show we are adding one parking space in the middle of the building.

So we're looking to reduce that parking to one space. In addition, the original.

[Speaker 1] (4:27:25 - 4:27:28)
No, we do. Oh, I'm sorry. Good, good.

[Speaker 21] (4:27:28 - 4:28:02)
And the original building, there was a three-story, three-flat building at the rear of the property, according to the old Sanborn map, which of course is still there and does not preserve the 30-foot rear setback. Because of the age of the building, there was no permit record. We're trying to establish the permit record.

So technically, we're asking for a variation for that rear building for the 30-foot rear setback. And Riverwest did send a letter of support to Alderman Burnett that I believe Alderman Burnett expressed his- Yes, Alderman Burnett has expressed his report.

[Speaker 1] (4:28:02 - 4:28:03)
Questions, Alderman Espada?

[Speaker 6] (4:28:04 - 4:28:20)
Thank you, Chair. It's a really great project. I really love the adaptive reuse.

I'm so curious, because if you pull it up, it's like a smaller building in the front, larger building in the back, single-story, I don't know what it is connecting them. What are you all gonna do with that middle space?

[Speaker 21] (4:28:21 - 4:28:34)
Well, he's gonna rehab it and bring it up to code. So there's existing apartments in that middle space, so he's gonna rehab those apartments, and in one portion of it, he's gonna add one parking space because the building is right on the alley.

[Speaker 6] (4:28:35 - 4:28:37)
That's fascinating. It's a very long building.

[Speaker 21] (4:28:37 - 4:28:55)
It's lot line to lot line, and we don't even know historically how many buildings. I think originally it was a front building and then a rear building, and maybe got filled in, but at this point, need of repair, he's gonna bring it up to code and preserve that storefront, which was a special request of the community group.

[Speaker 6] (4:28:56 - 4:28:59)
I think that's the right request. Thank you so much. Great project.

Thank you, Chair.

[Speaker 1] (4:28:59 - 4:29:37)
Thank you. Any other questions? Seeing none, all in favor, say aye.

Opposed, say nay. Please, Chair, the items have it. This is passed with a substitute narrative and plans.

We'll report it out tomorrow. Thank you. All right, Sarah, for the homestretch.

Here we go. Target number 22427-T1 in the 44th Ward, or ordinance referred 41724. Common address is 3731 to 3733 North Sheffield Avenue.

The change request is an RM5, residential multi-unit district, to RM6, residential multi-unit district. And we have Sarah Barnes.

[Speaker 8] (4:29:37 - 4:31:55)
Bringing up the kibbutz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and esteemed remaining members of the committee. Thanks for staying here.

I'm happy to be here this afternoon on behalf of the applicant, Wrigley Flats, LLC. Believe it or not, we were here just over a year ago. Same property owner, same applicant, for a type one zoning map amendment to make some improvements to the existing orange-rated building that comprises one of these sites.

Since that time, the plans actually haven't changed, but we just needed to come back to accommodate for the additional height with the vertical addition to the existing building. The height's still consistent with all of the other buildings on the block. We just needed the extra boost from the RM5 to the RM6 in order to allow for that, since the existing building is, again, historically significant.

So it had higher floor-to-ceiling ratios, which made it a little bit taller. We're following the, for the addition, we are following the existing lines of the historic building straight up and straight to the side laterally. So with the proposed zoning map amendment, we are also seeking an administrative adjustment for the setback relief to bring the existing non-conforming setback into compliance under the current zoning ordinance.

Talk about something kind of unique is the existing building, three-story building, actually has seven dwelling units in it right now. They're just very small and disjointed. So with the lateral addition, it allows for us, we're not increasing the density, but for one additional unit for a total of eight units, but it allows for bigger family-oriented rental units in that neighborhood.

And this is literally right behind Wrigley Field. So there's a need for it. It is a transit-served location, so there will be onsite parking for six vehicles.

With that, there's no substitutes or anything. So I just respectfully request a favorable consideration of this committee.

[Speaker 1] (4:31:56 - 4:32:32)
Thank you, Ms. Barnes. Being in the 44th Ward, I'll just say real quick, this is a legacy project that has been in the progress for a while. I know one of our public commenters may have referred the wrong address, but this is definitely a rehab and a reuse of an existing gray zone that is about 200 feet away from the Wrigley Field Bleacher Gate.

So I'm thinking maybe more renters than roommates than families right there. But nonetheless, an area that we know has a lot of interest, is well-served by transit, and has the support of the community. And so I would take a motion or answer any questions if any of my colleagues have any.

[Speaker 8] (4:32:33 - 4:32:44)
And we did, I'm sorry, I forgot. I should have said this. We did meet with East Lake and they reviewed it and endorsed it.

So that's where- No other questions?

[Speaker 1] (4:32:44 - 4:33:45)
All the Fuentes moves do pass. All in favor, say aye. All opposed, say nay.

Please make sure the ayes have it and we'll report it out tomorrow. Thank you. Top of page 19, we're gonna defer.

So it's document number 22328 in the 45th Ward, ordinance referred 12424, common address 3955 North Kilpatrick and 3865 North Milwaukee Avenue. Change request is RS3, residential single unit detached house district to B33 community shopping district and then to residential business plan development. Although the spotter makes a motion to defer the previously read item.

All in favor, say aye. All opposed, say nay. Make sure the ayes have it and we'll be deferred.

Middle of 19 is document number 22421-T1 in the 47th Ward, ordinance referred 41724. Common address is 2035 to 2043 West Irving Park Road. Change request is B11, neighborhood shopping district to B33 community shopping district.

We have attorney Sarah Barnes.

[Speaker 8] (4:33:46 - 4:34:37)
Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman and esteemed members of the committee. I'm happy to be here still this afternoon on behalf of the Advocant 2035 West Irving Acquisitions LLC. This is another legacy project for the peak in the 47th Ward.

Alderman Martin's not here today. He has offered a letter of support for the project, but I would commend him for his extraordinary community driven review process for all of these projects. We worked with the community for almost three years on this project.

It was a true collaborative effort towards that end. Oh, I should have began with the fact that we do have a substitute narrative and a substitute plan.

[Speaker 1] (4:34:37 - 4:34:46)
Yes, Alderman Fuentes moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type one application. All in favor, say aye. All opposed, say nay.

Making sure the ayes have it, the substitute narrative and plans are accepted.

[Speaker 8] (4:34:46 - 4:37:53)
Continue. Thank you. And the substitute is a result of that community driven process.

There were some last minute tweaks to the plans, but towards that end, we met with the 47th Ward Zoning Advisory Council, the North Center Neighborhood Association and the North Center Ravenswood Chamber of Commerce, all of whom have endorsed the project. With that, the project calls for the development of a new five story mixed use building at the subject site, which will contain a total of 37 dwelling units with commercial space on the first floor, as well as 15 onsite parking spaces. This is a transit serve location.

It's close to the Six Corners CTA station and traffic was a concern for the community. So we wanted to mitigate that by providing less onsite parking and also doing lease restrictions so that tenants in the building will not have a car. Towards that end, we are also offering seven affordable units, which will be provided onsite within the building.

And that'll be a mix of three bedroom, two bedroom and one bedroom units. In order to permit the proposal, in addition to the underlying zoning change to the B33, we are also seeking a couple of administrative adjustments. One is to reduce the parking just a little over that 50% maximum reduction from 37 to 15 spaces, which is just about a 60% reduction, as well as eliminating the required onsite loading berth.

There is room, however, for loading and unloading within the first floor garage. We're also seeking to reduce the required rear yard setback for residential floors from 30 feet to two feet. And this was in order to provide some larger units within the floor plate for the building, three bedroom and two bedroom units were specifically requested by the community.

And as well, one last administrative adjustment and that is to for a reduction in the required transparent window standard on not the Irving Park front facade, but actually on the side facade, which is sunny side, because this is located within 2,640 feet of the CTA train station. Both of those street frontages are treated as pedestrian streets. But unfortunately, the sunny side facade does contain part of the garage for the building.

So we didn't wanna put windows in the garage in order to screen the parking. With that, I'm happy to answer questions.

[Speaker 1] (4:37:54 - 4:38:05)
All right, no questions from committee member, although Ramirez moves do pass, all in favor say aye. Opposed say nay. That is true, the ayes have it.

We'll report it out tomorrow. Sarah, short and sweet. Document number.

[Speaker 8] (4:38:05 - 4:38:07)
Alderman's facade is potential.

[Speaker 1] (4:38:08 - 4:38:11)
I know, he doesn't have any anymore today. He's actually done with questions.

[Speaker 8] (4:38:12 - 4:38:15)
Okay, then you're getting the edited version.

[Speaker 1] (4:38:15 - 4:38:36)
Document number 22435-21 on the 47th Ward ordinance referred 41724 common address 4456-4458 Northwestern Avenue. Change request C12 neighborhood commercial district to B32 neighborhood mixed use district. Alderman Spada moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type one application.

All in favor say aye.

[Speaker 23] (4:38:36 - 4:38:36)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (4:38:36 - 4:38:42)
Opposed say nay. That is true, the ayes have it. The substitute narrative and plans are accepted.

Sarah.

[Speaker 8] (4:38:42 - 4:38:43)
There's also a substitute ordinance.

[Speaker 1] (4:38:45 - 4:38:53)
Oh. All right. Alderman Spada moves to accept the substitute ordinance for the type one application.

All in favor say aye. Opposed say nay.

[Speaker 26] (4:38:53 - 4:38:54)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (4:38:54 - 4:38:55)
Sarah, for the last item.

[Speaker 8] (4:38:57 - 4:40:42)
Again, Sarah Barnes, happy to be here on behalf of the applicant 4454 Northwestern Incorporated. The substitute ordinance was instead of a B23, we're gonna take it to a B33, which is consistent with the Western Corridor study. As well, the plans have changed to now incorporate commercial space on the ground floor, whereas it was originally submitted as a fully residential building.

With that, the proposal calls for a new five story, eight unit mixed use building, which again will have commercial space on the ground floor and eight dwelling units above. These units will be condominium units. There will be onsite parking therefore for a total of eight vehicles and that's one to one ratio for the condominiums.

So in order to permit the proposal, in addition to the type one underlying zoning classification change, we do need an administrative adjustment to reduce the minimum ground floor commercial area from 19 or by about 19%, which is under the 20% allowance and to increase the parking for a transit serve location to 100% and also to reduce the rear setback from 30 feet to 24, just about 24 and a half feet. And then as well to, once again, reduce the required transparent window standard on the side elevation, which is CLE street, again to accommodate for that garage. With no further ado, I'm happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (4:40:42 - 4:41:05)
Thank you, Ms. Barnes. Any questions by committee members? Seeing none, all the canoots and moves do pass.

All in favor say aye. All opposed say nay. Making sure the ayes have it.

We'll report it out at tomorrow's council. Thank you all for your patience. There'll be no further business before the body.

All the Ramirez moves we adjourn. All in favor say aye. All opposed say nay.

We are adjourned.
