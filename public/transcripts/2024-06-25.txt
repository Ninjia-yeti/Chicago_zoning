Out of respect for everyone's time, each speaker is limited to three minutes maximum. We have several public speakers signed up for today's hearing. We'll hear from them now.

We're going to go ahead and start with Pete Cisnicki, who is with us online.

[Speaker 44] (24:19 - 24:20)
Good to hear you there.

[Speaker 8] (24:23 - 27:27)
Yes, I'm here. My name is Pete Cisnicki from the 45th Ward. On March 21st, the discussion of the 3955 North Kilpatrick Plan Development unusually consumed an hour and a half of a three and a half hour Planning Commission meeting.

In that meeting, the commissioners, which includes five members of this committee, heard from the representative of Neighbors for Affordable Housing about the need for affordable housing on the northwest side, and the long, sad history of discrimination and segregation in the northwest side wards. The commissioners, to their credit, convinced the developer to build all 69 ARO units on site. Normally, it is a short jump from the Planning Commission to the Committee on Zoning, Landmarks, and Building Standards to approval in council.

3955 should have been approved by zoning on April 16th and by council on April 17th. April 16th came, and this committee deferred 3955 with its needed 69 affordable units. Then May 21st came, and this committee deferred 3955 with its needed 69 affordable units again.

And then June 11th came, and this committee deferred 3955 with its needed 69 affordable units for a fourth time. On June 12th, Natick newspapers reported that the hang-up was a project labor agreement, a PLA, which is a private agreement between two parties. The city is not a party to a PLA.

And today, this committee deferred 3955 with its needed 69 affordable units for a fourth time. Just yesterday, we saw Ed Burke sentenced to prison for, among other things, illegally exchanging zoning approval for things of substance, bribes, business, or clout. And today, I'm wondering if a local alder person, after four intervening zoning meetings, is not also withholding zoning approval illegally for things of substance, bribes, business, or clout, especially when that alder has a reported history of accepting bribes.

Having your cousin as a trade union vice president and illegally requiring a PLA as a condition of zoning approval certainly presents the appearance of impropriety, and Gardner's got all the impropriety he can handle already. The city is in negotiations now with HUD about the ongoing illegality of aldermanic prerogative, which HUD calls the local veto, and the part it plays in ongoing segregation which contributes to a lack of public safety. So today, I was asking that 3955 be finally approved, but I heard that an illegal quid pro quo, a local veto, will again lead to its deferral.

By limiting the availability of affordable housing, the local veto disproportionately harms Black and Hispanic households. The local veto perpetuates segregation. The local veto effectuates opposition to affordable housing based on racial animus.

The local veto.

[Speaker 1] (27:29 - 27:45)
Thank you, Mr. Siznicki. Next up, we have David Cenario, followed by Stephen Vance. At the mic.

Microphone is, sorry, right there.

[Speaker 22] (27:58 - 29:53)
Hello. Morning. Hi, my name is David Cenario, and I'm here about the development on Sheffield number 22474-T1.

I'm opposed to it because basically this is about displacement, and it is about destruction of the unique character of the neighborhood. In this case, we've got beautiful, over 100-year-old buildings that are going to be destroyed in order to put up another boxy eyesore, a pockmark on our beautiful city. Further, the tenants who are currently living there are going to be displaced.

They did not know about what was going to happen until they found a notice on their doors, and then they had to reach out for more information, which shows a fundamental disrespect towards the neighborhood, both the people living there and the character of the neighborhood. We've seen this throughout the city, tear down of historic buildings, beautiful buildings, to put up the cheapest, most cost-effective and profitable major buildings. And then finally, Alder Bennett has taken $10,000 from the realtor pack, and the landlord in this case is a major donor to that pack.

This shows a complete disregard towards the community in favor of money and predatory developers. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (29:55 - 29:59)
Thank you, sir. Next up is Stephen Vance, followed by John Sella.

[Speaker 15] (29:59 - 32:34)
Hello, members of the City Council Committee on Zoning Landmarks and Building Standards. My name is Stephen Vance. I'm a resident of the City of Chicago and an urban planner.

I've spoken to this committee multiple times this year about matters that affect how much housing gets approved to be built in the city. I reiterate my comment from your April 8th meeting about amending the zoning ordinance to ensure that the Zoning Board of Appeals can function when there are not enough board members. Nearly three months later, the ZBA is still incomplete.

The municipal code requires that the ZBA has five members and two alternates. Alternates fill in for members when they are unable to attend meetings due to illness or personal matters. In February, the ZBA was short two members, which may have led to the failure to approve a proposed shelter in Uptown, as proposals require three affirmative votes and the proposal only received two affirmative votes.

The ZBA having incomplete membership puts the timely approval of applications for special use and variations at risk, which materially jeopardizes new development, especially in matters involving new housing. Since that meeting, Mayor Johnson appointed two members, but only one, Adrian Soto, has been confirmed. The ZBA's current state of four members is bound to affect more projects.

I mentioned in April that at least two more shelter housing applications, which have support from the Department of Housing, are intending to be heard this year at ZBA, but those projects have yet to come before ZBA. The proponents of those shelters could be feeling forced to wait until the ZBA has a full membership or else suffer the same fate as the shelter that failed the ZBA in February. The Mayor and City Council should immediately take any reasonable steps within its authority to address housing and homelessness in the city, including prioritizing a fifth member.

Second, making pragmatic amendments to the code to allow alternates to sit in when there are fewer than five regular appointed ZBA members. Currently, the code allows alternates to sit in only for regular members who are missing that day. Third, the committee should advance Cut the Tape initiative, I believe it's number 67 here, which recommends revising zoning code requirement that requires all shelters and transitional housing developments to seek approval from Zoning Board of Appeals.

Move that closer to a situation that we know is as of right, that applies to most kinds of housing, so no longer would homeless shelters have to go through the burden of going before the Zoning Board of Appeals and potentially failing to be approved. I speak for many when I urge this committee to legalize housing and adopt changes to affect such a strategy. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (32:34 - 33:00)
Thank you, Mr. Vance. Next up, we have John Sellop followed by Danny Villalobos. Sir, go ahead and move the microphone closer.

Thanks, Oliver.

[Speaker 23] (33:07 - 34:48)
I'm protesting the rezoning on the addresses on Sheffield Street, 3627, 3633 North Sheffield. I believe the building should be constructed on a main street as opposed to residential housing and families. And I think that more attention should be given to the people that are living in the area.

It's basically a family-oriented children on the streets, people talking, discussing things. And I further protest because my property backs right up to the alley where this property is going to be built. And it's a five-story building, which is just going to discontinue what small rays of sun are penetrating through my area.

I don't really have anything further more to say because I think that it's a family-orientated area and this kind of construction really doesn't belong in that area. It should be on a main street. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (34:49 - 34:54)
Thank you, Mr. Sellop. Next up, we have Danny Villalobos followed by Zoe Lee.

[Speaker 11] (35:04 - 37:53)
Good morning. My name is Danny Villalobos, and I'm a resident of the Venom Park neighborhood on the southwest side of the city. I'm here to express my strong support for building over 4,000 new homes in high-demand areas through the projects on North Marcy, North LaSalle, West Chicago, North Aberdeen, South Michigan, and North Kingsbury.

You have to take into account that the zoning decisions made within these desirable neighborhoods have significant implications for all Chicagoans, especially for our most vulnerable working-class communities of color. Lincoln Park already has the tax base to reject developments and absorb the economic shock. It's Little Village and Pilsen that I'm worried about.

It's my neighborhood working-class community of Venom Park and Archer Heights that I'm concerned about. What happens to them? What you might think is a local issue over a local development affects the entire city.

Without these developments, we could only expect the bad policy decisions of downtown and Lincoln Park to reverberate across the city in the form of higher rents, weaker public services, and increased tax burden. And so, if you represent a desirable in-demand area of the city, like Lincoln Park, the Gold Coast, and Fulton Market, consider yourself honored, but also consider the responsibility you have to Chicago to support decisions that expand our city's tax base, attract businesses, and support working people. Our neighborhoods are incredibly linked.

Without these homes, the cost of living will continue to rise and undermine our city's global competitiveness. Projects like North Marcy and West Chicago are just the start, yet Alderman Wagesback wants to block North Marcy because it's too tall? For Chicago's best, bigger, taller housing development is the progressive proposition for business and justice.

We have to expand the skyline north and south and launch a construction boom of high-rises and skyscrapers across the entire lakefront. Call it disruptive, but we need mega-development for mega-impact to create the tax base for the future and bring spatial justice for the past. So, I encourage you to be bold, or at least do the bare minimum and approve these projects today.

Daniel LaSpada, Brendan Riley, Timmy Knudson, Bill Conway, Brian Hopkins, Bennett Lawson, you represent some of the most in-demand areas of the city, but will you represent the broad interest of Chicago or the interest of one alderman with the privilege to let Chicago down once again? Thank you for your time.

[Speaker 1] (37:53 - 37:58)
Thank you, Mr. Villalobos. Next up is Zoe Lee, followed by James Anderson.

[Speaker 14] (38:01 - 40:45)
As you know, the most powerful politician was sentenced yesterday to two years, a $2 million fine, and he got away with a lot of stuff for 50 years. That's because, you know, it wasn't as much technology as it is now. So, to say that is, y'all are not going to get away with anything if y'all don't find the money for my mother's building.

Now, I have this wrecking permit, right? It's $500, and the city of Chicago unlawfully demolished my building, but it says the owner is city of Chicago, and that's crazy because my family has owned that building since 1972. The city of Chicago never owned that building.

So, a lot of the non-Black aldermen in here always ask me, what can they do to help, right? Because the Black aldermens, the majority of them don't even show up to work anymore because they've done so much from our communities. I need someone to go to the buildings department, Marlene Hopkins or the deputy commissioner.

I need someone to go to Maurice Robinson, Jason Lee, Kim Roberts, and I want someone to ask, why did the city of Chicago think they own that building? If they have no deed, if they have no permit, if they have no deed at all. We have the deed.

The deed has been in the Chicago Land and Trust since 1972. So, that's the question. Why did the city of Chicago feel like they own that building?

That's the question that no one has the answer to. When you go to the Black people that's in here and ask, they come to me and they say, building violations. When you go to, when I look at my federal lawsuit and the transcripts, Bradley Wilson says, we were under the impression, your honor, that the city owned the building.

That makes no sense because that's how corrupt Chicago is and that's how y'all steal our buildings. So, I need someone to ask, why did the city of Chicago think they own my building that we have the deed to and have had the deed to since 1972? Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (40:45 - 40:50)
Thank you. I'm next is James Anderson followed by Taiwan Sims.

[Speaker 10] (41:00 - 43:59)
My name is James, middle initial R, last name Anderson, and I'm here this morning to speak in favor of a viable city for the mid-21st century. Specifically, Mr. Chairman, I urge the committee to support the development proposals for 1840 North Marcy Street, 700 West Chicago Avenue, 345 North Aberdeen Street, 2328 South Michigan Avenue, and 2031 North Kingsbury Street, some of which have been deferred from today's agenda. These proposals, all told, represent 4,240 housing units, a start on the hundreds of thousands of units Chicago will need in the coming decades as migrants and displaced persons settle in and have families and as climate refugees from parts of the country that have become unlivable start to arrive.

The rust belt will rise again. I wish to use my time allotment to address the objections that I hear as I attend community meetings about these proposals. The honorable members of this committee have heard it all.

Too much traffic, not enough parking, too much parking, not affordable enough, too affordable, too much density, too high, too blocky, who's going to want to live there? And the granddaddy of them all, it's contrary to the character of the neighborhood. Mr. Chairman, taken individually, each one of these objections is ridiculous and doesn't withstand the merest scrutiny. But taken collectively, when they come at you and the other council members like a firehose at community meetings, they reveal what the objectors are really against. Change. Let's take the Marcy Street proposal, for example, because many of the objectors have indicated that they've lived in the area for 40 years.

Nostalgia is a powerful emotion. The mid-1980s were a wonderful time. These folks were young.

Harold was the mayor. The Bears were great. And they had an apartment in Lincoln Park for $300.

If only everything could stay the same. But time marches on. Their youth isn't coming back.

Harold isn't coming back. The Bears may not be great again in our lifetimes. And the needs of Chicago have changed.

Industry has changed. Family size has gotten smaller. And the idea of a car-dominated landscape from the mid-20th century has given way to an understanding that that will destroy our city, not save it.

There has been substantial objection to everything. If it had been up to these people, Chicago never would have been built in the first place. But everything that does get built turns out to be okay.

Many of the objectors to the 1600 North LaSalle Street proposal that you've heard about live in buildings that previous naysayers objected to. For heaven's sake, there are lights at Wrigley Field. And the world has not come to an end.

Mr. Chairman, we must not live in the past, even though the past was a glorious time. I urge you and the committee to support the residential developments on the agenda today and as others come before you to think about the needs of our city's future.

[Speaker 1] (44:01 - 44:13)
Thank you. Next up, Tawan Sims, followed by Patrick Grossi. We also have Alderman Ramirez Rosso here for quorum.

Proceed.

[Speaker 12] (44:14 - 47:16)
Good morning. Good morning, committee. So, when I say four or five months ago, I came in here and spoke about the day I was shot in stomach.

That would have been August 24th, 2023. I gave the event number JG396151. Since then, I've been doing my due diligence to get the FOIA request.

I FOIAed it up. The FOIA request number is P951699. Got the FOIA, some vague report, and then stonewalled once again.

Told that I cannot get the body-worn camera nor the OMC call, neither anything, because there's an ongoing investigation. After that, I went over to the 5th District, if that's what it is, on 111th and spoke with a doerty. Not only that, I spoke with a supposed investigating detective, Williams.

Stonewalled again. I can't imagine why I'm not allowed to get the FOIA request, at least, so that I can hear myself being shot, because I was on a police call with, I was on the call phone with the police when it happened. Also, I can't imagine why I'm not allowed the body-worn camera or any of these things, but I'm stonewalled.

Because I'm sure that the public would like to witness something like that or just hear it, the event happening in real time, because I want to sit and understand exactly why no one was arrested, yet they was on the scene. And I was told by the gentleman that, hey, that's not how the law works. However, when my mother, when I was arrested January 14th, 2021, taken out of my mother's house while she was crippled nearly, I thought that's not how to, I was just supposed or alleged.

And still, I was taken away from her. She dead now. So, I want to understand how the law works when it comes to Black Americans versus everyone else.

I want to understand why my FOIA request is denied, and I'm told that I have to file a lawsuit in the circuit courts for an event that took place that I have suffered. I suffered being shot in the stomach. And then when you read the report, it's like, oh, it was a graze wound.

No, it wasn't a graze wound, because I can distinctly tell you that I felt the bullet go into my abdomen and slide out of my abdomen. Lucky I'm still here. But I suffered that event, but I'm still denied the materials in which I requested.

Freedom of Information Act is what it's called. However, I've been stonewalled. And I want to understand why.

I want to understand why the law works in a certain way or fashion for others, but still with us, it's like, fuck us. Forgive my words. I want to understand it.

But you all are the legislative body. So, I'm sure you all can give me answers or help me to get answers, right? Being a committee.

And this zone, this took place at, sorry, 45 West 100 and the Third Street, the Imperial Hotel.

[Speaker 1] (47:17 - 47:22)
Thank you, Mr. Simms. Next up, we have Patrick Grossi, followed by George Blakemore.

[Speaker 16] (47:42 - 50:20)
Good morning. My name is Patrick Grossi, and I'm speaking today on behalf of Preservation Chicago, wishing to speak to 3627 to 3633 North Sheffield. Preservation Chicago was disappointed, frankly, to learn of the proposed demolition of these properties along North Sheffield.

As an organization, we typically strive to be supportive of sensitive development. We rarely oppose zoning amendments. We rarely get in the way of desired increases in density.

Here, however, we would argue more caution must be taken. At minimum, we would encourage a design approach that at least retains the historic facades, as was seemingly done at 3636 North Sheffield, a neighboring property. 3731 North Sheffield also models an approach here.

There, a historic property was retained, while new residential construction was introduced in the side yard to the north. And more to the point, cities across the country have tried in vain to recreate the Wrigley experience, an early 20th century ballpark, second oldest in the country, nestled amidst a thriving early 20th century built environment. The view sheds from Wrigley were, in fact, integral to the landmarking of the ballpark in 2004, and more recent designation as a National Historic Landmark, the highest designation a property can receive from the National Park Service.

Other cities offer a sort of Disney-fied version of this experience at best. We have the real McCoy. We shouldn't discard it.

And this is, unfortunately, yet another example of the shortcomings of the City of Chicago's demolition delay ordinance. 3633 North Sheffield is green-rated in the Chicago Historic Resource Survey. However, that's a document that's now over 30 years old.

Neighboring properties at 3621, 3639, 3651 are all orange-rated, which would at least trigger demolition review. Arguably, any building in the city over 50 years of age should trigger some form of demolition review, ensuring that we don't discard the assets we may not even realize we already have, to say nothing of the wasteful practice of demolition of perfectly viable occupied buildings. So Preservation Chicago thanks you for your consideration.

As always, we're happy to discuss and meet with the development team to find a mutually beneficial outcome here, an alternative approach. And again, we have the real McCoy in Chicago, something that other American cities lust after. Let's not discard it.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (50:20 - 50:24)
Thank you. George Blakemore, followed by Lisa Sorenson.

[Speaker 13] (50:25 - 53:27)
The minutes still alive. The history of the zoning committee. It's pay to play.

It's another dog and pony show. And it's typical Chicago way. Felice, I've been coming down here about 30, 40 years, used to sit here.

Rolled it down, that's his chair. But he was fighting Emma Mitch. And now they have this Mr. Lawson, whatever. It's something else down here. Pay to play. The most corrupt city in America.

The most corrupt. Well, how would you, what's your criteria for making this statement? The elected officials are constantly being indicted and put in jail.

The black ones, the white ones, the Hispanic ones, the Asians, all corrupt. A one party system. And the reason they can get away with this, the people are not involved in government.

Now, just two years before, well, one crook turned another one in. The one that turned him in, when is he going to jail? He's a crook too.

They all are crooked. The system is broken. This is not a democracy where you have multi-parties and different opinions.

It's worse than communist China. It is a corrupt system. All of these people here are Democrats.

Democrats. It is a cesspool of corruption here. The black ones, the white ones, the Asians, the Hispanics, all the same.

And they're not working in the interest of the citizens. Because you, the citizens, allow this. Don't point to these ultimates.

Look in the mirror. You are the enemy. You make the city corrupt.

There's something wrong with you, me, us, and we to allow this. Now, that's another corrupt one right here, Walter Burnett, another criminal. You can even be a criminal and be elected official.

It's something evil here. And they never own time. They own black folks' time.

So you white folks, you're terrible. You black folks, you're terrible. You Asians, you Hispanics, birds of a feather flock together.

So you deserve the government you get. And you get the government you deserve. You get the city of Chicago preservation kind of landmark.

Uh-uh. They don't do nothing but it's the exterior, the interior.

[Speaker 1] (53:29 - 54:02)
Thank you, Mr. Blakemore. Angela Clay has requested to attend the meeting by remote means under provisions of Rule 59, although La Spada makes a motion to approve Alder Clay's request. All in favor, say aye.

Any opposed, say nay. We need to make sure the ayes have it. We also have Alderperson Fuentes here for quorum.

Anyone else I'm missing? Great. We have Lisa Sorenson, followed by Sue Saraswat.

Will be our final speaker.

[Speaker 44] (54:09 - 54:09)
Ms. Sorenson?

[Speaker 9] (54:17 - 57:12)
Hi. My name is Lisa Sorenson, and I am here in opposition of the 3627 to 3633 North Sheffield Rezoning Project. I am representing the majority of the Lakeview neighbors who oppose this project and wish to save the three iconic Wrigleyville buildings that have been there standing over 123 years, and they are visible from Wrigleyfield's viewshed.

I've been a resident of the 3700 block of North Wilton, one block east of the ballpark, and these buildings for 18 years, and I've owned in Lakeview since 1998. I believe that Alderman Lawson has been hiding this project and only introduced it to the East Lakeview Neighborhood Association meeting in February and March to a small audience in February and about 60 members in March. Many of us can't make it to that meeting due to work, and many have children as well.

I wrote his office after reading about it in Crain's Chicago Business on March 25th and asked for a separate meeting for the neighbors that I would organize and receive no reply. You'll see that email in the book I passed. I started a change.org petition on June 10th after seeing the public notice up on one of the buildings that was mentioned earlier where the tenants were informed that they would be having a significant rent increase to be rumored at $4,000 from their current $2,400 rent. So since I launched this petition, it has over 2,300 signatures, and the majority of them do come from within Alderman Lawson's zip code. I also did include in the binder comments from not only the change.org petition which has about 70 comments to save those historic buildings, but also I included the comments from the Lakeview News Uncensored Facebook group that have a significant amount of comments as well that they had no idea this was going on. Every single person I encountered had no idea of this project or the rezoning project.

So what I really want you all to do is to consider this rezone and the historic relevance of these buildings, and they really should honestly be landmarked themselves and not demoed. Thank you for your time.

[Speaker 1] (57:13 - 57:16)
Thank you, Ms. Sorensen. Our final speaker is Sud Saraswat.

[Speaker 17] (57:21 - 59:51)
Hi, everyone. Good morning. So I'll get the basics out of the way.

My name is Sud. I'm a homeowner here in Chicago, and I am in support of the developments at Marcy as well as the other ones that both Jim and Danny mentioned previously. Back in March, I read an article on WGN's website which highlighted that Illinois is now the least tax-friendly state in the entire country.

So of all 50 states, we rank the lowest. We have a giant F-minus compared to everybody else. In our discussions about these developments, we get swayed sometimes by commentary about parking, traffic, aesthetics, community change, whatever.

But the big elephant in the room and the only elephant in the room or the only thing that really matters are state and city finances, right? As Chicago goes, because we are half the population of the state, so we go, the state goes. I want to point something out here, and I'll speak directly to the homeowners in this room and online who are advocating against these developments.

Chicago has no natural advantages. We do not have year-round good weather. We do not have a booming tech industry or more jobs than we know what to do with, like in other places.

What we do have is that we are the last big city in the country that is still moderately affordable. When you vote against new developments, you are playing a very, very dangerous game. Our tax burden is massive already, and it's only going to get worse as pension obligations become more pronounced.

If you make Chicago expensive, then we lose our last natural advantage. Let me remind you, a city in decline that doesn't build to accommodate new people will only impact you, the homeowners. Renters can leave.

Businesses can leave. People can go find cheap housing and good jobs somewhere else like they do right now. The only people left holding the bag, the people who will have to bear the burden of all those taxes will be us, the property owners.

We need these developments to spread the tax burden across more people. If you make the city new, exciting, and affordable, people will come. If you do not, be aware that you are stealing from your future self.

Every vote no on new development now is an automatic tax increase on yourself in the future. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (59:52 - 1:01:47)
Thank you, sir. That concludes our public comment period. We will now move on to the agenda.

First matter up is the re-referral of document number 02024-0010037. Under Rule 37, the Committee on Zoning Landmarks and Building Standards does not have jurisdiction over this ordinance. Therefore, it should properly be re-referred to the Committee on Transportation and Public Way.

Can I have a motion to re-refer? Alder Fuentes makes the motion. All in favor, say aye.

All opposed, say nay. The ayes have it, and the ordinance is re-referred to the Committee on Transportation and Public Way. Next up, we have large signs over 100 square feet in area, 24 feet above grade.

We will hear them all together. I will read the ward followed by the address and then take a motion at the end. Two signs in the 27th ward located at 360 North Green Street.

Two signs in the 32nd ward located at 1601 North Milwaukee Avenue. One sign in the 41st ward located at 7159 West Higgins Road. Three signs in the 42nd ward located at 550 North State Street.

Lastly, one sign in the 42nd ward located at 70 East Walton Street. If there's no questions by Committee members, Alderman Riley moves to pass. All in favor, say aye.

All opposed, say nay. The ayes have it, and the orders are passed. We'll now move on to the map amendments in an effort to ensure the Committee meeting runs smoothly.

Items are grouped together according to witness. We'll be heard in that order rather than ward order. If we have any witnesses, we'll have them sit right here today.

First up, at the bottom of page one, document number 22471-T1 in the 43rd ward. Ordinance referred, 52224. Common address is 1854 North Howe Street.

Change request is an RM 4.5 residential multi-unit district to RM 4.5 residential multi-unit district. We have Attorney Sarah Barnes.

[Speaker 6] (1:01:49 - 1:02:48)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and esteemed members of the Committee. Once more, for the record, my name is Sarah Barnes, and I'm an attorney with Gozducky Law here today on behalf of the applicant 18, or sorry, PH Chicago LLC. This is a little bit of a unique situation.

We are actually not seeking to reclassify the underlying zoning classification. We are going to retain the RM 4.5 residential multi-unit district, but we are doing a voluntary type one zoning map amendment application with a request for a variation for one of the side yard setbacks because we're on a substandard lot. And the reason we are routing it through Committee and doing it as a type one is to provide some assurances, additional assurances for the community.

[Speaker 1] (1:02:48 - 1:02:56)
Just one second, Ms. Barnes. Sergeant-at-Arms, we can hear what's happening in the lobby all the way up here. You could close the door or have your lap.

Thank you. Sorry. Please proceed.

[Speaker 6] (1:02:56 - 1:03:59)
No, it's okay. And it's to provide us some additional assurances for the community that what is being proposed, which is a standard size single family residence is actually going to be built and something larger and out of scale with that community will not be built there. So that's the reason for the type one zoning map amendment.

Again, it is to allow for the construction of a new single family residence that is keeping in exact character of this very charming Lincoln Park neighborhood. Towards those ends, we met with Alderman Knudsen, who was very involved in encouraging community engagement. We also met several times with the Lincoln Central Association, many of which live on this street, to come up with the programming for the site.

And I believe that all are in support and Alderman Knudsen is here, but he also did issue a letter of support.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:00 - 1:04:03)
Yes. Thank you, Ms. Barnes. Alderman Knudsen, did you want to add a little?

[Speaker 37] (1:04:03 - 1:04:45)
Yeah, I can just say on this one, there was a, yeah, there was a good process. At first, there were several people in the community, including the Neighborhood Association that were opposed to this type of zoning shift. So we just kind of sat everyone down at a table at Marquee Lounge, everyone chatted it out.

And what they learned was by right, the project could be taller than it will be under this zoning shift. So it was a good teaching moment of process. I want to thank Sarah Barnes for doing that teaching.

And it got most of the community and it got the Neighborhood Association in support. So we're in support and thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:45 - 1:05:17)
Great. Thank you. Any questions by committee members?

Hearing none, Alderman Dowell, moves do pass. All in favor, say aye. Any opposed, say nay.

Seeing the Chair, the ayes have it and the item is passed. Top of page two is document number 22455 in the 32nd Ward, ordinance referred 52224. Common address is 1313 West Wrightwood Avenue.

Change request, C11, Neighborhood Commercial District to RT4, residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district. Once again, we have Sarah Barnes.

[Speaker 6] (1:05:18 - 1:06:29)
Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman and esteemed members of the committee. Once more, just for the record, my name is Sarah Barnes and I'm an attorney with Gosecki Law. I'm happy to be here this morning on behalf of the applicant, Jim Now Development LLC.

This is a standard type two zoning map amendment application in order to change the underlying zoning classification out of what has become kind of an obsolete commercial zoning district and into a more compatible residential zoning district. The proposal calls for the construction of a new three-story with basement, three-unit condominium building with detached garage, which will have parking for three vehicles, one for each unit. The programming was specifically designed with the community to reflect the character of the existing improvements in the neighborhood.

Towards that end, we did work with the adjacent neighbors and the community, as well as Alderman Wagesback towards the programming for this project, and I believe that Alderman Wagesback has provided a letter of support.

[Speaker 1] (1:06:29 - 1:06:34)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Wagesback. Any questions by community members? Alderman Reilly?

[Speaker 30] (1:06:36 - 1:06:42)
Thank you, Chairman. Because Alderman Wagesback supports this zoning change, I move to pass.

[Speaker 1] (1:06:43 - 1:07:11)
Great. No other questions? Seeing none, Alderman Reilly moves to pass.

All in favor, say aye. Any opposed, say nay. The ayes have it.

We'll be reported out. Next item is document number 22472-T1 in the 32nd Ward. Ordinance referred 52224.

Common address is 3327-35 North Lincoln Avenue. Change request, B33 Community Shopping District to B33 Community Shopping District. Once again, Sarah Barnes.

[Speaker 6] (1:07:12 - 1:08:04)
Thank you. Once more, Mr. Chairman and esteemed members of the committee, for the last time today, my name is Sarah Barnes, and I'm an attorney with Goethe Law here this morning on behalf of the applicant 3327 North Lincoln, Comet LLC. Just prior to this hearing today, we discovered that the roof access structure, this is a through lot, so there's kind of interesting property lines.

It needs to be reoriented slightly in order to take it out of the required front setback for roof cappings structures. So in an effort to do that, since this is a type one zoning map amendment, I would ask that this be deferred to a date certain of July 16th, 2024, so that we can make that accommodation.

[Speaker 1] (1:08:04 - 1:08:17)
Great. Alderman Conway makes a motion to defer the previously read item to the date certain on July 16th of this year. All in favor, say aye.

Any opposed, say nay. The ayes have it, the item is deferred.

[Speaker 45] (1:08:18 - 1:08:18)
Thank you, Ms. Barnes.

[Speaker 1] (1:08:19 - 1:08:41)
All right, top of page three, document number 22451-T1 in the 49th Ward, ordinance referred 52224. Common address is 1415 West Morse Avenue. Change request, B23, Neighborhood Mixed Use District, to B23, Neighborhood Mixed Use District.

We have attorney Rolando Acosta.

[Speaker 3] (1:08:42 - 1:10:08)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant. The subject property is improved with a four-story building that contains 14 dwelling units. This property was previously rezoned back in 2021 to allow for a rear addition to the building that would contain 16 dwelling units connected to the front.

The front building stays effectively the same, this is just a rear addition. Subsequent to that rezoning, we also secured variations from the Zoning Board of Appeals for a rear yard setback and for a reduction in loading berths. This property is 145 feet from the Morse Avenue redline station, so it's significantly TOD.

Because of the time lapse, the variations specifically have elapsed, so this rezoning is being sought merely to re-establish those variations. And again, there are two of them. There is the reduction in the rear yard setback from 30 feet to 10 feet, a reduction in the loading berths from one, required loading berths to zero, and a reduction in parking spaces from 15 to nine.

With that, we had community meetings initially, and it was supported by the Alderman then, and this is just a redo of the same thing we're doing. So I believe Alderman Hatton has communicated her support.

[Speaker 1] (1:10:09 - 1:10:45)
We have heard from Alderman Hatton who is in support of this item. Do we have any questions by committee members? Seeing none, Alderman Fuentes moves to pass.

All in favor say aye. All opposed say nay. The Chair of the Ayes have it, the item is passed.

Next up is document number 22463-T1 in the 49th Ward, ordinance referred 52224, common address 7325 through 31 North Honoré Street. Change requests an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit to RM6 residential multi-unit district. Rolando Acosta.

[Speaker 3] (1:10:46 - 1:12:20)
Once again, Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant. Good morning. This property is improved with the three-story building built in the 1920s containing 26 residential dwelling units, no parking.

It is a typical Chicago courtyard building built to the property lines and almost to the front property lines. There is currently vacant space in the lower level of this building that could accommodate four additional units. So we are proposing and seeking this rezoning so that we can in fact build out those spaces to add the four units.

We had a community meeting on this matter per Alderman Hatton's procedure and it was favorably recommended by the community, hence it is favorably, I believe, recommended by the Alderman. There are two administrative adjustments that are part of this type one rezoning. The first is to reduce the required parking spaces for the four units from four to zero.

This property is transit served location to the Clark Street and Rogers bus lines. It's also within the required distance at 1,900 feet from the Jarvis train station. In addition, we seek a second administrative adjustment authorizing the relocation of the open space from the rear of this property to the courtyard.

The required open space here is 144 square feet. The courtyard contains 2,141 square feet, so more than plenty, and meets all the dimensional requirements. With that, we ask for your committee's favorable recommendation.

[Speaker 1] (1:12:21 - 1:12:55)
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Acosta. Any questions by committee members?

Seeing none, Alderman Ramirez-Rosa moves do pass. All in favor, say aye. Any opposed, say nay.

Seeing the chair, the ayes have it. The item is passed. Thank you.

On the top of four, document number 22444-T1 in the second ward. Ordinance referred 52224. Common address is 1528 Northwest Sal Drive.

Change request. RM5, residential multi-unit district to B25, neighborhood mixed-use district. We have Rolando Acosta.

[Speaker 3] (1:12:55 - 1:13:49)
Once again, Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant. This seems to be a day for rear additions to existing buildings. So, this is another existing building.

It's a four-story building containing four residential dwelling units. It has a graveled area in the rear that is used as three parking spaces, although it is non-compliant because of the paving of it. The proposal is to add a fifth-story addition to the front building and build a fifth five-floor addition at the rear of the property to create a total of eight units within the property, add three parking spaces to the rear of the property properly surfaced, according to the zoning ordinance.

A community meeting was held here under the auspices of Alderman Hopkins. There were no objections really voiced at that community meeting. I believe the Alderman is here, or at least the staff is here, to express their support.

[Speaker 1] (1:13:50 - 1:13:56)
Yes, thank you. Alderman Hopkins was here but had to step out. We have Brian Pellerin from the second ward office.

Brian?

[Speaker 32] (1:13:56 - 1:14:25)
Thank you. Yes, Brian Pellerin, for the record, staff assistant to Alderman Hopkins. Alderman Hopkins is in support of this project.

As Rolando mentioned, we had a very well-attended community meeting on this matter and another matter. There were no objections to this project and the owner is working closely with neighbors regarding a large old tree in the yard and making them whole in that process. So, Alderman Hopkins asks for this committee's favorable consideration.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:14:26 - 1:14:48)
Are there any questions by committee members? Seeing none, oh, I'm sorry, Alderman Dowell. Okay, not on this, but on a, okay.

Do you want to make a motion? Alderman Dowell makes the motion do pass. All in favor, say aye.

All opposed, say nay. Seeing the Chair, the ayes have it. The item is passed.

Alderman Dowell.

[Speaker 34] (1:14:49 - 1:15:12)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I know that we've done 1415 West Morris. I just wanted to ask Rolando, I know the original ordinance in 2021 had an ARO requirement.

I noticed in this one, you are increasing the number of dwelling units. So, does that trigger some additional affordable units?

[Speaker 3] (1:15:12 - 1:15:45)
So, actually, Alderwoman, we are not increasing the number of from what was approved in 2021. This ordinance for 1415 is merely to reestablish the variations that were secured from the Zoning Board of Appeals. The original type one rezoning, the parameters of that remain the same.

And so, per the ARO, the 2021 ARO does not apply because it's not, it does not trigger what is termed and defined as an entitlement. We are, however, providing two affordable units in the building for the 2015 ARO.

[Speaker 34] (1:15:46 - 1:15:49)
Okay. Thank you. I just wanted to get that on the record.

Absolutely.

[Speaker 3] (1:15:49 - 1:15:49)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:15:52 - 1:15:53)
That's it, right?

[Speaker 3] (1:15:53 - 1:15:55)
No. Oh, well, I'm replacing Jimena.

[Speaker 1] (1:15:55 - 1:16:12)
Oh, you're replacing Jimena. All right. Document number 22458 in the 12th Ward.

Ordinance referred 52224. Common address is 3842 South Hermitage Avenue. Change request is RS3, residential single unit district to an RM 4.5, residential multi-unit district. Once again, Rolando Acosta.

[Speaker 3] (1:16:13 - 1:16:58)
My apologies for replacing Jimena with the less lively mean. So, but it made it easier for her to stay home with the child. The, this bill, this proposal is contained, is for a property that has a three and a half story building on the property.

It contains two legal residential dwelling units and two illegal residential dwelling units. The proposal is to rezone the property so that we can legalize the two illegal units and make other repairs to the property. There was a fire on the, on the premises that need to be repaired.

We did go through a community process with the Alderwoman. I believe her staff has communicated her support for this matter to the committee and I'm happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (1:16:58 - 1:17:04)
Okay. Thank you. We do have the support from Alderwoman Ramirez.

I know she was here. She probably just stepped out. Alderman LaSpada.

[Speaker 19] (1:17:05 - 1:17:16)
Thank you. Thank you so much, Chair. Rolando, just curious and supportive and would be glad to make the motion after my question.

Um, where, where are the, the units located that we're legalizing?

[Speaker 3] (1:17:17 - 1:17:22)
Pardon me? So there's one in what would be the attic and one that would be what, in what would be the basement or the lowest level.

[Speaker 19] (1:17:23 - 1:17:29)
Got it, got it, got it. Love it. It makes me think critically about the ordinance that we're going to be passing very quickly.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:17:30 - 1:17:45)
Thank you. Any other questions by committee members? Alderwoman Cruz is here for purposes of quorum.

Seeing none, Alderman LaSpada makes the motion to do pass. All in favor say aye. Any opposed say nay.

Seeing that the ayes have it, item is passed.

[Speaker 3] (1:17:45 - 1:17:45)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:17:46 - 1:18:07)
Thank you. Bottom of page four is document number 22456 of the 48th Ward. Ordinance referred 52224.

Common address is 5221 to 5259 North Broadway. Change request, B13 neighborhood shopping district to B33 community shopping district. We have attorney Tyler Manick.

[Speaker 5] (1:18:08 - 1:19:38)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Tyler Manick. I'm an attorney with Shane Banks, Kenny and Schwartz.

I'm also the attorney for the owner and applicant, the Chody Family R3LP, which owns 5221 to 5259 North Broadway. The property is currently improved with a commercial shopping center containing three single story commercial buildings with a total of 46,314 square feet of commercial space. The applicant is finishing up renovations to the shopping centers under lease for 1,324 square feet of space to sploot a veterinary clinic The property is currently zoned B13, which does not allow for a veterinary use.

As a result, the applicant is here proposing a zoning map amendment to rezone the shopping center from a B13 neighborhood shopping district to a B33 community shopping district. The applicant successfully went through the 48th Ward zoning change and development process. Based on the demand for veterinary services in this area, the 48th Ward Zoning Advisory Council and Alderwoman each support this application.

I know that she's present here, but a letter of support was tendered to the committee. Therefore, I respectfully request this committee's favorable recommendation to pass the zoning map amendment rezoning 5221 to 5259 North Broadway to a B33 community shopping district, and I'd be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (1:19:39 - 1:19:42)
Thank you. Alderwoman Mina Hoppenworth, do you want to add?

[Speaker 27] (1:19:44 - 1:19:57)
Thank you so much, Tyler. Thank you, Chair. This is going to add so much to the community.

We definitely need these veterinary services in the area, and I ask for this committee's favorable consideration.

[Speaker 1] (1:19:58 - 1:20:31)
Thank you so much. Any other questions by committee members? Seeing none, Alderman Hopkins moves do pass.

All in favor, say aye. Any opposed, say nay. The chair, the ayes have it.

The item is passed. At the top of page 5 is document number 22450T1 in the 47th Ward, ordinance referred 52224. Common address is 2600 West Montrose.

Change request, B32 community shopping district to B25 neighborhood mixed-use district. Attorney Tyler Manick.

[Speaker 5] (1:20:32 - 1:22:01)
Thank you again, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. Again, my name is Tyler Manick, attorney with Champaign's Kenyon Shorts, and the attorney for the applicant and owner of 2600 West Montrose. The property is improved with a three-story plus basement mixed-use building containing 25 dwelling units and a 712 square foot office unit.

Other than the one dwelling unit and 712 square feet of office space on the ground floor, the ground floor is predominantly unused storage space. The applicant seeks a zoning map amendment from B32 to B25 to convert the storage space into three separate dwelling units and a bike room. The current building is legal nonconforming with no parking.

It is a transit serve location due to its proximity to the Rockwell Brown Line station at Montrose Bus Line Corridor. This application seeks, in addition to the rezoning, an administrative adjustment to maintain the zero parking for the three new units as a transit serve location. The applicant participated in the 47th Ward zoning and development process, including meeting with the Alderman's Zoning Advisory Board.

Through that process, Alderman Martin has kindly given my client a letter of support for this request. With the support of Alderman Martin, I respectfully request this committee's recommendation of the zoning map amendment to rezone 2600 West Montrose, and I'd be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (1:22:01 - 1:22:06)
Thank you. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Martin. Any other questions?

Alderman Espada?

[Speaker 19] (1:22:07 - 1:22:27)
Thank you so much. Tyler, I'm just curious, based off of either additional development, investment in the building as a whole, or the ADU ordinance, or ARO unit ordinance, do any of these result in any of the new units being affordable or income limited? How is that playing out?

[Speaker 5] (1:22:28 - 1:22:39)
No, this is strictly a zoning map amendment without falling under the ARO. I don't think it also complies with the ADU ordinance, whether the current form or the new form.

[Speaker 19] (1:22:40 - 1:22:42)
Okay, just curious. Thank you, sir. Thank you, Tyler.

[Speaker 1] (1:22:43 - 1:23:09)
Thank you. Any other questions? Seeing none, Alderman Knudsen moves do pass.

All in favor, say aye. Opposed, say nay. The Chair, the ayes have it.

The item is passed. Next is document number 22449 in the 32nd Ward, ordinance referred 52224. Common address is 2200 North Ashland Avenue, change request C11, Neighborhood Commercial District to C21, Motor Vehicle Related District.

We have attorney Tyler Manick.

[Speaker 5] (1:23:10 - 1:24:26)
Again, good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Tyler Manick. I'm an attorney for the Applicant Pup Social Chicago LLC.

The property is improved with a single-story commercial building containing 10,761 square feet. It's commonly recognized around the area as the Green Dolphin former lounge. The applicant seeks to operate under a lease in 5,981 square feet of this building, a dog grooming and retail dog supplies membership-based business.

As part of its business, the applicant intends to offer their members and dogs an outdoor recreation area. Under the current C11 zoning, outdoor uses are prohibited of this type. To allow for the outdoor dog park, the applicant requires this rezoning to a C21 zoning district.

The applicant has worked extensively with Alderman Wagesbeck and his staff about this application. These plans were shared with the Bucktown Community Organization and North Branch Works as well. With Alderman Wagesbeck's support, I respectfully request this committee's recommendation to rezone 2200 North Ashland to a C21 zoning district and be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (1:24:26 - 1:24:29)
Thank you. We do have a lot of support from Alderman Wagesbeck. Alderman Riley?

[Speaker 30] (1:24:31 - 1:24:35)
Thank you, Chairman. Because Alderman Wagesbeck supports this zoning change, I move to pass.

[Speaker 1] (1:24:35 - 1:25:07)
Great. Seeing no other questions, Alderman Riley moves to do pass. All in favor, say aye.

All opposed, say nay. The Chair, the ayes have it. The item is passed.

Thank you, Mr. Manick. Next up is document number 22468-T1 in the 48th Ward, ordinance referred 52224. Common address is 5920 North Ridge Avenue.

Change request, C12, Neighborhood Commercial District, to B25, Neighborhood Mixed-Use District. We have Attorney Nick Fitikas.

[Speaker 2] (1:25:07 - 1:25:45)
Thank you. Thank you, Chairman. For the record again, Nick Fitikas from the Law Offices of Sam Banks.

I'm here on behalf of the applicant and property owner, Mabel 5920 LLC. The applicant is proposing a zoning change in order to allow the establishment of 17 new grade-level residential units. The existing building currently contains 52 dwelling units above grade, and all of those units will remain.

We did work directly with the Alderman's office and participated in a community meeting for this project, and I believe we do have a letter of support from the Alderman on file. I'd be happy to answer any questions you or your board members have about the project.

[Speaker 1] (1:25:45 - 1:25:50)
Thank you. We do have a letter of support, but I think she'd probably like to say a word. Alderman Menah Hoppenworth.

[Speaker 27] (1:25:50 - 1:26:56)
Thank you so much, Nick. This is such an exciting project. This is very close to the new Metro Ridge Station right by Sun High School.

This is a gateway to Edgewater in an area that has been very much disinvested for a long time. There's a, the bike grid has been extended on Clark Street, and this is going to be a fantastic opportunity for people in our area to access affordable housing that's accessible, that is electric at the center of the development, and will bring more art into the community. So I thank you for this.

This is going to be incredible for our economic corridors, very close to Andersonville, and also walking distance away from Broadway. So I thank you for this project and your work, Envoy Nate Ernest and Corey Faulkner for bringing this development to the 48th Ward. I ask for this committee's favorable approval of this development.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:26:56 - 1:27:38)
Thank you, Alderman Menah Hoppenworth. It's nice having you with us today as a non-committee member. Any questions by committee members at all?

Seeing none, Vice Mayor Burnett moves do pass. All in favor, say aye. Any opposed, say nay.

Let me make sure the ayes have it, and the item is passed. Congrats. It's an exciting project.

Well, we're not going far. All right. Top of page six is document number 22469, also in the 48th Ward.

Ordinance referred 52224. Common address is 1464 West Farragut. Change request is an RS3, residential single unit district, to RT4, residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district.

We have Attorney Nick Patekis.

[Speaker 2] (1:27:39 - 1:28:26)
Thank you again, Chairman Nick Patekis, for the record. And I am here on behalf of the individual condominium unit owners at the subject property. The requested zoning change would permit a two-story rear addition to the subject building.

The existing structure is already over the floor area ratio for the underlying RS3 district. The proposed district would allow or encompass the proposed addition. But the property will remain a two-unit residential property going forward.

We also, in working with the alderman's office, have agreed to downzone the property back to RS3 once proper permits are obtained in order to maintain a consistent zoning map. I'd be happy to answer any questions you or your board members have about the project.

[Speaker 1] (1:28:26 - 1:28:29)
Thank you, Mr. Patekis. Alderman, did you want to add to this?

[Speaker 27] (1:28:31 - 1:28:34)
I ask for the committee's favorable consideration. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:28:34 - 1:29:08)
Sweet. I love it. Any questions by committee members?

Seeing none, Alderman Hall moves do pass. All in favor say aye. Any opposed say nay.

Seeing that the ayes have it, item is passed. Next up, the middle of the page is document number 22474-T1 in the 44th ward. Ordinances referred 52224.

Common address is 3627-3633 North Sheffield Avenue. Change requests. An RT4, residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to a B32 neighborhood mixed-use district.

Once again, Attorney Nick Patekis.

[Speaker 2] (1:29:08 - 1:30:04)
Thank you, Chairman. For the record, Nick Patekis on behalf of the applicant and property owner, Wrigley Baseball Group, LLC. The applicant is proposing to redevelop the subject property that currently is improved with three residential buildings to one five-story, 29-unit residential building.

The subject property is a transit-serve location and will be supported by 11 parking spaces and 21 bicycle spaces. The applicant is seeking, of course, to reduce the parking ratio, off-street parking ratio, pursuant to TSL from the technical 15 requirement to 11. We are also asking for setback relief specific to siting the building on the lot.

It is a slightly substandard lot, and the intent was to follow the pattern of development on our side of the street. Sheffield, we did work, obviously, with your office as well as the local community organization, and we believe we have your support to proceed at this time.

[Speaker 1] (1:30:05 - 1:30:07)
Great. Thank you. I believe we also have a substitute narrative and plan.

[Speaker 2] (1:30:07 - 1:30:21)
I'm so sorry. Yes, we do have a substitute narrative of plans. Actually, the plans were very similar.

They just added some detail that had been asked or requested as part of our ongoing review process. So, the latest and greatest are part of today's packet.

[Speaker 1] (1:30:21 - 1:30:34)
Great. Thank you. Alderman Mosley moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the Type 1 application.

All in favor, say aye. All opposed, say nay. Seeing the Chair, the ayes have it.

Substitute narrative and plans are accepted. Anything else, Nick?

[Speaker 2] (1:30:35 - 1:30:42)
We do have, if there are questions about design, I do have our project architect. We'd be happy to answer any questions that you or your committee members have.

[Speaker 1] (1:30:42 - 1:30:46)
Great. Any questions by committee members? Alderman Reilly?

[Speaker 30] (1:30:47 - 1:30:59)
Yes, Chairman. Maybe it would be helpful, because we have received some letters of opposition from your constituents and also from historic preservation advocates, if you could describe the community process that you took this through.

[Speaker 1] (1:31:01 - 1:33:03)
Absolutely. Thank you. So, we started this process in the winter.

I believe their first engagement with our local community group was in February. They have been there three times. It was February and, I think, twice in March or maybe once again in April.

This project went on my website in March. Actually, earlier, it was, I think, February. It was mentioned three times in my worldwide e-news in March and April to solicit feedback, along with another project on Belmont.

It has been covered extensively in the media because of the location. Several outlets, probably a dozen in the last, certainly, three months. It went through East Lakeview Neighbors, which is one of my more active community groups, to be honest, better organized than some others, that had several conversations on this.

There were a number of revisions that were made, I'm sure that your owners will tell you, to get a building that felt right materially with sort of the bays that you see in our neighborhood. There are some arches on the current building now that they wanted to replace. And so, there are a lot of changes made there.

There are six current units currently on site. There will be six affordable units in the new building. None of the units currently are subsidized or affordable.

They may be market rate or below. There's also an agreement on this. This is currently two rooftop buildings in a site.

So, all three have been blocked by the right field scoreboard. There's really no commercial activity viable here anymore. So, the owners have agreed to a covenant to not allow any commercial activity, no rooftop seating, nothing like that, just a traditional residential building.

As I stated, these are not orange rated. Actually, very little of this will be visible from your traditional view, either on TV or in the right seat, you might see it, but that's about it. So, that's been our process.

I don't know if I've left anything out, but certainly robust, certainly, you know, putting it in my newsletter, putting it out there, you know, it's across the street from Wrigley, it gets media, right? So, that's been the tale.

[Speaker 30] (1:33:09 - 1:33:35)
Thank you, Chairman, for the explanation. I, you know, had total faith that you'd take this through a full vetting process. And while I understand the historic preservation advocates' admiration for these older buildings, they are handsome buildings, the fact that they aren't orange rated, I think, says a lot.

So, that said, I move to pass. Thank you. One more question, or Alderman Spada?

[Speaker 19] (1:33:36 - 1:33:46)
Thank you, Terry. I did just want to ask, who is the architect on this project? Because this is one of the more handsome non-plan development items we've seen come across the committee.

[Speaker 2] (1:33:47 - 1:34:19)
I agree. It's DXU Architects. Dave is in the crowd.

Probably got a card for you. I'll take it. To the Alderman's point, this is probably the seventh iteration of the plan and the facade.

There was a little bit more of a warehouse starting point. And based on context in the concept, it at least seven times to get to where we're at now. And again, this is a type one.

So, what's being presented, if it were approved, is the only program that could be permitted.

[Speaker 19] (1:34:20 - 1:34:25)
There's a lot of character built into what's in front of us here. And I really appreciate it.

[Speaker 1] (1:34:25 - 1:34:26)
I appreciate it, too.

[Speaker 19] (1:34:26 - 1:34:26)
Thank you, Terry.

[Speaker 1] (1:34:26 - 1:35:05)
Thank you, Alderman Spada. Any other questions by committee members? Seeing none, Alderman Riley moves to pass.

All in favor, say aye. Any opposed, say nay. The Chair, the ayes have it.

It's passed with the substitute narrative and plans. Thank you. Next, the bottom of page six is document number 22466-T1 in the 36th Ward.

Ordinance referred 52224. Common address is 1923 West Race Avenue. Change request is an RT3.5 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district. We have Nick Fotekas. Yes.

[Speaker 2] (1:35:07 - 1:35:54)
So, thank you again, Chairman Nick Fotekas, for the record. I'm here on behalf of James and Mindy Knievel. The applicants own and live at the subject property at 1923 West Race.

They are proposing a rear addition to their single-family home. The property itself, though, is substandard in depth, so the resulting configuration will be an attached garage. We did go through this process once under the prior alderman.

The RT3.5, unfortunately, did not account for all the floor area that the city calculated. So, we are coming back to the committee on a new type one zoning change to RT4 to permit the home addition. Again, it remains a single-family home to be owned or occupied.

I'm happy to answer any questions your committee members have.

[Speaker 1] (1:35:55 - 1:35:59)
Great. Thank you. We have Raymond Valadez from the 36th Ward to speak on this.

[Speaker 33] (1:35:59 - 1:36:21)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. For the record, my name is Raymond Valadez. I'm policy director to Alderman Villegas.

Regarding this matter, the neighbors within 250 feet of the property were informed of the error and the need for the new zoning change. There were no objections. Therefore, Alderman Villegas is supportive of this application and would appreciate the support of the committee members.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:36:21 - 1:36:57)
Great. Thank you, Mr. Valadez. Any questions by committee members?

Seeing none, Alderman Conway moves to pass. All in favor, say aye. Any opposed, say nay.

The ayes have it. The item is passed. Thank you.

Thank you. Top of page seven is document number 22464-T1 in the 32nd Ward. Ordinance is referred 52224.

Common address is 2426 through 2428 North Clybourne Avenue. Change request is an M12 limited manufacturing business park district to an RM5 residential multi-unit district. Once again, Nick Fitikas.

[Speaker 2] (1:36:57 - 1:38:23)
Chairman, for the record, Nick Fitikas. I'm here on behalf of the applicant and property owner Okita Dial. The subject property today is actually non-conforming.

It is a atypically or irregularly shaped lot. In total, there's approximately 5,600 square feet of total lot area and the properties are currently manufacturing zone. The proposed zoning change would allow for the lot to be divided.

The existing property with a retail space in two residential units above at 2426 North Clybourne will remain without change. The newly created zoning lot at 2428 North Clybourne would be developed with a new three-story three-unit residential building. We did work directly with Alderman Wagesbeck on the project.

I'd also point out that because of the irregular lot shape and the fact that the properties are landlocked, part of our application is to reduce the off-street parking because there's no way for us to provide off-street parking at the subject property. So again, we do believe that the Alderman's office had issued a letter of support for this project. I'd be happy to answer any questions your committee members have.

Oh, it's the second time. I apologize. There were substitute plans and a narrative with more complete programming for both the existing and proposed lots.

So if you can please add the substitute plans and narrative, I'd appreciate it.

[Speaker 1] (1:38:24 - 1:38:35)
Alderman Puentes moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type one application. All in favor say aye. Any opposed say nay.

Committee Chair, the ayes have it. The substitute narrative and plans are accepted. Alderman Riley.

[Speaker 30] (1:38:36 - 1:38:40)
Thank you, Chairman. Since Alderman Wagesbeck supports the zoning change, I move to pass.

[Speaker 1] (1:38:41 - 1:39:11)
All right. Seeing no other hands, Alderman Riley moves to pass with the substituted narrative and plans. All in favor say aye.

Any opposed say nay. Committee Chair, the ayes have it. Item is passed.

Next up is document number 22473-T1 in the 32nd Ward. Ordinance referred 52224. Common address is 3036 North Lincoln Avenue.

Change request is B12, Neighborhood Shopping District, to B33, Community Shopping District. Nick Fitikas.

[Speaker 2] (1:39:11 - 1:40:01)
Chairman, Nick Fitikas for the record here on behalf of Envoy Partners LLC, the applicant contract purchaser in this case. The applicants are proposing to purchase the subject property and adapt and reuse the existing four-story building. The resulting property or project would have retail space at grade, seven off-street parking spaces, and a total of 16 residential units above grade.

We did work with Alderman Wagesbeck's office on the adaptive reuse program. All the existing building conditions will remain. Again, this is all an interior reconfiguration or adaptive reuse of the existing structure.

We believe the Alderman has issued a letter of support. I'd be happy to answer any questions you or the board members have about the project. And yes, there is a substitute ordinance.

We caught a typo in the originally filed ordinance, so I'd ask that that be incorporated.

[Speaker 1] (1:40:01 - 1:40:10)
Alderman McDowell makes a motion to accept the substitute ordinance. All in favor say aye. All opposed say nay.

Committee Chair, the ayes have it. Alderman Riley.

[Speaker 30] (1:40:11 - 1:40:23)
Thank you, Chairman. The rendering looks like a really beautiful project, a great adaptive reuse. So congratulations to the developer, Alderman Wagesbeck, who has indicated he supports this zoning change.

Therefore, I move to pass.

[Speaker 1] (1:40:24 - 1:40:34)
Great. Seeing no other hands, Alderman Riley moves to pass. All in favor say aye.

All opposed say nay. And the Chair, the ayes have it with the substitute ordinance passed.

[Speaker 2] (1:40:34 - 1:40:34)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:40:36 - 1:41:28)
All right. Document number 22410-T1 in the 34th board. Ordinance referred 41724, common address is 1073 West Polk Street.

Change request, an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit to an RM4.5 residential multi-unit district. We're going to hear it with the following item, which is the top of page eight, which I'll read into the record. One motion or two?

Two motions, but we'll hear them together. Document number 22409-T1 in the 34th board. Ordinance referred 41724, common address 1065 West Polk Street.

Change request, an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to an RM4.5 residential multi-unit district. Both have Attorney Nicholas Fatikas, who's added your full name here before the end, and substitute narrative and plans. Do you want to speak to them or just take a motion?

[Speaker 2] (1:41:29 - 1:41:30)
We can take a motion.

[Speaker 1] (1:41:31 - 1:41:43)
All right. Alderman Mosley moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type one applications. All in favor, say aye.

Opposed, say nay. And the chairs, I have it. Substitute narrative and plans are before us.

[Speaker 2] (1:41:43 - 1:42:35)
Thank you, Chairman. These are two proposed sister buildings, again, 1065 West Polk and 1073 West Polk. Both properties are 24 feet wide by 100 feet deep and improved with older non-functional residential buildings.

The applicant in both cases is proposing to develop each of the properties with the new three-story, three-unit residential building. The proposed buildings will be supported by two off-street parking spaces. We have worked with Alderman Conway, participated in a community meeting for this project.

And I want to be clear on the record that we have incorporated into the plans a landscape detail for the front of the property, and we also reconfigured the floor plans to address questions that came up with the originally proposed configuration. So the plans that were ultimately presented to the community organization or the community at large are what is before the committee today.

[Speaker 1] (1:42:36 - 1:42:39)
Thank you. Any questions? Alderman Conway, did you want to add?

[Speaker 41] (1:42:43 - 1:43:03)
As Attorney Fetikas indicated, this did go through a rigorous community process and I appreciate the few adjustments that were suggested, that were incorporated. And these properties right now are in a bit of disrepair and very excited to welcome them to the 34th Ward, these buildings. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:43:03 - 1:43:46)
Great. Thank you, Alderman. Any other questions?

Alderman Riley? Alderman Riley, moves do pass on item number 22410-T1 and item number 22409-T1 with the substitute narrative in plans. All in favor say aye.

Opposed say nay. The ayes have it and these two items are passed. All right, middle of eights.

Next last item, document number 22416-T1 in the 32nd Ward, ordinance referred 41724. Common address 1934-36 West North Avenue. Change request, C12, Neighborhood Commercial District to B33, Community Shopping District.

Attorney Nick Fetikas.

[Speaker 2] (1:43:47 - 1:44:51)
Chairman again, Nick Fetikas for the Law Offices of Sam Banks here on behalf of Envoy Partners LLC. The applicant in this case is proposing a similar adaptive reuse program to what we spoke about a few matters ago on Lincoln Avenue. Point of interest, the subject property was a former real world house.

It is being adapted and reused. Retail at grade and then in our negotiations or review process with Alderman Wagespac, we have a total of eight residential units proposed above grade. So with respect to the substitute plans and narrative, they reflect the change from the originally proposed nine units to now eight total units.

The building itself sits lot line to lot line. So unfortunately, we're not able to provide any additional parking offsite. So we are seeking as part of our type one to reduce the offshoot parking requirements to zero.

Otherwise, the height and footprint of the existing structure will remain. Again, we work extensively with Alderman Wagespac. We agreed to reduce the total number of units to eight.

And I believe based on that condition, the Alderman had issued a letter of support.

[Speaker 1] (1:44:52 - 1:45:16)
And it worked closely with the Alderman, you developed a substitute narrative and plans that we need to approve for the committee. Yes, we do. Which is good.

Alderman Mosley moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans. All in favor say aye. Opposed say nay.

Question? Keep going. Questions by committee members?

Alderman Spada? I'll pause. Just keep going.

Okay. Alderman Reilly?

[Speaker 30] (1:45:17 - 1:45:26)
Thank you, Chairman. It's another very attractive adaptive reuse. I congratulate Alderman Wagespac on this project and because he supports it, I move do pass.

[Speaker 1] (1:45:27 - 1:45:59)
Any other questions by committee members? Seeing none, Alderman Reilly moves do pass. All in favor say aye.

Opposed say nay. Making sure the ayes have it. Item is passed.

Thank you, Mr. Patikas. Thank you. All right.

Bottom of page eight is document number 22467 in the 36th ward. Ordinance referred 52224. Common address is 6019 West Fullerton Avenue.

Change request. B32 Community Shopping District to B22 Neighborhood Mixed Youth District. I have attorney Frederick Augustin.

[Speaker 28] (1:46:00 - 1:46:40)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. For the record, Fred Augustin. I'm with the law office of Sam Banks at 221 Northwest South Street.

I'm here on behalf of the applicant, Francisco Cordero. The applicant owns the property at 6019 West Fullerton Avenue. Subject property is currently approved with a one-story commercial building.

We would like to change the current zoning from the current B32 Community Shopping District to a B22 Neighborhood Mixed Youth District. The reason for this change is, Mr. Chairman, we are keeping the existing building. We are converting the existing commercial building into one dwelling unit.

We have worked with Alderman Vega's office on this matter. I believe Raymond is here to speak on that.

[Speaker 1] (1:46:41 - 1:46:44)
Thank you, Fred. We do have Raymond Valadez from Alderman Vega's office.

[Speaker 33] (1:46:45 - 1:46:59)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. With this application, also neighbors were notified. There were no objections pertaining to the conversion from commercial space to residential space.

Therefore, Alderman Vega is supportive of the matter and would appreciate the committee's support. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:47:00 - 1:47:34)
Thank you, Mr. Valadez. Any other questions by committee members? Seeing none, Alderman Ramirez, moves do pass.

All in favor say aye. Opposed say nay. Ensure the ayes have it.

Item is passed. Top of page nine is document number 22470 in the 38th Ward. Ordinance referred 52224.

Common address is 4041 through 43 North Melvina Avenue. Change request, an RS2 residential single unit detached house to RS3 residential single unit district. Once again, Fred Augustin.

[Speaker 28] (1:47:35 - 1:48:14)
Thanks, Chairman. For the record, Fred Augustin. I'm here on behalf of the applicant, MK Construction and Builders Inc.

The applicant is redeveloping the property at 4041 to 43 North Melvina. It's currently improved with a very old dilapidated single family residence. We would like to amend the current zoning from the current RS2 district to an RS3 district.

The plan is to demolish the existing home and build a new single family residence with a two-car garage. We have worked with Alderman Sposato and his office on this matter. We did have a community meeting.

All were in support and I believe he should have a letter on file.

[Speaker 1] (1:48:14 - 1:48:26)
We do have a letter from Alderman Sposato. Any questions by committee members? Seeing none, Alderman Dowell, moves do pass.

All in favor say aye. Any opposed say nay. Ensure the ayes have it.

Item is passed.

[Speaker 38] (1:48:26 - 1:48:27)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:48:28 - 1:48:31)
Thank you.

[Speaker 24] (1:48:59 - 1:50:34)
With the law firm of Taft, Stettinius, and Hollister located at 111 East Wacker in Chicago, Illinois. Taft represents the applicant 2120 Lawrence Avenue. Here with me today is Beata Kozakiewicz, manager of the applicant.

The applicant is also the property owner. The subject property is located at 2120 West Lawrence Avenue, is improved with a one-story building which operates as Oak Tree Academy, a daycare facility. Beata is also the director of the daycare facility.

The applicant is seeking a zoning amendment from the existing RS3 district to a B11 district in order to bring the subject property into conformity with the adjacent properties B1-1 zoning districts. The existing building shall remain. There are no proposed additions or expansions to the existing building.

Also, there is no on-site parking. However, the required two parking spaces for the daycare are being served at 2114 West Lawrence Avenue, which was approved as part of a special use. The applicant discussed its proposed zoning amendment with Alderman Matt Martin, has secured the support of the Heart of Lincoln Square Neighbors Association and the Lincoln Square Ravenswood Chamber of Commerce, and we also have a letter of support from Alderman Martin, and that concludes our testimony, and we're available for any questions.

[Speaker 1] (1:50:34 - 1:50:39)
Great, thank you, Ms. Micas. We do have a letter from Alderman Martin. Questions by committee members?

Alderman Espada.

[Speaker 19] (1:50:39 - 1:51:04)
Thank you so much, Chair. I really appreciate the zoning change. I'm really glad to make a motion to pass because RS-3 feels like an incredibly non-conforming zoning category for the land use we see in front of us.

I had one question, which is, and it's tangential to this, but where are we placing the loading zone for the daycare? Because it looks like you have a crosswalk directly in front of you here.

[Speaker 24] (1:51:05 - 1:51:06)
It's on the side.

[Speaker 19] (1:51:07 - 1:51:08)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:51:08 - 1:51:15)
The loading zone is on the side of the building. So, Alderman McDowell and I have the same question. Do we know how this got to R-3?

[Speaker 24] (1:51:15 - 1:51:15)
No.

[Speaker 1] (1:51:16 - 1:51:17)
No, it's just been there.

[Speaker 24] (1:51:18 - 1:51:19)
As far as we...

[Speaker 1] (1:51:19 - 1:51:21)
Special from 30 years ago?

[Speaker 34] (1:51:22 - 1:51:26)
And what's the adjacent? I mean, are the adjacent buildings...

[Speaker 1] (1:51:26 - 1:51:30)
All of the businesses are right on that block, or right next door.

[Speaker 42] (1:51:31 - 1:51:31)
Pizza.

[Speaker 1] (1:51:35 - 1:51:36)
Go right into the mic. I'm sorry.

[Speaker 42] (1:51:36 - 1:51:48)
So, there's Borelli's Pizza right next to us, and also on the east side, there is a residential building that is not used for commercial. It just seems to be an apartment. Right.

Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:51:50 - 1:52:22)
Any other questions? All right. Seeing none, all the canoots and moves do pass.

All in favor, say aye. Opposed, say nay. Making sure the ayes have it.

Item is passed. Thank you both. Best of luck.

Thank you. Definitely a high-need industry. Top of 10 is document number 22462 in the 45th ward.

Ordinance referred 52224. Common address is 4041 North Milwaukee Avenue. Change request, B13, Neighborhood Shopping District, to B33, Community Shopping District.

We have attorney Mark Sussman.

[Speaker 36] (1:52:23 - 1:52:26)
Let me correct that. I'm not an attorney. I'm the managing member of the LLC.

[Speaker 1] (1:52:27 - 1:52:29)
We have witness Mark Sussman to present.

[Speaker 36] (1:52:30 - 1:53:21)
Thank you. Owner and applicant. This is a simple up zone.

In our shopping district, Six Corners, about 90% of the properties are B3, C, or PDs with those underlying zonings. Scattered about, including us, are some B1-3. As we look forward to the future, one of our current tenants, the National Veterans Art Museum, has publicly announced that they're going to build their own museum in Jeff Park.

I have a big vacancy coming in the future. We wanted to go to B3 to have a longer list of users. There's no construction project here.

We're simply trying to increase the list of qualified or allowed uses.

[Speaker 1] (1:53:22 - 1:53:44)
Great. B3 is pretty common. Of course, the National Veterans Museum is really amazing, if anybody hasn't been there.

Glad they're finding bigger space, but that's tough for you. Any questions by committee members on this item? Seeing none, Alderman Conway moves do pass.

It's a Veterans thing, Bill. All in favor, say aye. Opposed, say nay.

Making sure the ayes have it, and the item is passed.

[Speaker 36] (1:53:44 - 1:53:45)
Thank you all.

[Speaker 1] (1:53:47 - 1:54:23)
Document number 22050 in the 11th Ward. Ordinance referred, 12-14-22. Common address is 2819 South Troop Street.

Change request, RS3, residential single-unit detached house district. Form 4.5, residential multi-unit district. Sure.

Alderman Dowell makes a motion to accept the substitute ordinance, which we will have before us. No. All in favor, say aye.

Opposed, say nay. Making sure the ayes have it, substitute is before us, along with the witness, Mark Kupiec.

[Speaker 25] (1:54:23 - 1:55:44)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, Alderman Dowell. My name is Mark Kupiec. I represent the applicant in this case.

The applicant is Linda Hill, and the subject property is improved with a building, an old three-story building, maybe 135 years old. Looks like an original three-flat. Looks like slab on grade, three stories.

Linda bought this building 15 years ago as a three-flat, used it as a three-flat. More recently, a city inspector came by and asked her for permits. There's no permit record because of the age of the building.

And unique feature is, this block of Bridgeport, the sidewalk was raised, the street was raised. So from the street, it looks like a basement apartment, although if you walk around, it's at grade. In any event, we've got a substitute ordinance and a narrative, like to rezone this via the substitute to an R4.

And we've got the narrative to do this as a type one, because we also need a variation, because it's a short lot, only 115 feet deep. So we're asking for a variation on the required minimum lot area requirement. Linda?

[Speaker 1] (1:55:44 - 1:55:54)
Let's do that right now. Although the spotter moves to amend the application to a type one application. All in favor, say aye.

All opposed, say nay. To ensure the ayes have it, the application is amended to a type one.

[Speaker 25] (1:55:55 - 1:56:16)
Good, thank you very much. So Linda went and met with Alderman Lee, told him the problem. Alderman Lee asked to do a community meeting, and there was a community meeting.

With mailed notice, participation was both in person and by Zoom. No objections at the community meeting. And I believe you have the Alderman's hopefully letter of support.

[Speaker 1] (1:56:17 - 1:57:06)
We do have the support from a letter from Alderman Lee. Any questions by community members? I keep trying to call you community members.

Seeing none, Alderman Dowell moves do pass. All in favor, say aye. All opposed, say nay.

To ensure the ayes have it, it's passed as a type one application with substituted ordinance. Correct. Thank you.

Thank you. All right. Bottom of 10 is document number 22457 in the 40th ward.

Ordinance referred 52224. Common address is 5308 to 5310 North Damon Avenue. Change request is a B12 Neighborhood Shopping District and B13 Neighborhood Shopping District to a B23 Neighborhood Mixed Use District.

We have Robert Matanke.

[Speaker 35] (1:57:06 - 1:58:02)
Good morning, Mr. Vice Chairman and honorable members of the Zoning Committee. I'm Robert W. Matanke of the law firm of Matanke, Matanke.

I represent 5310 North Damon LLC, the owner of the property. For a long time, the two storefronts of this property were vacant and not much to look at. There are other properties on the block that have no first floor commercial, even though they're zoned for business.

And with the support of the Alderman and the community, we've asked for an amendment to the zoning ordinance to increase the zoning from B12 to B23 so that we could replace the two storefronts with two dwelling units for a total of nine dwelling units in the existing building. The shell will stay the same and also to allow the existing six parking spaces on this 50-foot wide lot to remain in support of the needs of the building.

[Speaker 45] (1:58:05 - 1:58:05)
Great.

[Speaker 1] (1:58:06 - 1:58:18)
Any questions by committee members? Seeing none, Alderman Ramirez moves do pass. All in favor, say aye.

Opposed, say nay. Make sure the ayes have it. Item is passed.

Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

[Speaker 35] (1:58:18 - 1:58:18)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (1:58:19 - 1:59:24)
Top of page 11 is document number 22452 in the 39th ward. Ordinance referred 52224. Common address is 5743 North Kingsdale Avenue.

Change request is an RS1 residential single unit district to an RS3 residential single unit district. Do we have a witness on this item? I have Andres Koslowski as the owner and applicant, but I don't have a witness name.

The item on Kingsdale, 5743. We will come back. Let's see if we can get ahold of some of this.

All right. Middle of page 11 is document number 22445-T1 in the 36th ward. Ordinance referred 52224.

Common address is 1334 North Ridgeway Avenue. Change request an RS3 residential single unit district to an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district. Going slow to give you a little time.

Here we have attorney Agnes Plekka.

[Speaker 7] (1:59:34 - 2:00:37)
Chairman, good morning members of the committee. My name is Agnes Plekka. I'm an attorney with law firm of Jeff Yen Berlin.

And I'm representing Yoni and Kate Mora, the owners and the applicants in this proposed rezoning. And very simply, the subject property is included with this beautiful historic Greyston building located on a 3100 square foot parcel. And the applicant is proposing to preserve.

We have retained the building. And during the permitting process, he learned that the existing basement units and old unit did not have any permit records. So we're simply legalizing the existing basement unit.

It's not in ADU area. So hence the zoning proposal. And we have worked very closely with Alderman Villegas and policy director Mr. Ray Valdez. And we had a very good community meeting. Everybody was in support of it. So we were advised that Alderman Villegas also supports this project.

And we hope that the policy director will confirm this today.

[Speaker 1] (2:00:38 - 2:00:40)
Great. Thank you, Ms. Baca. Mr. Valadez.

[Speaker 33] (2:00:41 - 2:00:58)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I can't affirm that a community meeting was held and those present were universally in support of the zoning change to allow for the legal conversion of the basement unit. Therefore Alderman Villegas is supportive of this application and would appreciate the committee support.

Thank you.

[Speaker 7] (2:00:59 - 2:01:27)
Mr. Chairman, I apologize. I should also mention that we do have this optional relief that we're asking for. And this is for the rear setback for the proposed carport.

So the variation that we would be asking for is from 37.2 required to zero proposed. And again, the hardship here is that the ordinance is a little bit, there's some ambiguity in the ordinance. So the enclosed garage is permitted in the rear setback but an open carport it's not.

So hence the use for the variation. Thank you, sir.

[Speaker 1] (2:01:28 - 2:02:02)
Great. Any questions by committee members? Seeing none, Vice Mayor Burnett moves do pass.

All in favor say aye. Opposed say nay. Make sure the ayes have it.

And item is passed. Bottom of page 11 is document number 22446-T1 in the 36th ward. Common address, I'm sorry, ordinance referred 52224.

Common address is 2616 West Haddon Avenue. Change request is RS3 residential single unit DTAP single unit district to an RT4 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district. Once again, Agnes Plekka.

[Speaker 7] (2:02:02 - 2:03:06)
Thank you, sir. Again, for the record, my name is Agnes Plekka. I'm an attorney with law firm Jaffe and Berlin.

And I'm here to represent the applicant of the property redevelopment LLC. And actually I have with me Ms. Ada Iris Diaz on behalf of the applicant. And very simply, subject property is improved with a small non-conforming building built 100 years ago with side and front setbacks very small non-conforming again.

Currently, this is one of the smallest buildings on this block. It has multiple structural issues. The property owner looked into rehabbing and possibly making an addition but the foundation is just two weeks.

So at this point, it wouldn't be viable to actually rehab it. So the applicants are proposing to redevelop the property with a new three unit residential building. The project was presented at the community meeting on April 22nd was well attended.

The community expressed their support. We've worked with Alderman Villegas and the policy director and we're hoping that they will continue to support this project as well.

[Speaker 1] (2:03:07 - 2:03:08)
Thank you. Mr. Valdes.

[Speaker 33] (2:03:10 - 2:03:27)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. For this application, there was a virtual community meeting that was held and those participated were supportive of the project for a new three flat at this location. Therefore Alderman Villegas is also supportive and would appreciate the committee support regarding this matter.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:03:27 - 2:03:38)
Thank you. Any questions by committee members? Seeing none.

Alderman Mosley moves do pass. All in favor say aye. Opposed say nay.

Chair the ayes have it. Item is passed. Thank you.

[Speaker 7] (2:03:38 - 2:03:46)
And I just wanted to say extra thank you to Mr. Valdes because he was absolutely wonderful in guiding us and helping us with the community outreach. So thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:03:46 - 2:04:15)
He's a pretty good guy. Are you done yet? Or you have more?

Okay, go ahead. You're not done yet. Document number 22447-T1 of the 21st ward.

Ordinance is referred 52224. Common address is 11416 South Troop Street. Change request.

An RS2 residential single unit detached house district to an RT3.5 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district. We have attorney Agnes Plekka.

[Speaker 7] (2:04:15 - 2:05:10)
Thank you, sir. My name is for the record Agnes Plekka. I'm an attorney with Wealth Home Jaffe in Berlin.

And I'm here to represent the applicant and the owner of the property Ben Williams Homes. And this property, again, improved with all the residential building. And the applicant is proposing to preserve this building.

The building already underwent an extensive rehab. This was a vacant property, abandoned building. The applicant actually completely got rehab the building.

It looks brand new, beautiful. And it provides two naturally occurring affordable housing. Of course, we discovered that the existing basement unit has no permit record.

So this is, again, just to legalize the existing dwelling unit. And we have worked very closely with Wonderful Alderman Mosley. And we had a community outreach and everybody was in support for it.

So we're hoping that Alderman Mosley will confirm that he's still supporting it.

[Speaker 1] (2:05:10 - 2:05:14)
Well, I will call on the wonderful Alderman Mosley to add.

[Speaker 18] (2:05:14 - 2:05:46)
Thank you, chair. Excited to have this rezoning. Again, just bringing forth the building into the correct zoning code for that garden or basement apartment.

Again, preserving or extending more affordable housing options in the ward. We are predominantly a single family home. So this property still gives the aesthetic of a single family home, yet gives more opportunities for multiple families to live there.

So thank you to developers for working on this. Thanks.

[Speaker 1] (2:05:48 - 2:05:59)
Thank you. Any questions by committee members? Seeing none, Alderman Svato moves do pass.

All in favor say aye. Any opposed say nay. Make sure the ayes have it.

And we'll report it out. Item is passed.

[Speaker 7] (2:05:59 - 2:06:15)
And Mr. Chairman, again, my fault. I should have mentioned that we also have an optional support, optional relief on this one for the front side. But we are merely replacing the front porch.

It was too close to the front property line. So hence the variation for the front porch. Thank you, sir.

[Speaker 1] (2:06:16 - 2:06:16)
Item is passed.

[Speaker 7] (2:06:17 - 2:06:18)
Thank you, members of the committee. Thank you, Ms. Blackhat.

[Speaker 1] (2:06:19 - 2:07:09)
Middle of 12 is document number 22453 in the 29th Ward, ordinance referred 52224. Common address is 30 North Menard Avenue. Change request, an RS3, residential single unit district to an RT4, residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district.

Erin and Jacqueline Vanderbilt in the house. Doesn't look like it. We're going to pass that and come back to it.

Bottom of the page is document number 22414 in the 3rd Ward, ordinance referred 41723. Common address is 2328 South Michigan Avenue. Change request, DS5, downtown service district to DX5, mixed use district and then to residential business plan development.

We have attorney Mariah Degrino.

[Speaker 4] (2:07:10 - 2:07:11)
Not Katie, yes.

[Speaker 1] (2:07:11 - 2:07:13)
Thank you.

[Speaker 4] (2:07:13 - 2:07:21)
Covering for Katie today. My name is Mariah Degrino with the law firm of DLA Piper representing the applicant in this matter, 2328 South Michigan Owner LLC.

[Speaker 1] (2:07:22 - 2:07:30)
Just one second. We're good? I mean, Sergeant-at-Arms.

Please continue.

[Speaker 4] (2:07:31 - 2:07:50)
Nicole, did Katie or Rich send any presentation materials? As a preliminary matter, this application was considered and recommended for approval at the June 20th, 2024 plan commission hearing. And we would request that the transcript from that hearing be incorporated into the record.

[Speaker 1] (2:07:52 - 2:08:03)
Yes, Alder Fuentes makes a motion to incorporate all records and findings for the plan commission hearing. All in favor, say aye. Opposed, say nay.

The opinion of the chair, the ayes have it. The records are incorporated.

[Speaker 4] (2:08:03 - 2:08:48)
Thank you. The site is located mid-block on the West side of Michigan Avenue between 23rd and 24th Street. It is currently vacant, but was previously a Burger King drive with a drive-through.

The proposed development consists of an 18 story building containing up to 256 dwelling units and 10 auto parking spaces. In addition to the neighborhood opportunity bonus, the project is taking advantage of the floor area bonus allowed under the new connected communities ordinance that allows projects to swap affordable housing for parking. As a result, 25% of the units on site will be affordable.

The project team worked closely with Alderman Dowell and the Near South Planning Board. We are available for any questions and I see that Alderman Dowell is here to speak on the matter as well.

[Speaker 1] (2:08:49 - 2:08:51)
Great, thank you. Alderman Dowell.

[Speaker 34] (2:08:52 - 2:09:26)
Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman. This project has passed the plan commission and although you don't see the 18 story residential behind this building that will probably front Wabash it is there and want to thank the developer Fernhill for taking advantage of the city incentives in order to bring affordable housing to this site. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:09:27 - 2:09:30)
Thank you, Alderman Spada.

[Speaker 19] (2:09:31 - 2:10:25)
I just wanted to like, if I may boost the chairwoman's comments. It's so true. It's worth going back to the plan commission website looking at the presentation.

It's not an optical illusion. It's not a misplaced rendering. Literally the tower part of this is set back so much that you don't actually even see it in the street.

You create this real cohesive frontage along the landmark district and it's one of the most really remarkable things that I think have come before the plan commission. I think the way you incorporate green space within the courtyard of the building is really outstanding. It has some really fantastic live work spaces in the development.

It's a really, really cool project. Thank you for bringing it forward. And thank you chair for giving us really over the last year or so, some really inspiring cases in the zoning committee.

Thank you, chair.

[Speaker 1] (2:10:26 - 2:11:05)
Any other questions? That glowing review, although the Spada moves do pass with the records incorporated all in favor say aye. Opposed say nay.

In the name of the chair, the item is passed. Thank you. Thank you.

And we're on to the bottom of page 13, document number 22360 in the 27th ward. Ordinance referred to 1524. Common address is 345 North Aberdeen.

Change request is an M23 light industry district to DX7 downtown mixed use district and then to residential business plan development. Once again, Maria Degrino.

[Speaker 4] (2:11:05 - 2:11:23)
Thank you. The applicant is 345 North Aberdeen LLC. As a preliminary matter, this application was considered and recommended for approval at the June 20th, 2024 plan commission hearing.

And again, I'd like to request that the transcript from that hearing be incorporated into the record of today's proceedings.

[Speaker 1] (2:11:23 - 2:11:33)
Alderman Mosley makes a motion to incorporate all records and findings from the plan commission hearing. All in favor say aye. Opposed say nay.

The chair, the ayes have it. The records are incorporated.

[Speaker 4] (2:11:34 - 2:11:59)
Thank you. The site is located mid-block on the North side of Carroll between Carpenter and Aberdeen and was previously the site of the now relocated Kugel Foods. The proposed development consists of a 44-story building containing up to 559 dwelling units and 255 auto parking spaces.

The project team worked closely with Alderman Burnett and the impacted Fulton Market community groups. I'm available for any questions and I thank you for your consideration.

[Speaker 29] (2:12:00 - 2:12:13)
Thank you. Vice Mayor Burnett. Yeah, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I don't know if the council have all the other information as far as how much our Neighborhood Opportunity Fund bonus money is going to go into this.

[Speaker 4] (2:12:14 - 2:12:16)
I have in my notes, it's about $5 million.

[Speaker 29] (2:12:16 - 2:12:23)
$5 million neighborhood NOL to be going to other wards throughout the city of Chicago.

[Speaker 4] (2:12:25 - 2:12:33)
I know part of that includes the Local Impact Fund and there's an Adopt-a-Landmark Fund. If you give me just a moment, I can probably pull that figure up for you.

[Speaker 29] (2:12:33 - 2:12:34)
So you say about $5 million?

[Speaker 4] (2:12:35 - 2:12:37)
And the total amount of the payment is about $5 million.

[Speaker 29] (2:12:38 - 2:12:41)
So it would probably be about $460.

[Speaker 4] (2:12:49 - 2:12:56)
Yeah, the Neighborhood Opportunity Bonus Fund payment is about $5 million. I believe about 10% of that is, yeah, so it's about four.

[Speaker 29] (2:12:57 - 2:12:59)
10% stay in the community, 10% go to Landmark.

[Speaker 4] (2:12:59 - 2:12:59)
Yeah.

[Speaker 29] (2:13:00 - 2:13:07)
So, which is good. So this is a win for the city. How many affordable units?

[Speaker 4] (2:13:13 - 2:13:15)
20% on site. So that would be 112.

[Speaker 29] (2:13:16 - 2:13:25)
And then, okay. I just wanted to put that out there. And how many construction jobs?

[Speaker 4] (2:13:28 - 2:13:34)
Estimated construction jobs, about 2,800 are estimated.

[Speaker 29] (2:13:35 - 2:13:37)
2,800 construction jobs?

[Speaker 4] (2:13:38 - 2:13:42)
That's according to the presentation. Okay, all right.

[Speaker 29] (2:13:42 - 2:13:56)
It's a great project, right? Yeah, it's a great project for the city. We did have a community meeting.

The majority of people in the community meeting supported it. All of the community organizations supported it. We ask that this body supports it.

[Speaker 1] (2:13:58 - 2:14:35)
Thank you, Vice Mayor. Any questions? Seeing none, all remandal moves do pass.

All in favor, say aye. All opposed, say nay. Moving to the chair, the ayes have it.

The records are passed as revised. All right, it's top of 14. Faculty number 21128 in the second ward.

Ordinance referred, 92122. Common address is 2031-33 North Kingsbury Street. Change request is M22 Light Industry District to B35 Community Shopping District.

And then to Residential Business Plan Development. We have Maria Degrino.

[Speaker 4] (2:14:35 - 2:14:50)
Thank you. Again, the applicant here is Alloy Property Company 2 LLC. As a preliminary matter, this application was considered and recommended for approval at the May 16th, 2024 plan commission hearing.

And I would ask that the record of that, the transcript be incorporated into today's record.

[Speaker 1] (2:14:51 - 2:15:01)
Alder Mosley makes a motion to incorporate all records and findings from the plan commission hearing today. All in favor, say aye. All opposed, say nay.

To the chair, the ayes have it. The records are incorporated.

[Speaker 4] (2:15:02 - 2:15:51)
Thank you. The site is located on the east side of Kingsbury, mid-block between Magnolia and Southport. The proposed development consists of a 24-story building containing up to 355 dwelling units, 360 bike parking spaces, and 203 auto parking spaces.

Approximately one third of the site will be devoted to open space with green space, plaza area, and integrated seating. Assuming approval by the city council of a pending low affordability community ordinance, 71 units or 20% will be provided on site, which is notable given the Lincoln Park community area has only approximately 13% affordable housing. The project team worked closely with Alderman Hopkins and the Sheffield Neighborhood Association on this project, as well as presenting to the committee on design.

I ask for your favorable recommendation and thank you for your consideration.

[Speaker 1] (2:15:54 - 2:15:59)
Thank you. Any questions? Vice Mayor Bernat?

[Speaker 29] (2:15:59 - 2:16:12)
Yeah, and I'm trying not to ask too many more questions. So I know this is going to be neighborhood opportunity funds too, but is it because this is in the manufacturing area, is this industrial funds also?

[Speaker 4] (2:16:13 - 2:16:17)
I don't have that in my notes, but again, I apologize for not having that data point.

[Speaker 29] (2:16:18 - 2:16:21)
Would Patrick know? Patrick, just don't call it that.

[Speaker 4] (2:16:22 - 2:16:25)
Do you know if there's an industrial conversion fee for this one, for Kingsbury?

[Speaker 38] (2:16:25 - 2:16:29)
I will confirm. I think this is outside of it, but I will confirm.

[Speaker 4] (2:16:34 - 2:16:35)
Let me see if I can.

[Speaker 29] (2:16:36 - 2:16:38)
So how much is the neighborhood opportunity fund?

[Speaker 38] (2:16:42 - 2:16:58)
So the neighborhood opportunity fund for this far would not apply in the same way. There's a different bonus system for the North Branch area, and there are certain portions of the North Branch that are outside of the conversion as they were not formerly PMD, but I'll confirm what the previous district was for this.

[Speaker 1] (2:17:00 - 2:17:10)
All right, let's do this. Brian Pellerin is here from the Second Ward. Go ahead and say a few words and we'll pull those numbers.

[Speaker 32] (2:17:11 - 2:17:53)
Thank you. Good afternoon, Brian Pellerin, Staff Assistant to Alderman Hopkins to speak on his behalf. We hosted multiple community meetings on this matter, one last summer, as well as one two weeks ago.

This massing is a major improvement over a previous one that was more of a wall. This massing also allows for much greater public open green space. The developer will be making significant improvements to the public way in the immediate vicinity of this building, including a private driveway with an easement, making it possible to minimize future curb cuts on the block.

And Sheffield Neighbors Association, which is the Neighborhood Association of record, supports this proposal. Alderman Hopkins requests this committee's favorable consideration. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:17:54 - 2:17:55)
Thank you, Mr. Pellerin.

[Speaker 4] (2:17:56 - 2:18:07)
Yes, to clarify the question about the Neighborhood Opportunity Bonus Fund, this is the overall FAR will be five. So it appears they are not taking a bonus. So there would not be a corresponding payment.

Is that?

[Speaker 45] (2:18:09 - 2:18:09)
Deputy Commissioner.

[Speaker 38] (2:18:11 - 2:18:30)
So if it's within the designated area for the bonus, the maximum they can do by right is three and a half, or I'm sorry, three. So anything above three would be a bonus, even if it doesn't go to six and a half. But if it's outside of the conversion area where the bonus is available, then yes, you're correct.

But I'm still checking. Unless you know for certain. Did you already look that it's outside?

[Speaker 4] (2:18:30 - 2:18:31)
I did not.

[Speaker 1] (2:18:31 - 2:19:14)
Do we want to wait on this one? Okay. All right.

Vice Mayor Burnett moves do pass. All in favor say aye. Opposed say nay.

To ensure the ayes have it, the item is passed as revised. Thank you. Middle of 14 is document number 22399 in the 21st ward.

Ordinance referred 41724. Common address is 1001 through 1235 West 119th Street and 1000 through 1234 West 120th Street. Change request is PMD 10, planned manufacturing district to industrial planned development.

We have attorney Mariah Degrino.

[Speaker 4] (2:19:15 - 2:19:32)
Thank you. The applicant is West Pullman Development Partners, LLC. I'm also joined by Rob Rose with the developer in the gallery today as well.

This application was considered and recommended for approval at the June 20th, 2024 plan commission hearing. And I would ask that the record, the transcript be incorporated into today's record.

[Speaker 1] (2:19:33 - 2:19:42)
Although the spot, it makes motion to incorporate all records and findings from that hearing. All in favor say aye. Opposed say nay.

In the chair, the ayes have it. The records are incorporated.

[Speaker 4] (2:19:42 - 2:20:34)
Thank you. The site is located at the Southwest corner of Morgan and 119th Street. The site was historically used for manufacturing and industrial purposes, but was abandoned and is currently vacant.

If you go back one slide, the site is shown in the red outline. PMD 10 is the yellow outline. The city owns the Western portion of the property and the applicant has acquired the remaining portions of the property through tax purchases.

The applicant proposes to redevelop the site with an approximately 413,400 square foot light industrial facility. The property is currently zoned PMD number 10. The applicant seeks to establish an industrial plan development for the project.

The project team is working closely with DPD, Alderman Mosley, and the community to bring this project to life. We ask for your favorable recommendation and thank you for your consideration today.

[Speaker 18] (2:20:35 - 2:21:59)
Thank you. Alderman Mosley. Thank you, Mr. Chair. And thank you to the developers for helping to revitalize the city's 10th plan manufacturing district. This site has had some history and it's not been the best. This is the old International Harborside and Inglesall Rand site that resulted in a brownfield during this demolition and so forth and greatly impacted the residents just south of them in the Victory Heights community or neighborhood area.

And so to have this project or this area come back with remediation that as this move forward we'll know exactly what we need to do there. But to continue on the tradition of residents being able to walk to head of household jobs is something that we're really proud of and hoping that this project is just a pioneer to help bring back the city's 10th plan manufacturing district. It is a beautiful building, quite different than generally the TDL centers that I've seen.

This kind of aluminum stainless steel look really just elevates that 119th drive. And this is right across the street from the Kroc Center. So again, just a well-deserved amenity to the 21st Ward and would ask for the committee's favorable consideration.

[Speaker 1] (2:22:01 - 2:22:06)
Questions by committee members on this? I actually have one. Who did the remediation?

[Speaker 18] (2:22:09 - 2:22:27)
It's a combination. So it first started with multiple levels of government. This moving through plan commission and today will allow the company to do a phase two that will tell us exactly how we need to do the further remediation that is needed.

Great, great. We're glad it's going to be done.

[Speaker 1] (2:22:27 - 2:22:41)
Right. Absolutely. Seeing no other questions by committee members.

Alderman Dowell moves to pass. All in favor say aye. All opposed say nay.

How do you chair? The ayes have it. An item is passed as revised.

Or as revised.

[Speaker 4] (2:22:41 - 2:22:42)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:22:43 - 2:23:07)
Thank you, Mariah. All right. Bottom of 14 is item number 22461-T1 in the 22nd Ward.

Ordinance referred 52224. Common address is 2759 South Lawndale Avenue. Change request is an RS3 residential single unit district to a B12 neighborhood shopping district.

We have the witness Robert Castaneda.

[Speaker 20] (2:23:11 - 2:24:18)
Allow me to be the first person to say good afternoon. Good afternoon. Chairman and members of the committee.

I'm Robert Castaneda, Executive Director of Beyond the Ball, which is the owner and developer of the property located at 2759 South Lawndale Avenue in the 22nd Ward. I'm joined in the gallery by our architects, AP Monarch, who are serving as architects for the project. Beyond the Ball is proposing a change in zoning from RS3 residential single unit detached house to B12 neighborhood shopping district.

The proposed use of the property after rezoning is the construction of a 3,239 square foot space and a 203 square foot attached greenhouse to serve as the primary office for Beyond the Ball. The proposed office development will provide space for our growing staff and team and provide adequate access to our staff by community members and community partners. A small two-story office will be smaller than neighboring residential and business properties and is aligned in scale.

The project was presented to the 22nd Ward Zoning Advisory Committee and Alderman and was approved for support. The new office will promote sustainability in design and construction and support green space development in the community through its greenhouse.

[Speaker 1] (2:24:22 - 2:24:25)
Actually, I'll ask a question. Beyond the Ball, tell us about the name.

[Speaker 20] (2:24:25 - 2:25:19)
So we're a sport and play-based youth community development organization. We use sport and play to build community. We're known for our use of using sport and play to reclaim public spaces from history of violence.

As a matter of fact, this location where we're building our office, where we'd like to build our office with the help of this committee, it was actually all four buildings on the corner because it's an intersection of 20th and Lawndale had been abandoned because the amount of gang violence in that space. And so this location, 2059, the house had been abandoned for well over a decade. It was crooked, we tore it down and we're excited about having our first office space.

In the neighborhood, we started back in 1998. We've always relied on like use borrowing space, whether it's private or public spaces. And so we're optimistic to have our own office space.

[Speaker 1] (2:25:20 - 2:25:25)
Excellent. Congrats on that. Any questions by committee members?

Hi, Robert.

[Speaker 43] (2:25:25 - 2:25:37)
I actually got to meet you years ago through light in the night events. I'm so happy for you. Congratulations.

And I love that it's this location so close to Gary's school. So congrats.

[Speaker 20] (2:25:38 - 2:25:38)

Top of 15 is document number 22459-T1 in the 17th ward. Ordinance referred 52224. The common address is 1434 West 76th Street.

Change request is M12, limited manufacturing business park district to M22, light industry district. We have representatives from Logic Legal and Alan Green.

[Speaker 31] (2:26:15 - 2:27:30)
Good morning, Chairman. Sabrina Harrell for the record. H-E-R-R-E-L-L of Logic Legal on behalf of the Alan Green Group, the applicant.

And to my left is Margaret Ahmed-DeBell who is a manager of Alan Green Group. We're here for the property at 1434 West 76th Street. It is zoned M1-2 and we are seeking a zoning amendment to M2-2 for fleet storage.

The property currently has four existing structures. Those four structures will be renovated. There will be no further additions or no height changes.

The sole purpose of the amendment is to allow the fleet storage for the company that is a paratransit company. We're looking at the architect has estimated that 70 outdoor storage spaces should be permitted. We did have a community meeting.

Thanks to Alderman Moore who was so kind enough to schedule it. We met with the community who were in support and we also received Alderman Moore's support as well.

[Speaker 1] (2:27:31 - 2:27:33)
I believe Alderman Moore is still on.

[Speaker 39] (2:27:34 - 2:28:12)
Yes, I am Chairman. Thank you so much. I'm definitely in support of this project.

First of all, I want to thank this company because this place has been vacant for so long and I was trying to attract people over there. I have a former state senator who lives over there. So we're also looking for the right type of property to put over there.

And this hopefully will also activate some interest in the vacant property just to the east of it so we can get some development over there. So I truly appreciate this and I'm asking for the full support of the committee.

[Speaker 1] (2:28:13 - 2:28:45)
Great. Thank you so much, Alderman. Any questions by committee members?

Seeing none, Alderman Spodumos do pass. All in favor say aye. Opposed say nay.

Chair, the ayes have it. My item is passed. Thank you.

Congrats. Middle of 15 is document number 22283 in the 37th ward. Ordinance referred 11123.

Common address is 335 to 375 North Pulaski Avenue. Change request. Plan manufacturing district number nine to institutional plan development.

We have attorney Bridget O'Keefe.

[Speaker 21] (2:28:45 - 2:29:13)
Good afternoon, Mr. Vice Chairman and members of the committee. I'm Bridget O'Keefe here on behalf of the Chicago Transit Authority, which is seeking approval of an institutional plan development for its new training and control center to be located at 335 to 375 North Pulaski in the 37th ward. This was considered by the plan commission on June 20th, 2024.

And they recommended approval of the project. We ask that the plan commission record be made part of the proceedings today.

[Speaker 1] (2:29:14 - 2:29:23)
Thank you. Vice Mayor Burnett makes a motion to incorporate all records and findings from that hearing. All in favor say aye.

Opposed say nay. And the chair, the ayes have it. The records are incorporated.

[Speaker 21] (2:29:23 - 2:29:27)
And we also have a substitute ordinance today that we asked for approval.

[Speaker 1] (2:29:28 - 2:29:33)
I didn't know about that one. Okay, we're good with that last motion. Yeah.

[Speaker 21] (2:29:34 - 2:30:40)
Great, thank you. I am accompanied by representatives of CTA and the architecture team who are in the galley today. If there's any questions, the slides before you present the proposed training and control center.

The control center will oversee all bus and transit operations and security for the entire CTA system. This is operated 24, seven, 365 days per year. This also will serve as the consolidated training facility for the CTA with high base space for forklift and rail training, offices for traditional training and outdoor multi-purpose training area for bus operations.

Given the applicant, this is a TOD with excellent access to transit. The Lake and Pulaski stations a block away and the 53 bus route operates in front of the building. We have worked closely with Alderman Mitts to garner her and her community support.

A community meeting was held first in March of 2023 to introduce the project. And then we returned in March of 24 to present the final project for her consideration. So we would greatly appreciate the committee's support for the project and are available for any questions you all may have.

[Speaker 1] (2:30:40 - 2:30:43)
Thank you, Ms. O'Keefe. I believe Alderman Mitts, are you still with us on the Zoom?

[Speaker 26] (2:30:46 - 2:30:47)
Yes, I am chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:30:48 - 2:30:50)
Great, thank you. Did you want to add onto this?

[Speaker 26] (2:30:51 - 2:32:15)
Absolutely. I want to thank CTA and thank the partners, our department of planning, the administration, everyone who have helped to bring this project to the community. If you notice in the community currently now where this site is located, it's going to look a lot different, I can tell you, when the work is being done.

It's going to really highlight that particular area on Pulaski and Lake. It's going to take out a lot of things that are not welcoming and you can see the beauty that's going to be coming to the neighborhood. So the community support the project.

I support the project as well and I'm looking favorable on this committee to support it because we also want to create job opportunities. There are beautification for the neighborhood. Working along with my colleague to my east, Alderman Burnett, Alderman Irving, surrounding wards, we're looking to make this a highlight for the Lake Street.

[Speaker 1] (2:32:18 - 2:32:29)
Great, thank you Alderwoman. Any questions by committee members? I'll actually have one.

What is the job total here? Anticipated at completion and construction?

[Speaker 21] (2:32:29 - 2:32:42)
There'll be 224 jobs estimated during construction and there will be a relocation of 120 to 150 jobs upon completion. There are existing facilities in the west loop and it's going to be relocated to here.

[Speaker 1] (2:32:43 - 2:33:06)
I think we've all been there. This is definitely an exciting project. I know we have a lot of things happening in the 37th ward around training facilities.

Well done Alderwoman Metz. Any other questions? Other person Fuentes moves do pass.

All in favor say aye. All opposed say nay. Making sure the ayes have it.

The item is passed as revised.

We're going to honor her. We're going to make her come back, actually. I think that's what we're going to do.

And I'll bring Cinnamon Rolls again to send her off appropriately for all the amazing work she's done for us for all these years. So hopefully in July, if not, very soon after. The way things are going with the Planning Commission, we're going to have to...
