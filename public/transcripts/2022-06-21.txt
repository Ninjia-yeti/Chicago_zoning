[Speaker 1] (0:00 - 0:55)
All right, good morning colleagues. The June 21st, 2022 Committee on Zoning Landmarks and Building Standards is called to order. Pursuant to applicable law, the chairman has determined that an in-person meeting is not practical or prudent.

Accordingly, attendance at this meeting will be by remote means only. We will start off with the roll call. Committee members, please unmute yourself and please note that your yes or present response will be deemed a yes vote when the quorum call is used as a reference vote for later items.

Vice Chair Raboyas, on the roll call. Present. Alderman Hopkins.

Present. Alderman Dowell. Here.

Alderman Sawyer. Alderman Beall. Yep, Mr. Chairman. Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 5] (0:57 - 1:00)
The original is present, Chairman, with my daughter.

[Speaker 1] (1:01 - 1:04)
All right, Alderman Moore.

[Speaker 5] (1:05 - 1:06)
Alderman David Moore is present, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:07 - 2:01)
Good morning. Alderman Mike Rodriguez. Present, Chairman.

Alderman Siccio Lopez. Alderman Burnett. Here.

Alderman Cardona. Present, Chairman. Alderman Wagstaff.

Present. Alderman Austin. Alderman Villegas.

Present. Alderman Riley. Alderman Kappelman.

Present. Alderman Osterman. Present.

Alderwoman Haddon. Alderwoman Haddon, are you there? All right, we do have a quorum, right?

We have 14 members present, and we do have a quorum.

[Speaker 3] (2:02 - 2:03)
Oh, present, Chair. Alderwoman Haddon, sorry.

[Speaker 1] (2:04 - 3:57)
All right, thank you. All right, 15 members, which constitutes a quorum. We will now move on to the approval of the Rule 45 reports, containing the minutes of the May hearing of the Committee on Zoning Landmarks and Building Standards.

All members of this committee should have received a copy of this report electronically, and of hearing no objections. Do I have a motion by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum to approve the minutes? So moved, Alderman Lopez.

Alderman Lopez makes the motion. Any objections to the motion? Hearing none, the report has been approved.

All right, moving on, we will now hear the only item to be deferred. I will read the number, the file number, the address, and page number, and take a motion at the end. Committee members, this item does not appear on the revised agenda in front of you, but on page two of the regular agenda, file number A8750, for the address commonly known as 4401-4431 South Knox Avenue.

Any questions by committee members? Alderman Roboyas makes the motion to defer the previously listed item of the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing no objections, this item has been deferred. And we only have one public comment speaker signed up for today's hearing, and that person is Christopher Anderson. Mr. Anderson, the floor is yours. Christopher Anderson. Christopher? We can hear you.

Identify yourself for the record and proceed.

[Speaker 20] (3:58 - 6:45)
Yes, sir. To Chairman Cuddy, ladies and gentlemen of the committee, and all the persons present, the chief sponsor of the ordinance, which I would like to talk about today, I come to you today with profound respect for the work to be done by this body and the reason for the introduction of the ordinance. Loss of life is a serious matter, and this body and the city council at large should act.

But let's be careful about unintended consequences. As introduced, my name is Christopher J. Anderson of the Chicago Association of Realtors.

On behalf of our 17,500 members, I would like to ask the Zoning Committee to be a true deliberative body as you begin to discuss the Heating and Air Conditioning Substitute Ordinance. While I understand this ordinance does not affect all structures and all high rises, I am concerned about the slippery slope and, moreover, the timing element. For those buildings it does affect, I think it's important to make sure facilities experts, building operators, and maintenance personnel are involved in this process.

I hope during today's discussion, if those professionals were consulted, the public, as well as this committee, will be privy to their input. I am not an engineer, but I know structural changes to a building can be costly. The ordinance before the committee states portable and temporary systems are allowable up until the year 2024.

Coming out of the pandemic and possibly heading towards a recession, I caution against a deadline 24 months away. Supply chain shortages are still a reality. Labor markets are still out of whack with the Great Resignation, and the city's own permitting process is not one that most laypeople can easily navigate.

With that being said, I respectfully ask the provision of 24 months to have serious discussion, not only for the benefit of building management, but ultimately the consumer, the renter, the one who will ultimately pay for these upgrades through higher rents and assessment. To that end, the language in this ordinance seeking implementation 10 days after passage needs to also have serious discussion. Is the city prepared to do the outreach to all facilities across all city wards and assist with paperwork to begin the process?

If not, I again ask for pause. A 30 to 60-day implementation would be best. It allows the city to partner with groups like the realtors and other housing groups to inform our memberships and be the conduit that brings all parties to the table.

It's times like this where true public-private partnership can benefit the city's residents greatly. Again, if it were not for tragedy, we would not be here today, and I encourage you all to act, but I caution you not to act hastily. The realtors are here to be of assistance.

We look forward to the partnership, and with that, I thank you all for your time.

[Speaker 1] (6:49 - 7:42)
Thank you, Mr. Anderson. That concludes the public speaking portion of the hearing. We'll now start off today with the addendum to the agenda.

First item in the addendum is document number 02022-1746, amendment of municipal code section 17-6-0403-F to permit non-accessory parking and RVS or boat storage within planned manufacturing district number 15. We have Steve Valenciano, the assistant zoning administrator here to speak on this matter. Steve, or who is on there?

Steve or Andrew?

[Speaker 27] (7:49 - 8:16)
...facility, and they want to add, be able to add outdoor storage of vehicles, and that's what this text amendment does. So, the department's in support of it, and the alderman, the majority of PMD 15 is in the 29th ward, with a small part in the 37th ward.

[Speaker 1] (8:17 - 8:24)
Steve, my understanding is we have the support of alderman Talantaro, is that correct?

[Speaker 30] (8:25 - 8:26)
Yes, yes.

[Speaker 1] (8:26 - 8:38)
Okay, all right. Any questions by committee members? Alderman Osterman, would you like to be recognized for quorum?

[Speaker 23] (8:40 - 8:43)
I was on the roll call. I got a question for...

[Speaker 1] (8:43 - 8:45)
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Harry. Okay.

[Speaker 23] (8:46 - 8:47)
I got a question for Mr. Valenciano.

[Speaker 1] (8:47 - 9:04)
All right, Alderman Osterman. Chairman, would you recognize me for the meeting? We have recognized you, Alderwoman Austin.

Thank you. Can you recognize me as well, Chairman Alderman Riley? Thank you, Brendan.

You're recognized, and we're now still back to Alderman Osterman.

[Speaker 23] (9:05 - 9:10)
So, Steve, I got a very technical question, if you may. When is your last day with the city?

[Speaker 27] (9:10 - 9:13)
The last day is next Thursday, June 30th.

[Speaker 23] (9:13 - 9:24)
Okay, well, on behalf of all the residents of the 48th Ward and members of the zoning committee, we want to thank you for your partnership and doing a great job with zoning. Wish you all the best. That's it.

[Speaker 1] (9:25 - 10:46)
Thank you. Motion to pass, one recommended, Mr. Towny. Chairman Towny.

Okay, all righty. Thank you, Alderman. And Alderman Osterman makes the motion to move to pass.

Any objections? Hearing on the ordinance is passed. All right.

Next, we're on document number 02022-1753, amendment of municipal code section 14X-8-803.2, by modifying pooling requirements for nursing homes and senior housing facilities. The item has a substitute. All members of the committee should have received a copy of the substitute, as well as a summary electronically.

And at this time, I would ask for a motion to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Can I get a motion on the substitute, please? So moved on the substitute.

Vice-chair Roboyes moves to accept the substitute. Any objections? Hearing none, the substitute is before us.

We have the sponsoring Alderman here, Alderman committee member Haddon, as well as Commissioner Beaudet here to present the matter. We'll start with Alderman Haddon.

[Speaker 3] (10:48 - 10:52)
Chair, do you mind if we start with Commissioner Beaudet and then I get to follow up? Is that okay?

[Speaker 1] (10:52 - 10:55)
Yes, at your discretion. Now we'll move to Commissioner Beaudet.

[Speaker 4] (10:56 - 15:57)
So good morning, Chairman Toney and members of the committee on zoning landmarks and building standards. My name is Matt Beaudet. I'm the commissioner for the Department of Buildings.

As always with me here today is First Deputy Commissioner Marlene Hopkins and Managing Deputy Commissioner Grant Ulrich. I'm here today to ask your favorable consideration of this package of amendments to provisions of the municipal code regarding heating and cooling requirements. I would like to thank Mayor Lightfoot and Alderman Haddon and others for their leadership on this vital matter.

As disastrous effects of climate change, including heat waves become more frequent and more severe, we must address some of the technical limitations of large building heating and cooling systems to ensure that our most vulnerable large building residents are protected. The substitute ordinance before you, for your consideration accomplishes that. The primary amendment before you would address the challenge posed by the two pipe heating and cooling system, which are common in many large buildings.

The two pipe system has a single fan coil box in each of the apartments that is connected to two pipes, a supply and return pipe that run through the walls and serve multiple apartments. The supply pipes can either provide hot water for heating or cold water for cooling. The system cannot supply heating and cooling at the same time.

Attempting to provide hot water to a chiller or cold water to a boiler will break the system. The proper switching of the system between heat mode and cooling mode and vice versa can take one or two days to complete. Thus it is critical to us to devise a solution that acknowledges the limitations of building systems and design a solution to protect residents.

To be crystal clear, the current heating ordinance does not prevent and has never prevented a building owner from disengaging the heating system or engaging the cooling system prior to June 1st at the end of the period when minimum indoor temperatures are mandated. For clarity, the amendment expressly states the ordinance does not prohibit the engagement of the cooling system as long as the required minimum temperatures are maintained. To overcome the one or the other challenge of the two pipe system and also for older buildings without central cooling, the amendment requires that in large buildings and in all 55 plus buildings, those are commonly referred to our senior living facilities, cooling centers be established in an enclosed common gathering area accessible to all residents free of charge when the heat index is 80 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. In most instances, these will be the lounges or the meeting areas in these buildings. Temporary cooling systems such as plug-in windows or portable air conditioners would be required immediately and a separate permanent cooling system independent of the two pipe system would be required to be installed by May 1st, 2024.

The May 1st, 2024 for the permanent system will provide appropriate time to budget funding for materials and labor. To reiterate, these cooling centers would be required for all buildings designated as housing for older persons under the Federal Fair Housing Act or more commonly known as the 55 plus senior independent living buildings. It would also apply to larger buildings that are over 80 feet in height, which are high rise buildings in Chicago or contain more than 100 dwelling units.

As we know, many older residents live in these buildings. These large buildings also have enclosed common areas which would be required to function as cooling centers independent of other cooling systems and heating systems in the building. The ordinance also requires permanent cooling systems and all new construction of residential, institutional and pre-K through 12 buildings.

This simply codifies the existing industry practice as people are not building new construction without air conditioning. Other amendments in this package include allowing a lesser minimum heating temperature of 64 degrees at the start of the heat season, which is September 15th through the October 15th until the nighttime temperature first falls below 45 degrees. Also allows a lesser minimum heating temperature of 64 degrees at the end of the heat season, May 1st through June 1st after the daytime outdoor temperature first exceeds 75 degrees Fahrenheit.

Incorporating best practices to aid in the enforcement of the ordinance, such as requiring the indoor temperature reads be when all windows next to your doors are closed. Setting measurement standards of three feet above the floor and three feet from the walls and setting heat index measurements at the highest of Chicago's three official measurement sites set by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Cleaning up technical language and existing cooling provisions related to licensed assisted living facilities and long-term care facilities.

Again, my thanks to Mayor Lightfoot, Alderman Haddon and the others for their leadership on this vital matter. I believe that the above substitute and other items in the package were provided to the committee members in the one page summary. Thank you for your time.

And I ask for your favorable consideration. And I'm happy to answer any questions. Thank you, chairman.

[Speaker 1] (15:57 - 16:05)
All right. Alderman Haddon, would you entertain questions before or do you want to start the conversation?

[Speaker 3] (16:08 - 16:15)
I'm sure we can entertain some questions before and then if I can just reserve the right to speak, I would appreciate that. Of course.

[Speaker 1] (16:16 - 16:56)
Okay. Before we get to Alderman Hopkins and others, I just have a quick question to the commissioner. So commissioner, obviously we have buildings that are seniors buildings, 55 and over, CHA properties and such.

But the fact that there are a number of buildings that have 100 units or more that are mixed population, what is the difference between those types of buildings and the senior buildings? If you can articulate the differences in this ordinance.

[Speaker 4] (16:58 - 17:36)
Well, there really isn't much difference between the two. They're both normally high rises. Most of them are over 100 units.

They'd qualify, even if it didn't say 55 plus, but we did want to address the 55 plus buildings because we have encountered both heating and cooling issues in those buildings. And those are more vulnerable populations. The commonality between both of those buildings is they're both large buildings.

They both have common areas. And that could easily be converted to cooling centers. And as we know, a number of seniors do live in, in the regular non 55 plus buildings.

[Speaker 1] (17:36 - 18:02)
Right. In terms of outreach, we had somebody from an association come in. What is your, what have you been doing with outreach to like the building managers, people who deal with this situation every day?

I know BOMA is one of them. Realtors is another, but what kind of response and or outreach has the department made to get us to this point?

[Speaker 4] (18:03 - 18:21)
Well, we're happy to work. We always work with the Realtors. We work with BOMA.

We work with a BOMA. We're looking to see if there's other associations out there that specialize in these areas. And we're happy to reach out to them.

If this ordinance is passed and given favorable consideration, we'll work with, work with the community as we always do.

[Speaker 1] (18:21 - 19:03)
So you're basically saying it's fairly, I wouldn't say the word innocuous. It's fairly mild in terms of the substitute. But as you've heard in the public comment period, it was the 10 day plan, the two year plan.

So I'm just, I'm just, I know there'll be a number of questions, but normally it's, we get their input as we make the substitute and not afterwards. So your response to that is it's pretty, pretty tame in relation to, and things that can readily be and more economically achievable.

[Speaker 4] (19:04 - 19:45)
I would say so. I mean, getting the temporary cooling facilities up, that's going to home depots, that's going to Lowe's, that's getting, getting window and portable air conditioning units. The more permanent, that's why we did look at a two year recognizing that there is, there is going to be cost to ramp up for that.

There's going to be labor. There are supply chain issues. That's why we went with two years.

And, you know, the permitting, we're always, always help, always willing to help folks on permitting. I know a lay person is difficult to navigate, but these permits would be, would be applied for by architects. So folks that are used to our system.

[Speaker 1] (19:46 - 19:49)
Is there a minimum size of the cooling area?

[Speaker 4] (19:50 - 19:52)
There's no minimum size.

[Speaker 1] (19:52 - 19:56)
No, that's why we said 10 by 12 rooms, so to speak.

[Speaker 4] (19:56 - 20:05)
Yeah. But most of these, again, when these buildings, most of these have large lounge, they have large meeting rooms. And those are, those are what we're looking at.

[Speaker 2] (20:05 - 20:06)
Okay. All right.

[Speaker 1] (20:08 - 20:10)
Next we'll have Alderman Brian Hopkins.

[Speaker 2] (20:12 - 26:07)
Yeah. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Commissioner Bourdais for explaining a little bit about the dual pipe system and how that works for my colleagues who are not HVAC engineers or are not building maintenance people like myself.

I want to add a little bit of illustration to that that we can all understand because it's relevant to this discussion. For those of you who own a car, you're familiar with the controls on your dashboard. The same knobs tend to control both the heating and the air conditioning.

And in the month of May and in the month of September into October, you might get in your car one morning and turn on the heat. You might get in your car in the next morning and turn on the air conditioning. And you think nothing of that because it's the same controls.

You have the ability to switch back and forth at will. That's fine. But what if in order to change from heat to air conditioning or vice versa, you had to take your car into a mechanic shop, leave it there for a couple of days, possibly up to three days, and then get a bill for over a thousand dollars.

And then possibly more if there's parts that need to be replaced, which happens more often than not during the process of converting from heat to cool. You had to do all that rather than just flip a switch. You would be reluctant to do that more than one time in the spring.

And then again, one time in the fall. And you would also spend a lot of time trying to throw a dart at the calendar and pick the perfect day when you can take it into your mechanic and get that conversion implemented so you remain comfortable. And Chicago being what it is, more often than not, you wouldn't pick the perfect day because frankly, there is no perfect day.

You'd be off by a week or 10 days or whatever. And you would have to put up with a little seasonable uncomfort. You'd either be too hot or too cold or whatever it is.

So that's a pretty good way of looking at the dilemma that building engineers who operate the dual pipe system face. There's nothing to stop them from engaging in that conversion process several times a year other than the inconvenience, the cost, the expense, and frankly, the risk to the system. Because if something's going to break or go wrong, chances are it will go wrong and break during that conversion process when the system has to be depressurized and then pressurized again, valves have to be tested, so on and so forth.

So to Commissioner Bourdais' point, that there's nothing currently in the law that requires dual pipe buildings to keep their heat on and active all the way to June 1st. That is technically correct, but the impact of the law is such that it does require them to do so or face the possibility of having to convert the system, reconvert the system multiple times. So most of them, in order to avoid that, simply keep the heat in active mode, if not actively heating the building until June 1st, because they never know if they turn the heat off, May 15th, let's say, for example, the next week could be an unseasonably cold week and they're going to have to turn it back on in order to comply.

So by virtue of the fact that we have minimum temperature requirements that we're enforcing, it's a de facto requirement for these dual pipe buildings that the heat has to stay on. Now, the relief that I saw, and I introduced some ordinance accordingly, was to give these buildings a little bit of a grace period rather than a hard date of October 15th and June 1st, whereby the systems have to be converted, to allow them to use their own judgment within a 30-day window and convert the system once during that time, using their best judgment, watching Tom Skilling or Cheryl Scott, whoever their preferred weather forecaster is, and try and get it right. Unfortunately, that's not what this ordinance does.

I just got a copy of the ordinance yesterday and I only had an opportunity on short notice to reach out to two such buildings that I'm very familiar with, one in my ward, one in Alderman Riley's ward, both of whom I resided in for a period of time and knew the engineers and knew the process here. They both objected to the proposed change for two reasons. Number one, it doesn't provide that flexibility that they need during the month of May and the month of October.

Now, it imposes two different temperature minimums rather than the one that we currently have, which is a 68-degree temperature minimum that must be required. This substitute ordinance drops that down to 64 degrees, which technically should help them stay in compliance, but it's an additional requirement based on the weather experience. Once again, there's going to be another date that nobody can predict when the minimum temperature requirement will change by four degrees.

That doesn't help and it adds a layer of complexity. I think the intention was, in fact, to help these buildings, but this ordinance misses the mark in that one provision. So for that reason, Mr. Chairman, after the discussion is concluded, I am going to move to defer this. The Chicagoland Apartment Association, who I don't believe was able to sign up to testify, wants to engage in this as the realtors indicated, and BOMA as well. I talked to them last night too. So they all have additional concerns about this one provision, particularly that do need to be worked out.

And I think we just need a couple more weeks to work this out. So I don't want to stand in the way of discussion. I think I see other hands raised and I think we should have a healthy discussion today.

But at the conclusion of that discussion, Mr. Chairman, I will make a motion to defer this matter to the next meeting. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (26:09 - 26:35)
Thank you, Brian. And I know you've got a lot of experience in living in high-rises. But just to conclude, is that a specific question to the commissioner or what is the specific improvement that you're looking to defer this at this point at the end of discussion?

So get down to the crux of what really you would like to see happen.

[Speaker 2] (26:36 - 27:54)
Well, what I would like to see happen would be for buildings to remain in compliance with our requirements for minimum temperature. And I have no problem leaving it at 68. I mean, I think that's a reasonable minimum temperature to expect a dwelling unit to be in.

But the question is, when do they have to meet that? And rather than one, rather than a hard date where they have to meet that, a month, a 30-day period, which is a grace period at either end of the season, the so-called shoulder season, which is the month of May in its entirety and the month of September 15th to October 15th, when they convert into heat, that's when they have to start meeting that minimum heat temperature. But they get to pick the day within that 30-day window of when that is.

So that way they know they only have to convert their system once in the spring and once in the fall. So it's a question of how we would define the universe of buildings that have to meet this, how we would establish that they have picked a date and they would have to have some type of a log where the engineer would say, okay, we're picking May 15th, the building down the street is picking May 20th, so be it. Everybody's gonna have their own.

[Speaker 1] (27:54 - 28:04)
In fact, a lot of- All right, I get it. I get it. Now, Commissioner Bode, any quick response to Alderman Hopkins?

[Speaker 4] (28:05 - 28:30)
We're always happy to work with folks. I think nothing's ever perfect. So picking a date certain, I know being a former prosecutor, that makes it a lot easier to prosecute.

It's gonna be difficult to enforce an ordinance that building A is picked this day, building B picked that day. That'd be another discussion I would have to have with the law department whether they could enforce the ordinance that way.

[Speaker 1] (28:30 - 28:34)
All right. Okay. Alderman Siccio-Lopez.

[Speaker 21] (28:38 - 29:53)
Thank you, Chairman. I just have a quick question. I know that there's a motion, but in terms of what I gather from especially our colleague Alderman Haddon, there has been work very close.

It is a very important issue, especially in city buildings. I think, as the commissioner mentioned, there's a lot of work to be done. I think that we should definitely prioritize this given the extreme weather that we're dealing with right now.

There's an urgent need to take action on the matter. Yes, there's a lot of work to be done in terms of making sure that there's not effects on some of these buildings, the owners and so forth. But I think at this point, what we need to prioritize is the life of our communities, especially seniors.

This is a step in the right direction. I know that we've got to continue working together on making this a much more comprehensive ordinance and approach, but I do think that this is urgent given the current rising temperatures, extreme weather and vulnerable seniors. So I would like to just express my support and the urgency to take action sooner rather than later.

So I urge our colleagues to take action and keep working on this issue together. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (29:53 - 30:00)
Thank you, Alderman Cardona. Thank you, Chairman. This is for...

[Speaker 16] (30:06 - 30:29)
So some of these high-rises, I don't know if you mentioned this, but some of these high-rises, they have windows. And if it's because of the whole changing of the temperature, saying they're still in May and it gets hot like how it was. Did you say that they could put window units on the buildings or go to putting fans?

[Speaker 4] (30:31 - 31:34)
Well, this would be a cooling center. So this isn't in your actual dwelling unit. So again, the challenge of the two-pipe system, which Alderman Hopkins addressed as well, is that the heat's either on or the heat's off.

So if they're worried about turning the heat off in May, they would be required to have a cooling center in the common area, which is usually their lounges, their meeting rooms. So they're not flipping the system back and forth three or four times, as Alderman Hopkins says. They don't need to flip the system back if they choose not to, but they would have to have a cooling center for residents to go down into.

And of course, anybody that wants to, if their building allows them, some people do have window units that they buy themselves and operate, or some have portable air conditioners that they buy themselves and operate that way. So the ordinance addresses a common cooling area, not cooling in each individual unit.

[Speaker 16] (31:35 - 32:52)
Well, I get that, but we have to also think about those seniors that can't really are mobilized, they're immobile. So you got those that are in their wheelchair or they can't really go, or they're almost can't move and so forth. So I can't see them go all the way downstairs to the cooling room or the cooling center, the community room, so they can cool down because it's hard for them to get to that, to the accessible area.

So, I mean, I think we have to really do better on this because the simple fact that I have three senior buildings in my ward and one of them, like I mentioned to you, the husband and wife, one had a heat stroke was because the temperature was not changed to cooling. And I believe the husband ended up going to the hospital and the mother, I mean, the wife, since he takes care of her, she got hurt because he wasn't able to take care of her. So I think we have to do much better.

I believe this is in the right direction, but I think we could still tweak it to empower the residents, especially the seniors and especially those who live in high-rise buildings.

[Speaker 3] (32:54 - 33:01)
Chairman, if I might, I know I said I wanted to speak before we move, but I've got...

[Speaker 1] (33:01 - 33:18)
Okay, Alderman, since you're the sponsor of the ordinance, we're not asking Matt just to be the only respondent. So I will give you that privilege of addressing Alderman Cardona. And if you want at this point, Alderman Hopkins too, I guess.

[Speaker 3] (33:19 - 40:17)
I would love to. Thanks, Chair. So good morning, everybody.

So Alderman Cardona, I want to specifically address your concern. I had the same one, right? I know you and I got to talk, same experience, right?

James Snyder, 10-story building, onsite doing wellness checks. I had that exact experience, right? Of a couple on the 10th floor on the West corner unit, one of the hottest units.

And they hadn't come downstairs to the cooling center that we had them set up because one of them had mobility issues, right? And she was concerned. There was also a language barrier.

So I know I don't use it very frequently, but my Spanish is passable. So I got to go visit them after other people had visited them and just was able to explain to them and then was able to offer them help. They had a wheelchair, just 20 or 30 minutes, right?

One of the big challenges as Alderman Hopkins has illustrated very effectively in buildings like James Snyder with the two pipe systems is the reality of that building's constructed where they couldn't even have air. They couldn't do window units, right? As we're looking to make common sense changes that are going to give people better guidance around decision-making, this isn't going to solve the problem of two pipe building systems.

So what this is going to do is give more guidance and responsibility. The heat index piece is huge on this, right? So actually adding in the national heat index standards to make building managers and owners aware and to also make tenants aware of what the temperatures are is going to make a big difference.

And you'll notice some of the changes here around the dates and the temperature guidelines. This is going to help seniors because a building like that where they're not in control of their own AC, ostensibly that building manager, they should be turning on the AC sooner. So one of the things with your buildings and with the buildings in my ward, Alderman Cardona, is not so much...

The city could say everyone has to have air conditioning, right? And we are saying that for all new buildings, but your buildings and my buildings would already be in compliance technically. They do have air conditioning.

The question is, when are they going to turn on the air conditioning? And in many of the instances, I know it's more of my colleagues that I've spoken to, you guys know the residents call, they say it's hot and they say, oh, the building said they can't turn on the AC yet because it's not June 1st. We are directly addressing that problem, which means that us as older people can be better advocates for our tenants, right?

When they're calling us because now we've got an ordinance that gives buildings those flexibilities, especially the two pipe systems. And so there are also things that we can do and I'll say that there's some kind of work going on in the Climate Action Plan. That's also about, what about buildings that don't have AC?

What about buildings fewer than 100 units? I forget which colleague asked. Chairman Tunney, it might've been you.

I have several senior buildings that aren't 100 units, right? Which is why the 55 plus designation is also important in addition to the 100 unit plus. I know for a lot of our colleagues that are centralized in the city and along the lakefront, you guys do have a lot of these really large buildings.

We don't have many large buildings like that in the 48th Ward. And so this ordinance also can address the 55 plus units while also getting to the high rises. But there is more work to do and that work is gonna be done through how our city is more resilient and adapts to climate change.

Because this ordinance, if it tried to enforce air conditioning, all the time and all the units in a strict way, it wouldn't be very difficult to implement and enforce. And so in this way, I do believe and I really appreciate Commissioner Bode and Grant and Marlene's work in helping us with the substitute. I think it's really gonna make a big difference in our seniors and for other residents.

And then to Alderman Hopkins comments, I really appreciate your thoughtfulness and experience on the two pipe systems. I've had a bit of a crash course myself recently. And what I'll say is not leaving it up thought, the thought of letting a building management system, a condo board, right?

A management company, just kind of leaving, asking us to leave things up to their good judgment in the face of what we just saw, that tragedy at James Snyder, that's a really big ask. And as Commissioner Bode said, we have to have some guidance on dates or else there's no enforcement. I am not at all comfortable with a proposal that would say, hey, buildings have a hundred units or more that have a two pipe system.

We're gonna let you decide when to turn on your heat and cooling because time and again, under our current guidelines, we've seen them make the wrong choices. And in rare cases, those wrong choices cost people their lives. So the guidance in this ordinance is to help them make better choices.

We can't go back and we don't have the funds to do the radical like re-engineering of these two pipe buildings. What we can do and what you'll see in this guidance is strongly encouraging folks when they're considering new construction, maybe consider investing a little bit more in a four pipe system. Maybe it's not as cost-effective, but it's going to make your decision-making easier, especially given the reality of our changing climate.

And so those two pipe systems, respectfully to Alderman Hopkins, you guys, we're here to make better decision-making possible, not to take away the ability for the city to enforce decision-making. So we do give guidance on here. We do give leeway for two pipe systems.

We make it a little easier for them. And the things that we're requesting here are not going to be super cost. They're not going to be a huge cost to building managers, but they are going to pay dividends in safety and rights for our tenants and expectations.

And deferring this another month on a day when we're going to reach 100 degrees, I think would be a very bad call. We've been working on this for a month. We've done lots of research on it.

This is a good ordinance. It will have good impacts. And so I don't know.

I know Alderman Hopkins said he planned to make a motion. Chair, I don't know that that motion's on the floor, but I would move to pass. Right.

[Speaker 1] (40:17 - 40:36)
Okay. Thank you. Chairman, I got a question.

Alderman Cardona. Okay. Quick question, because we've got a couple more of our committee members that have not spoken yet.

Do we have a yearly inspection on the heating and cooling for these buildings every year?

[Speaker 16] (40:36 - 40:56)
The reason I say that because I get like in the fall, winter, some of my buildings saying that they have no heat. Some of the units are not getting heat and so forth. So I was wondering if there's an ordinance that basically holds your feet to the fire that they have to do a yearly inspection or the city has to go out there and make sure that everything is working up to code.

[Speaker 4] (40:56 - 41:01)
There are periodic inspections on boilers and large chillers.

[Speaker 16] (41:03 - 41:07)
Is it enforced? Do we enforce it? It's enforced.

Okay.

[Speaker 4] (41:08 - 41:15)
All right. Unfortunately, sometimes it breaks when the days we're not out there. I get it.

It's just like elevators.

[Speaker 1] (41:17 - 41:24)
You're on the record, Commissioner. I just want to make sure you're all right. Let's go to Alderman Osterman.

[Speaker 30] (41:30 - 41:35)
Commissioner Bode at our apartments.

[Speaker 23] (41:36 - 43:25)
His department has been working on this issue. We just had a very hot week last week and I think his department and the other agencies stepped up their game to increase communication. Support Alderwoman Haddon in this ordinance that was made reference to starting a car.

And the reality is, this is not starting a car. This is a home for a senior citizen. The luxury of just flipping a switch and turning on the AC to 64 degrees.

They are homebound. The lobbyists that are out there on their behalf, they have us in the city to look out for their best interests. So there's an urgency about this.

I am in strong support of that. If Alderman Hopkins wants to, on behalf of the industries, defer this, I don't think that we have the luxury of having the glacial pace of a couple of weeks, given the climate that we have. All of us are going to be at City Hall tomorrow and we can all sit down tomorrow.

I'll book the conference room and if we're going to have those extended conversations, let's do it right away. But about this, because there's a lot of older Chicagoans who their health and their safety is critical and we have to look out for their interests. So I'd like to move this as well.

I think those that care about this interest and the health and safety of the seniors of Chicago, I'll be there tomorrow and we can hash out whatever we got to hash out on an expedited time.

[Speaker 1] (43:26 - 43:34)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Alderman Kerry Austin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 14] (43:34 - 44:43)
Commissioner Bode, my question is in regards to one of my senior builders that I do have. I have three in my ward as well, but it seems to be very difficult to get into to check on the seniors at senior suites. Now we've called Commissioner Hopkins on several occasions regarding abandoned buildings and other activities that have been in vacant buildings or buildings that we thought were abandoned were not because we got the police to check.

But my senior building, there's no way to enter it for an inspection to make sure that everything is on the up and up. I ask this question because one of my senior buildings we thought was in good standard and it wasn't. And that was during the COVID.

So I don't want this to happen to this particular building because we didn't check. So is there any way for us to gain entrance to your department?

[Speaker 4] (44:45 - 45:17)
Sure, we check on the 55 plus buildings regularly. Most of them are very cooperative. They welcome our input on there.

If there's a particular building there where the manager is not letting us in, we can't force our way in, but we can be very persuasive and let folks let us in. If we need to bring the health department and we need to bring family support services with us, we've got some concerns about the seniors in that building. We could do that as well.

But if you give us that address, all the women will be right on top of that one.

[Speaker 14] (45:17 - 46:03)
I sure will because I hate to have anything to happen to my seniors in a building that I can't get in to check on various ones. I have a senior who used to live in the building. That's how I get to check on some of the seniors because I have her to call them and make sure that they're okay.

But as to say that, excuse me, I send the individuals there to make sure that everything is okay. And that's almost sometimes impossible. So, oh, yes.

And do we have any other individual assigned to us as aldermen besides Commissioner Hopkins? Because Marlene calling you back is like pulling our teeth.

[Speaker 4] (46:04 - 46:15)
Yeah. I mean, the whole team is available to you all. To any member of the council.

So myself, Grant, Marlene, Carl, John, Hal, we're all available.

[Speaker 14] (46:16 - 46:28)
All right, then I'll start off with Carl again. And the nice part is that we had 119th and Eggleston could have been prevented had somebody had called us back.

[Speaker 4] (46:28 - 46:29)
Yeah.

[Speaker 1] (46:30 - 46:32)
All right. Thank you, Commissioner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 4] (46:33 - 46:33)
Thank you, Alderwoman.

[Speaker 1] (46:33 - 46:36)
Thank you, Alderwoman. Alderman Mike Rodriguez.

[Speaker 17] (46:37 - 48:02)
Thank you, Mr. Chair. And to Alderwoman Austin, if you ever need to get in touch with Marlene, let me know. She picks up my phone right away at all times as do you, Commissioner.

And, you know, on a serious note, you know, we need to recognize the loss of fellow Chicagoans recently and some of our seniors. This is very tragic. And I think it's really, really not every committee meeting.

It's very rare when we as city council persons actually have an opportunity to do something immediately on a challenge that's facing our residents and do something immediately that actually saves people's lives. So I am not one to delay this effort. I think we need to move forward now.

And I will not stand for letting our residents down and believe that we need to move this today so that tomorrow we pass this in city council. My understanding is BOMA is at the very least fine with what's been presented. And I think that, you know, in the future, if this can be tweaked, that's fine.

But for now, we need to move. And I will be supporting this effort. I thank Alderwoman Haddon for bringing this forward.

And for you, Chairman Tunney, for also presenting this to the committee. Thank you for the opportunity to speak.

[Speaker 4] (48:03 - 48:24)
And thank you, Alderman. And as we did with Alderman Osterman's committee, you know, we do express our condolences to the families of Janice Reed, Gwendolyn Osborne, and Delores McNeely. One of them was younger than I was, than I am.

So, you know, we'd like to do everything we can to help her protect all Chicagoans, especially our vulnerable residents.

[Speaker 1] (48:25 - 48:29)
Thank you, Commissioner. Alderman Keppelman.

[Speaker 25] (48:30 - 49:14)
Thank you, Chairman. On the face of it, I really like this ordinance. It sounds very reasonable and it protects our Chicagoans.

So I get all that. My understanding, and I want to just clarify this with you, Commissioner. I think the crucial time that we believe people are at risk for dying are May and also in October.

May has passed. And so we have some time to plan for October when the heat should go on and when it should remain off. Am I correct on that?

[Speaker 4] (49:17 - 49:37)
Yes, Alderman. So the heat season has already passed. So folks that wish to engage their cooling systems are free to do so.

And this also addresses the buildings without cooling systems. As Alderman Hedges said, we could have emergency cooling facilities in those buildings.

[Speaker 25] (49:38 - 49:55)
So the way the current process is right now is that if there's already a system in place so that no one's at risk for dying if we're following the ordinance right now because we're now past June 1st, correct?

[Speaker 4] (49:55 - 49:59)
Yes. So there should be nobody that says they cannot engage their cooling system if they have one.

[Speaker 25] (49:59 - 50:55)
Okay, I say all that because I'm hearing from some of my colleagues this is a crisis. If we don't act now, people will die. But it sounds like that's not quite the case.

So good. I wanted to clarify that. And then the other thing is we have the RLTO which has a strict liability clause that means that if a judge finds fault, a landlord at fault that the judge is required, mandated to give the strictest punishment as possible, fines, and I don't know about this, does the RLTO play at all in this proposal?

Is it putting the landlord, tugging them in both directions where it's a lose-lose? But I'm asking because I don't know.

[Speaker 4] (50:56 - 51:30)
Yeah, no, I would say no. There is the cooling center provision which the crisis really hasn't passed because some buildings don't have air at all. So in those larger buildings, they would have to have a cooling center and they've got the opportunity to establish that.

So they would have to have a cooling center. If they fail to have a cooling center, the RLTO may or may not kick in depending on the situations of each building and each rental agreement.

[Speaker 25] (51:31 - 51:38)
Okay, so it sounds like we've passed our crisis point. Okay, that's good to know. Thank you.

Thank you, Chair.

[Speaker 1] (51:40 - 51:44)
Thank you, Alderman. Alderman Raymond Lopez.

[Speaker 5] (51:47 - 53:39)
Good morning, Chairman and members of the committee. Good morning, Commissioner and all. A few quick questions.

And first off, let me just start by saying something. That I support my colleague, Maria Hadden. What we saw happen in her ward is a travesty.

What I don't like hearing is that somehow that we're not here concerned about Chicagoans. We are all here concerned about Chicagoans. We are all here concerned about preventing the next tragedy.

And to say otherwise and trying to make it sound like other people are not here for that reason is very disrespectful. In tone to this conversation. This is about doing what's best for our residents to keep them safe.

And as our colleague just said, we missed the mark when we should have done this and addressed this beforehand because we weren't thinking about the possibilities of emergency. But now we're acting to try and correct this for the second round when there's the emergency, when an emergency may happen later in the year. So I just want to say that on record because I find it very distasteful at this point.

Commissioner, I have a few questions if I may. I'm trying to get through this ordinance just to see, but a couple of things jump out at me and forgive me. Because I do know that in part, this deals both with the senior living and assisted living buildings as well as residential, correct?

We approach them in two separate tracks in this ordinance. That's correct. Okay.

So how much of the assisted living, senior living, long-term care facilities, such, how much of this should be regulated by the state? Or are we able to do this simply because of home rule?

[Speaker 4] (53:40 - 53:46)
We could do this because of home rule. They do also have state and federal regulations on assisted living facilities.

[Speaker 5] (53:46 - 54:06)
Now, what do the state and federal regulations have to say with regards to this? I'm assuming we're stricter than they are because Chicago is always better at protecting people than the state usually or the federal government. But are they stricter?

Is there recourse if they are failing in maintaining the regulations as they have them?

[Speaker 4] (54:07 - 54:18)
So I apologize. I'm not aware if the federal or the state regulates, mandates air conditioning and assisted living facilities. We do in the city of Chicago.

And we've done prior to this ordinance.

[Speaker 5] (54:18 - 54:21)
Is there anyone from the law department that can answer that question?

[Speaker 4] (54:25 - 54:27)
I'm not sure the law department's on this call, Alderman.

[Speaker 5] (54:28 - 54:37)
Chairman, is the law department on this call seeing as they're part of this ordinance? Do we have Mr. Siegel on the call from law?

[Speaker 29] (54:38 - 54:42)
Good morning, Chairman. Mark Siegel from the Department of Law here.

[Speaker 5] (54:44 - 54:44)
Good morning.

[Speaker 29] (54:45 - 54:46)
Good morning. Good morning, Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 1] (54:49 - 54:53)
Mr. Siegel, did you understand the question or do you want to repeat it?

[Speaker 29] (54:54 - 54:55)
I understood the question. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (54:55 - 54:55)
Okay.

[Speaker 29] (54:56 - 55:17)
I'm not familiar. The man's blamed. I got it.

I haven't looked into whether there is federal or state regulation on this issue. That hasn't come up at this point, no. So I'm not sure.

We can certainly look into that for you if you'd like.

[Speaker 5] (55:18 - 55:22)
Chairman Hadden, do you have an answer? I saw your hand come up, so I'll...

[Speaker 3] (55:22 - 55:25)
Chairman Toney, do you mind if I chime in on the nursing home question?

[Speaker 5] (55:26 - 55:28)
Of course. Alderwoman Hadden.

[Speaker 3] (55:29 - 56:25)
Alderman Lopez, I'll say I have a ton of nursing homes and assisted living facilities, so I can't speak to the federal regulation piece, but I will say there are state laws requiring their air conditioning. And one of the things in working on this ordinance with buildings was that we already had something basically pretty much matching what the state required for cooling in nursing homes. What's added is our provision on the 55 plus, but I can say on the state level, at least, because we do engage with our state partners quite a bit in serving our residents in the nursing homes and assisted living facilities, that the requirement for air conditioning was already mandatory.

And I believe there must be some federal match because even in the construction of their facilities, it's what they're required to do. But that protection at the state level does not extend to the 55 plus buildings. And so that part's new within our ordinance here for the city.

[Speaker 5] (56:29 - 57:26)
All right, thank you. Thank you, Alderman Henn. I appreciate that.

The question that I raised is because I wanna make sure that we're not duplicating efforts on multiple levels. I think there should be some consistency. And I know that for setting the bar for other things and hopefully the state follows through and follows our example in trying to address some of these issues.

While I have the law department on board and the department of buildings, you know, the question I have then is how many buildings, the next question I have is how many buildings are we talking about that will be impacted by the implementation of this ordinance? And I say that both in terms of moving forward, but also I know that there's a bullet point here with regards to the retroactiveness of this ordinance. So how many will be impacted in total?

[Speaker 4] (57:28 - 57:32)
So we can get you a number for that, Alderman, through the chair.

[Speaker 8] (57:32 - 57:33)
Roughly speaking.

[Speaker 4] (57:34 - 57:44)
Roughly, I'm not sure how many high-rises, you know, I don't wanna give it an incorrect answer of how many high-rises or how many 100 plus or how many 55 plus buildings we have.

[Speaker 5] (57:45 - 58:50)
Well, I do think that is fairly significant, chairman, especially as we look at the fact that all of this must be done in less than 11 months time. So we're asking for 100 buildings, 200 buildings, 500 buildings, you know, that matters, especially when we're asking in a time when we're already having difficulties trying to secure necessary materials just for building purposes overall. And now we're gonna send 300 buildings or more into a panic when we're already seeing issues of logistics and supply and telling them they only have 11 or excuse me, not 11 months, forgive me, less than two years, 23 months to get it done.

Are there any considerations in this ordinance if they are unable to get that because of issues beyond their control?

[Speaker 4] (58:51 - 59:02)
We always work with folks when there are issues like that, especially if we have to reexamine the supply chain, if something hits there, you know, we're flexible.

[Speaker 5] (59:06 - 59:35)
Commissioner, I understand the department's flexibility. We've seen it work, but I also know saying we're flexible and saying we can be persuasive in the same testimony, I'm sure gives people chills when we're trying to come up with a consistent way to address this issue. And we're not talking about cheap installation.

What do we expect the projected costs to be for these upgrades?

[Speaker 4] (59:36 - 59:52)
Depending on the building size could be five to 10,000 to retrofit the cooling centers. So 100 unit building would be $5,000? It could be five to 10, depending on the size and the number of their common areas.

[Speaker 5] (59:55 - 1:01:54)
Well, I believe that there's some information that we need, some data points that we need just to better understand the impact that this is gonna have on those that provide housing to residential areas and residential communities upwards as opposed to lot by lot. And I think that we're not gonna get all those answers today. And it really concerns me that we have outstanding questions but are still moving forward in a rush manner when the emergency part of this has already passed.

I believe in this ordinance, but I also believe in getting the information we need to move forward. So chairman, if there's a way that we can have more robust discussions and not try to force this in one day when we just barely got all the information, I'm happy to go that route. And if we need to come back to meet, even if it's in a special meeting to pass this, then so be it, we can do that.

We can do it virtually, but let's make sure we're not just rushing and not thinking through all the impacts, especially when we don't know how many buildings will be impacted. We don't know how much latitude businesses are gonna have to try and get through the metrics, trying to work through logistics. And to be quite frank, how the law department's even gonna assist the building department.

Because the law department is already strained as it is, trying to figure out how to deal with vacant properties. As someone who doesn't have a lot of high-rises, but has a lot of vacant properties, I know what it's like trying to coordinate between buildings and law to get on the same page to enforce the laws that we already have on the books. Oftentimes there's breakdowns.

And if we have breakdowns there for a vacant property, I don't wanna see those breakdowns in execution of the laws that we pass happen when there are hundreds of thousands of lives on the line.

[Speaker 3] (1:01:55 - 1:01:56)
Thank you, Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 5] (1:01:56 - 1:01:57)
That has to be resolved. Thank you.

[Speaker 3] (1:01:58 - 1:02:01)
All right. Point of clarification, Chair. Point of clarification.

[Speaker 1] (1:02:01 - 1:02:07)
All right. Just on a point of clarification, because we've got a few people that have not spoken on their first try.

[Speaker 3] (1:02:07 - 1:03:08)
Absolutely. Honest point of clarification, because this has come up a few times and I appreciate my colleagues asking this. Commissioner Bode did mention it, but I think Alderman Kappelman didn't actually get...

Based on your response, James, I don't think you took the answer. So the urgency piece, I know we talked about the end of the heat season, but what is in this ordinance if we pass this through council this month would also be a requirement for those cooling centers, which like you, Alderman Lopez, I don't have a lot of high-rises. I have a ton of buildings that don't have necessarily built-in main systems.

So for those 55 plus senior buildings that I've got that are under 100 units, the requirement for a cooling center would make a difference in people's lives like next week. And I know people did ask that, and I think it's a great question, but if there would be something beyond the heat season time period, that would have an immediate impact on folks on requirements for cooling centers in some spaces where they don't currently exist. And I just wanted to make that clarification.

[Speaker 5] (1:03:09 - 1:03:23)
Thank you, Alderman. Alderman, the chairman, if I may ask, is there any thought then on bifurcating this ordinance so that you could address the immediate need now and some of the other long-term structural issues a month from now?

[Speaker 3] (1:03:24 - 1:03:32)
There's always an opportunity for that. I think we were really trying to be as comprehensive as possible sooner, but let's give the chair back his floor.

[Speaker 1] (1:03:32 - 1:03:47)
Right, and there is a motion- Just throwing that out there. There was an earlier motion by Alderman Hopkins to defer. So we will entertain that as we try to get through the rest of the testimony on the first round.

All right, Alderman Pat Dowell.

[Speaker 11] (1:03:50 - 1:04:20)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. To the sponsor of this ordinance, Maria Haddon, thank you for your leadership on this. I'm someone that has dozens of senior nursing home, high-rise buildings, mid-rise buildings.

So I appreciate your work on this. I have a question for you, Commissioner. Can you give me the rationale for the reduction from 68 to 64?

[Speaker 4] (1:04:22 - 1:04:43)
That would give them a little bit more flexibility if they wish to power down their system gradually. They can go to 64 degrees. It's not 68.

They won't have to have the system as high as they would like. 64, that number was taken from the World Health Organization as far as what would be an optimal temperature.

[Speaker 11] (1:04:45 - 1:06:06)
Well, I don't know. Black folks are a little more cold-natured than other demographics. So I think some flexibility to...

I would not drop that to 64. I think 68 is a better temperature. I think some people would even, in the African-American community, would probably want it at 72.

But 64 seems a bit low. And that would be the only comment that I have on the ordinance. And would like to know if the sponsor would be willing to move that number back to 68, which was what was in the ordinance, the original ordinance.

That's one. Number two, Commissioner, can you speak to how your elevator inspections are going with these senior high-rise buildings? I'm just curious about how up to speed we are.

Do we have enough people? Because if we have an emergency, people need to make sure that their elevators are in proper working order.

[Speaker 4] (1:06:07 - 1:06:29)
I'm just curious to know how that's going within the department. Sure, Alderwoman. Thank you for that question.

We do always prioritize our senior and vulnerable buildings. So we do have our elevator folks out there. More and more, we do work closely with the CHA to make sure the CHA has the mechanics on staff to make sure that those elevators are functioning.

[Speaker 30] (1:06:32 - 1:06:34)
How many elevator inspectors do you have?

[Speaker 4] (1:06:36 - 1:06:44)
At the top of my head, I'm... Sorry, I don't know at the top of my head. I can look it up real quick.

[Speaker 11] (1:06:44 - 1:06:56)
And the number of buildings that you inspect on an annual basis, the number of buildings in the universe are requiring inspection in these categories that we're considering today.

[Speaker 4] (1:06:57 - 1:06:58)
I'll get that to you. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:06:59 - 1:07:00)
You'll get that through the CHA. Yes.

[Speaker 11] (1:07:01 - 1:07:09)
That's fine. Chairman, is there any appetite to put that 64 back to 68?

[Speaker 1] (1:07:11 - 1:07:20)
Well, okay. Let me have the sponsor of the ordinance just quickly entertain the request by Alderwoman Dowell.

[Speaker 3] (1:07:21 - 1:08:23)
Alderwoman Dowell, thank you for the question. I will say that 64 temperature is actually just specific to two pipe systems and only during these grace periods. So the 68 degree temperature that's been the standard remains the standard for everyone.

But what you'll see in section seven is like it's just this exception of giving 64 that reduced temperature between September 15th and October 15th and between May 1st and June 1st for two pipe systems. So this is with that recognition that it will give them a little bit more time as we talked about how it takes a couple of days for those building systems to change over and to help ensure that they don't have to be forced with the situation of switching back. So the 64 is in that, just in that small time window where it's already just still kind of warm or getting warm and only for those buildings, but it is 68 for everybody else during the heating season.

And that has not changed. If that helps for clarification.

[Speaker 11] (1:08:24 - 1:08:28)
Thank you for the clarification. It does. Thank you all.

Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 4] (1:08:28 - 1:08:33)
And I know Alderman, we have 13 elevator inspectors, which includes supervisors.

[Speaker 11] (1:08:34 - 1:08:40)
Okay. For how many buildings in this category that's under this ordinance?

[Speaker 4] (1:08:42 - 1:08:45)
Well, that'd be for the whole city. We have 13 for the whole city.

[Speaker 11] (1:08:46 - 1:08:55)
Right. I know. But how many buildings in this category will be required to have those kinds of inspections?

[Speaker 4] (1:08:55 - 1:08:56)
We can get that through the chair.

[Speaker 1] (1:08:57 - 1:08:58)
Right. That's what I'm looking for. Thank you.

[Speaker 4] (1:08:59 - 1:09:00)
Thanks. Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 7] (1:09:00 - 1:09:01)
Alderman Riley.

[Speaker 4] (1:09:03 - 1:09:04)
Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 7] (1:09:04 - 1:10:11)
And I also want to applaud Alderman Hadden for taking up this important issue. And I completely understand what she's looking to accomplish here. Actually, as we were debating this, I went online and did a little searching around and found that our federal law regulating nursing homes and long-term care facilities requires an interior temperature between 71 and 81 degrees.

It's under Title 42, developed by the US Department of Health and Human Services to protect the well-being of the elderly. That said, has the law department looked at that to understand how that squares up with our ordinance, with the understanding that typically home rule authority can pass laws that are stricter than state or federal, but not vice versa? Could some of the law department answer that for me?

[Speaker 29] (1:10:12 - 1:10:17)
Hi, Alderman. This is Mark Segal from the law department. Could you repeat that one more time for me, please?

[Speaker 7] (1:10:17 - 1:11:06)
Yeah, sure. So, and again, I guess maybe it requires a little bit further examination, but I just in casually searching the internet found Title 42 by the Department of Health and Human Services, the federal department, that requires an interior temperature for nursing homes and long-term care facilities to be maintained between 71 and 81 degrees. I didn't know that until I searched for it.

But with the understanding of how home rule authority works, stricter federal or state law supersedes our own. So how would that square up with this ordinance? And whether it's changed or not, we've always had, it appears, a less strict minimum temperature requirement than this federal rule.

Could you speak to that?

[Speaker 29] (1:11:08 - 1:11:20)
I'm not familiar with the rule you're referencing, Alderman. I'm happy to look into it. And that's something we can certainly look into and get your response to through the chair.

[Speaker 7] (1:11:21 - 1:14:04)
Okay, I think that'd be helpful for everybody. Look, I support 90% of what this ordinance does, but I do have some concerns related to the heat provision. And since we have gotten through the first of the city's heat risks for our vulnerable population, as far as the code applies, I am eager to get these cooling centers in place, as Alderperson Haddon said.

But Alderman Hopkins and myself and a few others represent a lot of high-rise dwellers and also condo associations. And so it seems that if there is the urgent need for the cooling centers, which I don't dispute, but there is a concern, just to understand better how this would impact our vertical populations in some of our wards, I don't wanna stop progress on the immediate threat. But I would love to get some answers from the law department on some of the questions asked today to make sure that we get this part right related to the heat provisions, because it does impact hundreds of thousands of people who live in those structures.

And so, I think it may have been Alderman Tunney, Chairman Tunney, I think at the very beginning said that it's not often we pass an ordinance and then work with impacted stakeholders. Typically those things happen concurrently. And I would just say that if we could divide this question today and set aside that piece that needs to be resolved, but get all the other good things in this ordinance done today, I'm all for that.

But I would hate to go and pass an ordinance that has such an impact on a whole lot of folks without them being able to weigh in on it. I know that there is no formal professional association for condominium owners. And I think this will come as a surprise to many.

So I would just ask like some of my other colleagues that we, even if we come back in a week to pass this or divide it today, that would allow me to support this ordinance. But I just think it's a mistake for us as a matter of policy to pass this ordinance and have a department agree to be flexible. That's just not reassuring enough to me.

So I guess those were the two options, Chairman, that I would throw out there is either divide this ordinance today and pass the stuff we all agree on, or take a week so we can address this one provision that some of us have concerns about. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:14:05 - 1:14:32)
Thank you, Alderman Riley. So as far as first round of committee members, we have heard, I do have a number, I have second round Alderman Hopkins. I think Alderman Raymond Lopez has his hand up for a second.

And then I'm gonna ask Alderman Woman Haddon to conclude and let's keep moving. Thanks. So Alderman Hopkins.

[Speaker 2] (1:14:33 - 1:18:35)
Yeah, thank you, Chairman Sonny. You know, extreme temperatures in Chicago as we've tragically seen is potentially life-threatening, but it isn't just heat. Frankly, every year we have anywhere from 20 to 30 Chicagoans die of hypothermia.

They literally freeze to death, typically in the months of December, January. And of course, we all recall the tragic heat wave of 95 and death on an unprecedented scale. And the tragic loss of life at James Schneider is a reminder of that.

So I'm fully cognizant of the safety measures that permeate this ordinance and that motivated from it. And of course, I support it. But it's the one provision that requires mandatory heat in May and September that is the cause of my request for further study.

You know, nobody freezes to death in May in Chicago. That's not a risk. So when I talk about the need to further examine how we're approaching that, unlike the other provisions of Alderman Haddon's ordinance that are definitely relevant to today when we have a heat wave going on, that one section is certainly not an urgent pressing matter.

And it's been suggested here, if we could pull that one section out, that's the only objection that I have to the entire ordinance is that one section. So if there's a way to do that, that would certainly resolve my concerns. And I speak to this matter with a considerable amount of personal experience.

As I mentioned, I lived in two different buildings that had this dual pipe system. And in one of those two buildings, I was, for a couple of years, I was actively involved in the committee that made the decision twice a year when to convert. So I can tell you from personal experience how difficult it is to pinpoint the exact day when you can make that decision and have everyone satisfied.

But in most cases, it's a question of personal comfort. It's not a question of life and death. And the engineers, the property managers, the people involved in making this decision twice a year in the condo buildings in my ward and in Alderman Riley's ward, I assure you have the best interests of their residents at heart.

They try to make this difficult decision given the variances of Chicago weather. They study Farmer's Almanac type of reports, projections for what's gonna happen, two to 10 day forecast, all of that, trying to make the decision for the comfort and safety of their residents. And they're best equipped to do it because as I said previously, a lot of these buildings have unique characteristics, almost personalities that only their building engineers are going to fully appreciate and understand.

One side of the building gets more sun than the others, so it's hotter. Some of the higher floors get more sun because of the shadow from a building next door. So all these little variances are actually relevant on a micro level.

And for us to mandate a one size fits all solution for these dual pipe buildings for when they have to convert is part of the problem here. And that's why the flexibility that I'm seeking here is that 30 day period when they can make the best decision for their residents. And I agree with Alderman Dow, to provide flexibility in terms of the minimum temperature is probably not the best way to go about it.

64 degrees is noticeably cooler than 68 degrees and people would probably want to be a little bit warmer rather than to have a week when they're experiencing colder temperatures at night and they've got to bundle up under the wool comforter or whatever it is.

[Speaker 1] (1:18:36 - 1:18:48)
So Brian, I'm gonna ask you to conclude on this so we can hear from Haddon and then either take the motion to defer or both the ordinance up or down. So you wanna just make a final comment, Brian?

[Speaker 2] (1:18:49 - 1:19:14)
Yeah, thank you. So I think there's been some misunderstanding of my objection. It is based solely on the requirement that we provide heat in May and heat in September and how we do that.

I think there's a solution here. The buildings I talked to think there's a solution here, but that isn't in this ordinance and we need to put it in there so we can support this in its entirety. So with that in mind, Mr. Chairman, I would move to defer this matter.

[Speaker 1] (1:19:14 - 1:19:20)
All right. To conclude, the sponsor of the ordinance, Alderwoman Haddon.

[Speaker 3] (1:19:21 - 1:19:53)
Thank you, Chair. I wanna ask for my colleagues, Hopkins and Riley and Lopez who have mentioned this kind of splitting it out. I'm wondering, are you specifically speaking to the changes to sections 14X-8-802-2.2, the heat to be provided, the entirety of that section of holding that piece, but passing the rest of it, any one of you?

[Speaker 30] (1:19:54 - 1:19:56)
Yes, that's the section.

[Speaker 3] (1:20:01 - 1:20:37)
I'm certainly open to that, Chair. I do want to take action on the parts that are gonna immediately impact people and that's definitely within the cooling to be provided provisions. And I would love to be able to have something that everybody can support.

I know we had over 30 co-sponsors on this. And so if my colleagues are saying that they want some more time to work on the section that's not immediately impacted, I'm very open to that. If Commissioner Bode is open to that as well, because I know his team put a lot of work into this.

[Speaker 1] (1:20:38 - 1:21:24)
Okay, so if you're amenable, amenable, I should say, to strike a certain provision, I'm gonna hold this right now so we can draft whatever you're comfortable with, departments there, and be it successfully amended and passed today. So we're gonna have to wait till we get through the regular agenda and then get back on the substitute of the substitute, I guess. So, all right.

Is that okay, Commissioner Bode and Alderwoman Haddon? We'll get it done today if it's possible. Is that okay with Commissioner Bode?

[Speaker 4] (1:21:25 - 1:21:32)
And just for clarity, we only speaking of 14X-8-802 and nothing else?

[Speaker 3] (1:21:32 - 1:21:46)
I believe, I want them to clarify, but I believe that's what they're talking about. So that system that is heating systems, everything else that is my understanding. So speak now, you guys, while we work on the substitute, if that's what you're speaking to.

[Speaker 1] (1:21:47 - 1:21:56)
Okay, we heard from Alderman Hopkins, Raymond Lopez, and I think Riley were the...

[Speaker 2] (1:21:59 - 1:22:03)
It's on page four and page five. That section stills under page five.

[Speaker 3] (1:22:06 - 1:22:11)
Okay, yeah. So just the heating systems. Okay.

Yes, Commissioner, that's the section they're talking about. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:22:12 - 1:22:27)
Commissioner? I'm good with it. Okay, Commissioner, you're ready to give us the revised or is there any...

Well, we need to see it in writing. So I need to see the substitute. I don't wanna do it without seeing it.

Okay, so.

[Speaker 4] (1:22:27 - 1:22:28)
Sure, we'll work on that right now.

[Speaker 1] (1:22:28 - 1:22:35)
Okay, all righty. Alderwoman Dow, do you have a question on that? Cause we're gonna hold this.

[Speaker 11] (1:22:36 - 1:22:44)
I'm still pushing for increasing the temperature, putting it back to 68.

[Speaker 3] (1:22:44 - 1:23:03)
That section, we're gonna hold that part. And then what I'll recommend is with the Commissioner and my colleagues, we can get a meeting together next week to go over this section and look at some of those changes. So the proposal that you've got in there, Chairman Dow would also be in that section.

[Speaker 1] (1:23:04 - 1:25:24)
All right, thank you. All right. Okay, so I'm gonna hold this until the end of the meeting.

All right, all right. Let's go on to large signs. Is that correct?

Yes. Okay, moving on. We have large signs over 100 square feet in area 24 feet above grade.

We'll hear them all together. I'll read the ward followed by the address and take a motion at the end. In the first ward, one sign located at 1431 North Claremont.

Four signs in the 26th ward located at 1044 North Francisco. One sign in the 27th ward located at 325 South Palina. Also in the 27th ward, one sign located at 167 North Green.

Also in the 27th ward, one sign located at 315 West Walton. One sign located in the 32nd ward located at 2775 North Elston. Two signs in the 36th ward located at 2150 North Cicero Avenue.

One sign in the 39th ward located at 5035 West Lawrence. And lastly, one sign in the 42nd ward located at 651 West Washington Boulevard. Any questions by committee members?

Can I get a motion to move? Do pass by the same roll call that was- Do pass, Mr. Chairman. Chairwoman Dowell makes the motion to move.

Do pass. Any objections to her motion? Hearing none, the orders are passed.

Okay. We'll now move on to the regular agenda in an effort to minimize technical difficulties and to ensure the committee meeting runs as smoothly as possible. The typical order in which items will be heard has been updated throughout the duration of virtual committee and zoning meetings.

Items will be grouped together according to witness attorney and will be heard in that order rather than in the typical ward order. All right, Aldermanics, do we have my vice chair, Raboyas? Ariel?

Okay, I'll skip to that. We'll go on the regular- Okay, would you mind taking the chair for the Aldermanic in 44, please, on page two?

[Speaker 6] (1:25:27 - 1:25:29)
Tom, I don't have the information in front of me.

[Speaker 1] (1:25:29 - 1:26:30)
Okay. We'll get it to you and then we just- Yeah, we'll just get it. Okay, no problem.

We'll get there. All right, back to page one. Document number A8749 in the 11th ward.

The ordinance was referred on May 23rd of 2022. Common address 2108 through 2148, South Halston Street. Also 801 through 809 West 21st Street and 800 through 810 West Cermak Road.

The change request from B33 Community Shopping District, C12 Neighborhood Commercial District and M12 Limited Manufacturing Business Park District all to a B32 Community Shopping District. Alderman Lee on this item in the 11th ward. Alderman Lee, you're muted.

[Speaker 26] (1:26:30 - 1:26:37)
You wanna unmute? There we go. Sorry about that.

Good morning, Chair. Thank you, everybody.

[Speaker 3] (1:26:37 - 1:26:50)
I'm seeking this zoning change to eliminate the obvious nonconformity on the stretch of Halstead so that we can provide some consistency in zoning for the West side of Halstead between 21st and Cermak.

[Speaker 1] (1:26:52 - 1:26:55)
All right, so tell us about the nonconformity.

[Speaker 3] (1:26:56 - 1:27:30)
You're saying you said it's obvious, so- Yeah, so we've got M3, I'm sorry, M1-2, C1-2 and B3-3 along the same stretch of the block there. There's no manufacturing going on in that section of the street on Halstead. Most of those are already sort of commercial in use.

So just trying to bring that all in line with what's surrounding across the street is a B3-3 as well. So just trying to get everything on the same page.

[Speaker 1] (1:27:31 - 1:27:46)
So it's mostly commercial and you wanna make it sure that it's zoned properly for what's around. Okay, all right, questions for the Alderwoman? No questions by committee members.

Do I get a motion to move to pass for the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 3] (1:27:47 - 1:27:48)
So moved, Alderwoman Hatton.

[Speaker 1] (1:27:48 - 1:28:57)
Alderwoman Hatton makes the motion. Any objections to her motion? Hearing none, this item is passed.

Thank you, Chair. Okay, middle of page one, document number A8747, 22nd Ward. Ordinance was referred on March 23rd of 2022.

And the common address is 3425 West 31st Street. The change request from an M12 limited manufacturer. From an M12, hello, who is this?

It's Alderman. All right, all right. Okay, let me start over.

We're on the middle of page one. A8747, 22nd Ward. Ordinance was referred on March 23rd of 2022.

The change of common address is 3425 West 31st Street. And the change request from M12 limited manufacturing business park district and M33 heavy industry district. All to an M11 limited manufacturing district.

Alderman Rodriguez, Mike.

[Speaker 17] (1:28:58 - 1:30:22)
Yes, thank you, Mr. Chair. The new St. Anthony Hospital and Cinespace movie studios have moved in, will be moving in just to the east of this property, these properties. And in an effort to regulate the proper zoning in this area, we've decided to down zone in this area at the behest of the one and only Steve Valenziano, who we admire greatly and will be missing into the future.

He's done some great work, but including on this. So we wanna make sure that there's a good reflection of proper zoning in this area where we're going from heavy industry that's right down the street from residents to lighter industry that is more in line with what our plans are in this part of our community. And we have brought this before our zoning committee with no objection and also before the business owners in this area with no objection.

So we're happy that we're moving this forward and creating much better industrial zone close to residents in Little Village. So I ask favorable consideration of my colleagues. Thank you, Mr. Chair.

[Speaker 1] (1:30:23 - 1:31:06)
Thank you, Alderman. Questions for the Alderman? If not, can I get a motion to move do pass for the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

So moved by Alderman Cardona. Alderman Cardona makes the motion. Any objections to his motion?

Hearing none, the item is passed. All right, bottom of page one, document number A8751, 29th Ward. Ordinance was referred on April 27th of 2022.

Common address is 5050 to 5064 West Harrison Street and the change request from an M12 limited manufacturing business park district to an RT4 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district.

[Speaker 12] (1:31:06 - 1:31:54)
Alderman Taliaferro. Thank you, Chairman. And thank you for presenting this matter before the committee today.

Chairman, this is just a consolidation of zoning. We have a Leland Elementary School who has a rather sizable lot at 5044 West Harrison. And half the lot is zoned RT4 and the other half is zoned M1-2.

This is an effort, Chairman, as I said earlier to consolidate those two separate zoning distinctions into an RT4, which puts it in line with all the other schools that are zoned RT4 throughout the city. All right. And I ask your favorable consideration of your committee.

[Speaker 1] (1:31:56 - 1:32:02)
Thank you, Chris. Just for the record, the address is 5050 through 5064 West Harrison, correct?

[Speaker 12] (1:32:03 - 1:32:06)
That's correct, yes. That's the entirety of the whole school.

[Speaker 1] (1:32:06 - 1:32:15)
Right, I get it, I get it. I thought you said 5044. That's why I wanted to make sure.

Okay. All right. So it's 5050 through 5064 West Harrison.

[Speaker 30] (1:32:15 - 1:32:15)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (1:32:16 - 1:32:33)
Questions, comments? All right. Can I get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

So moved, Mr. Chairman. Alderman Austin. Alderman Austin makes the motion.

Any objections to her motion? Hearing none, this item is passed.

[Speaker 12] (1:32:33 - 1:32:35)
Thank you, Chairman. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:32:35 - 1:32:59)
Top of page two, document number 8752, 33rd Ward. Ordinance was referred on April 27th of 2022. The common address is 2621 West Belmont Avenue.

And the change request from an RM5 residential multi-unit district to an M12 limited manufacturing business park district. Alderman Rodriguez-Sanchez.

[Speaker 26] (1:33:00 - 1:34:16)
Thank you, Chairman, for having this item before committee. So earlier this year, Electrical Audio reached out to us. They are a recording studio, reached out to our office after they discovered that portions of their property had been rezoned to residential back in the 2000s.

And we went back and realized that the property has actually been changed twice. It was changed in the 90s. And then it was changed in the 2000s again.

The first change that was made, we could not find an ordinance for. It's non-existent. The second one, we believe that was a mistake.

So we're just, they have been there forever. They are a recording studio. They plan to continue to be a recording studio and produce phenomenal music for Chicago.

And we just want them, we just want to bring them into compliance. So portions of their property were rezoned, but then it's only a portion of the property. We're trying to bring the whole property to compliance.

It's currently zoned RM-5. And we want to bring it to the original zoning that was M-1-2.

[Speaker 1] (1:34:18 - 1:34:24)
Thank you, Alderwoman. And just for the record, this recording studio has been at this location for a number of years?

[Speaker 30] (1:34:24 - 1:34:25)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (1:34:25 - 1:35:11)
Okay. So at some point they didn't get the notice that there was some kind of zoning change. So obviously that's a mistake, so to speak.

And we're here to correct it. And there'll be no physical changes to anything. No.

All right. Questions, comments for the Alderwoman? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move, do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

So moved, Mr. Chairman. That is my vice chair, Roboyas makes the motion. Any objections to the motion?

Hearing none, this item is passed. Okay. Go back to page two in the middle of the page.

And you are taking over the chair. So I will yield to my vice chair. Okay, thank you.

[Speaker 5] (1:35:12 - 1:35:32)
Thank you, Chairman. We'll go to middle of page two in the 44th ward, automatic file number A-8772, which was referred on May 2nd, 2022 for the address commonly known as 835 West Addison Street.

[Speaker 6] (1:35:32 - 1:35:44)
The change request is an RM5 residential multi-unit district to a B1-3 neighborhood shopping district. Chairman Tunney, you can present on this.

[Speaker 1] (1:35:52 - 1:36:53)
Okay. So since I'm the sponsor of this ordinance, there were, we presented this affordable housing exciting project on Addison. And I think the attorney for this noticed that there was a survey error and the survey had to be redone.

And also the posting was not done on a timely basis. That being said, this is minor. This is basically correcting a couple of small items, but the project itself is moving forward.

I think it's 100% affordable. And our number of units is 38, 39 units of accessible, 100% affordable housing in the 44th ward. So I would ask my committee members for their support on this very modest technical error.

[Speaker 5] (1:36:53 - 1:37:14)
All right, Mr. Chairman, that's a correction that you're doing there. So we can move forward on this. Thank you for that.

There's no questions. Alderman Cardona makes a motion to pass on this item, but the same roll call used to determine quorum. Are there any objections?

Are there any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:37:15 - 1:37:44)
Thank you, vice chair. Bottom of page two, on item number 21036, first ward. Ordinance was referred on May 23rd of 2022.

Common address is 1433 North Fairfield Avenue. And the change request from an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RM4.5 residential multi-unit district. Ximena Castro is the attorney on this private application.

[Speaker 10] (1:37:45 - 1:38:05)
Yes, good morning, chairman and members of the committee. My name is Ximena Castro. I'm the zoning attorney at Acosta-Escar.

And the attorney for the applicant for the matter before you today at 1433 North Fairfield Avenue. At this time, I'd like to amend the application to a type one application, please.

[Speaker 1] (1:38:06 - 1:38:21)
All right, Alderman Cardona moves to amend the application to a type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to the motion? Hearing none, the item is amended to a type one application.

So proceed with that.

[Speaker 10] (1:38:22 - 1:38:59)
Thank you. The subject property is improved with a four-story residential building with three residential dwelling units and a two-car garage. The existing building height is approximately 42 feet to the top of the parapet.

And the applicant proposes to rezone the property from an RS3 to an RM4.5 to add one additional dwelling unit in the basement to convert the building from three to four dwelling units. No additional parking is proposed. The existing height of the building will remain.

And we met with the Alderman and the community and we received a letter of support from the Alderman that the committee should have on file.

[Speaker 1] (1:39:00 - 1:39:08)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman LaSpada. And this is not in the ADU area.

[Speaker 10] (1:39:08 - 1:39:10)
It is not, it is just outside of it.

[Speaker 1] (1:39:10 - 1:40:13)
So that's why we're here. That's why we're here, right. Okay, all right.

Any questions, comments from committee members? As I said, we do have a letter of support from Alderman LaSpada. If not, can I get a motion?

Move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine form on this type one application. So moved. That is Vice Chair Raboias makes the motion.

And had any objections to their motions? Hearing none, this item is passed amended to a type one. All right, next page, top of three, document number 21041, 25th Ward.

Ordinance was referred to May 23rd of 2022. This common address is 1931 through 33 South Jefferson Street and the change request from C12 Neighborhood Commercial District to B23 Neighborhood Mixed Use District. Again, Jimena Castro on this item in the 25th Ward.

[Speaker 10] (1:40:13 - 1:41:27)
Yes, thank you, Chairman. For the record, my name is Jimena Castro, Zoning Attorney at Acosta-Ezgar and attorney for the applicant for the matter before you today at 1931 through 33 South Jefferson. The subject property is comprised of a double lot that is 5,000 square feet and known as 1931 and 1933 South Jefferson Street.

The lot known as 1931 South Jefferson is a vacant lot and the lot known as 1933, which is adjacent is improved with a vacant two-story residential building with two dwelling units and no parking. The applicant proposes to rezone the property as the chairman stated from a C12 to a B23 to split the zoning lots and construct a three-story residential building with three dwelling units and a detached three-car garage on the vacant lot known as 1931 and also to demolish the existing structure at 1933 to also construct a three-story residential building with three dwelling units and a detached three-car garage. The proposed height for both buildings is 42 feet and two inches and we met with the alderman, went through his community process and we have a letter of support from him that the committee should have on file.

[Speaker 1] (1:41:29 - 1:41:36)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Citro Lopez. Alderman Lopez, are you on the call?

[Speaker 21] (1:41:37 - 1:41:47)
Yes, chairman. And we are, as you stated, we went through the local community process and we ask our colleagues for a favorable consideration of this item.

[Speaker 1] (1:41:49 - 1:42:41)
So quickly, alderman, you're demoing a two-flat and building two three-flats on a 50-foot lot. Is that correct? Correct.

Okay. All right. Questions, comments?

Can I get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? So moved by Alderman Cardona. Alderman Cardona makes the motion.

Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, this item is passed. Moving on to document number 21037, 28th Ward.

Ordinances occurred on May 23rd of 2022. Common address is 4225 through 29 West Madison Street and the change request from a B32 Community Shopping District to a B23 Neighborhood Mixed Use District. Jimena Castro again.

[Speaker 10] (1:42:42 - 1:43:33)
For the record, my name is Jimena Castro, zoning attorney at Acosta-Escar, attorney for the applicants for the matter before you today, like the chairman stated at 4225 through 29 West Madison Street. For background, the subject property is a vacant lot. The applicant proposes to rezone the property from a B32 to a B23 to construct a three-story mixed-use building with approximately 2659 square feet of ground floor commercial space, eight dwelling units above the ground floor and eight rear surface parking spaces.

The proposed height of the building will be approximately 42 feet and nine inches to the top of the parapet. And we work with the alderman on this matter. He has reviewed the proposed project and he has issued a letter of support, which the committee should have on file.

[Speaker 1] (1:43:37 - 1:43:44)
All right. Let me just see. We have Alderman Irvin on the call.

Jason, do you want to comment on this item, please?

[Speaker 6] (1:43:46 - 1:44:19)
Good morning. Good morning. Ah, great day.

Great Tuesday. Great day after Juneteenth. It's all good.

Now, I had a chance to meet with the applicant and what they're attempting to do. Darryl Madison's lot's been vacant forever. And this development, I think, will enhance the quality of living of residents and bring forth some needed new retail and residential space along the Madison corridor.

And I ask for favorable consideration from the committee. Thank you, sir. Thank you.

Thank you, Alderman Irvin.

[Speaker 1] (1:44:19 - 1:44:27)
Any questions for the applicant or the alderman? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move to pass on the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 18] (1:44:27 - 1:44:29)
Move to pass, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:44:29 - 1:44:38)
Alderman Wagesack makes the motion. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

All right. Thank you all.

[Speaker 29] (1:44:38 - 1:44:45)
And have some, get some pep in your step, guys. Wake up. It's good.

It's a nice day today. Well, you missed some of the excitement.

[Speaker 1] (1:44:45 - 1:44:51)
It was a little heated in the earlier part. I know it was heated. Yeah.

We tried to get cool around here.

[Speaker 30] (1:44:51 - 1:44:52)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (1:44:52 - 1:45:09)
Let's get cool around here. All right. Y'all have a good one.

I hear you, sir. Okay. Thank you for a couple of days.

Bottom of page three. Document number 21032, in the third ward. Ordinance was, oh, I'm sorry.

We wanted to move. Did we want to move?

[Speaker 11] (1:45:09 - 1:45:11)
Yes. Okay. Hold on.

[Speaker 1] (1:45:11 - 1:45:53)
We're going to, committee members, we need to just, in order to assist Ms. Castro, she will be filling in for Mike Esger. So let's go to the top of page nine. Document number 20948-T1, in the 25th ward.

Ordinance was referred on February 23rd of 2022. Common address is 1026 through 1044 West Jackson Boulevard. And the change request from the DS3, Downtown Service District, to the DX7, Downtown Mixed Use District.

And we have Jimena Castro on this item in the 25th ward. Okay. Sorry about that for a second.

[Speaker 10] (1:45:54 - 1:46:20)
It's okay. I appreciate that. For the record, my name is Jimena Castro, zoning attorney at Acosta-Esger.

And one of the attorneys for the applicant for the matter before you today, as the chairman stated, located at 1026 through 44 West Jackson Boulevard. At this time, we do have a substitute ordinance, narrative, and plans to change the proposed rezoning to a DR5 instead of a DX7.

[Speaker 1] (1:46:20 - 1:46:59)
Okay. Okay. So we have to, Vice Chair Roboius moves to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

And this substitute is moving from a DX7 to a DX5? DR5. DR5.

Okay. So that's the motion. Any objections to that motion?

Hearing none, the substitute is before us. And now we have an issue with the Type 1, correct?

[Speaker 10] (1:47:00 - 1:47:21)
Correct. So we are substituting. We work with the aldermen, the community, and Patrick Murphy to change the initial request from a DX7 to a DR5, which is why the change, why we're doing the substitute ordinance, narrative, and plans.

[Speaker 1] (1:47:21 - 1:47:26)
Okay. So it's, okay. Basically the same problem we're correcting.

[Speaker 10] (1:47:26 - 1:47:27)
Correct.

[Speaker 1] (1:47:27 - 1:47:48)
All right. So Alderman Roboius moves to accept the substantive narrative and plans for the Type 1 application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that being the same issue?

All right. Hearing none, the substantive narrative and plans are accepted. And the down zoning is in place.

And let's talk about the project.

[Speaker 10] (1:47:48 - 1:48:56)
Okay. Thank you. So the subject property is currently approved with a one and two-story commercial and manufacturing buildings and parking lot.

The applicant proposes to redone the property from a DS3 to a DR5 to construct a new 11-story building containing 54 residential dwelling units, 108 automobile parking spaces, 50 bicycle parking spaces, and one loading berth. The proposed building height is 129 feet and 11 inches. And we met with the alderman on this matter, went through his community process for several months.

And we have been working as well with Patrick Murphy and DPD to come up with a favorable zoning district for this particular area. And in addition, I would like to add that we are doing the required affordable offsite and are working in conjunction with the alderman's office to make sure that all of that is addressed and successfully executed.

[Speaker 1] (1:48:59 - 1:49:11)
Thank you. Alderman Sicil Lopez. Just had him on the call.

[Speaker 21] (1:49:14 - 1:49:29)
Sorry, chairman, I was muted. But yeah, also the applicant that did meet with the zoning advisory board, we had a regular community process. And I would like to ask your colleagues for a favorable consideration on this item.

[Speaker 1] (1:49:31 - 1:50:07)
Thank you, alderman. Any questions for the applicant or the alderman? All right.

Hearing none, can I get a motion to move do pass knowing that we had a substitute and also a type one narrative change with plans? So it's based on those recommendations. Can I get a motion to move to pass?

Moved to pass, Alderman Wagesbeck. Alderman Wagesbeck makes the motion. Any objections to that?

Hearing none, again, the item is passed with the substitute and the narrative and plans. All right.

[Speaker 10] (1:50:07 - 1:50:08)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (1:50:09 - 1:50:15)
Thank you. All right, now we're back to the bottom of page three.

[Speaker 8] (1:50:21 - 1:50:22)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (1:50:23 - 1:51:02)
Document number 21032 in the third ward. Ordinances for on May 23rd of 2022. Common address is 5036 through 5058 South Prairie.

Also 224 through 232 East 51st Street. The change request from an RM5, residential multi-unit district to B33 community shopping district and C23 motor vehicle related district all to a B23 neighborhood mixed-use district. We have Steve Friedland on this item in the third ward.

And we have slides, right? Okay.

[Speaker 8] (1:51:02 - 1:52:03)
Yes, and you should have a few slides. Can you hear me, Mr. Chairman? We can.

Thank you. My name is Steve Friedland with the law firm of Applegate and Thornton Thompson here on behalf of the applicant 5050 Prairie LLC. 5050 Prairie is a limited liability company owned by Carrie Young.

Carrie has developed many mixed-use projects over the last 30 years throughout the Chicago area. Before I do proceed, I would ask that the committee accept the substitute ordinance. The substitute has very minor change, but what we realized after filing is that the address on 51st Street is really 226 to 232.

224 is an existing business that's not part of our application. It didn't change our description in any way, but we wanted the address to be reflected in the ordinance. So we prepared a substitute.

[Speaker 1] (1:52:04 - 1:52:15)
Okay. All right. On the address, on the address change, does the department have that substitute?

[Speaker 22] (1:52:20 - 1:52:23)
Anna Robles here, chairman. Yes, I do. I'm aware of it.

[Speaker 1] (1:52:23 - 1:52:58)
Okay. So we're going to take a motion to accept the substitute on this by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Can I get a motion, please?

Alderman- Moved to accept that Alderman Wagesvek- Alderman Wagesvek makes the motion to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Objections to it? Hearing none, the substitute is in front of us.

And again, it's only the one address change from 224 to 226 through 232 East 51st Street. Correct, Steve?

[Speaker 8] (1:52:59 - 1:54:41)
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. You can go to the next slide just to show the property. This property is on the northeast corner of 51st and Prairie.

It's a site that's comprised of two lots that's owned by Mr. Young and three lots owned by the city of Chicago that the city is working with Mr. Young to convey. Mr. Young is proposing to redevelop the site as you see it here with a new four-story, 49-unit building with 27 parking spaces. If you go to the next slide, you'll see just a site plan which shows you how the parking is laid out along the alleyway with the building along Prairie.

The site is transit served based on its proximity to the 51st Street Greenline Station. There will be on the first floor approximately 4,400 square feet of commercial space which will be really nice for that transit serve location. I would also state that we have been working with the Department of Planning and Development on design issues because of the transfer of the land and the design that you see here is one that we've agreed to with them.

There was a community meeting held a couple of weeks ago under the auspices of Alderman Dalla. I know she's here at the meeting so she can speak to the project but we believe we have her support. There will be a five ARO, there's a requirement of five ARO units as part of the project.

Two of those will be purchased by the applicant and three will be included in the development. With that, I believe Mr. Young and our architect are on the call. If you have any questions, we'd be happy to answer them.

[Speaker 1] (1:54:42 - 1:54:47)
Thank you, Steve. Handsome building, Alderman Dalla.

[Speaker 11] (1:54:49 - 1:55:35)
Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman and to the members of the committee. I'm asking for your support for this mixed use development near transit at the 51st Street Greenline Station. This development is sorely needed to help in the effort to uplift an important commercial corridor in Bronzeville.

I'd like to thank the Department of Planning and Development, Justin Peterson for his work on this and I would like to make a correction that this building is on the Northwest corner not the Northeast corner. So with that, Mr. Chairman, I ask for the support of the committee.

[Speaker 1] (1:55:36 - 1:56:06)
Thank you, Alderman. Questions for the applicant or the Alderwoman? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move?

Do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum knowing that minor substitute on the address change. I move, Mr. Chairman, with no objection. Alderwoman Carrie Austin makes the motion.

Any objections? Hearing none, this item again is passed with the substitute.

[Speaker 11] (1:56:07 - 1:56:37)
Mr. Chairman, let me take 30 seconds just to say to Steve Valenciano how much I have truly appreciated working with him over the many years and decades actually that we've known each other. Steve, you are an absolute professional public servant. You will truly be missed and I wish you well in whatever you do next.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:56:38 - 1:57:46)
Thank you. And I know we'll have accolades with Steve before we convene or end the meeting. Just for the benefit of committee members, you do have a substitute ordinance with Alderwoman Haddon's ordinance that's been emailed to you.

Again, we'll take it up near the end of the meeting, but the substitute with the change requested hopefully meets with an approval we can get something passed today. So just FYI, try to read that while we're going through this hearing. All right, top of page four, document number 21027, 37th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on May 23rd of 2022. Common address 5202 through 5224 West Chicago Avenue, 802 through 812 North Laramie Avenue, 803 through 813 North Latrobe Avenue. Change request from B3-1 Community Shopping District to B2-3 Neighborhood Mixed Use District, and then to a plan development.

Steve Friedland again on this item in 37.

[Speaker 8] (1:57:47 - 1:58:27)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Steve Friedland with the law firm of Applegate and Thornton Thompson. Here on behalf of Austin United Alliance Development Company.

The development company is a joint venture between Oak Park Regional Housing and Heartland Housing. Inc, both of whom are longstanding not-for-profit organizations working in the area of affordable housing. Before I begin my presentation, I would note that we appeared before the plan commission on June 16th, and I would request that the committee incorporate the findings and record of the plan commission into this record.

[Speaker 1] (1:58:28 - 1:58:40)
Alderman Wagesack moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Objections to his motion? Hearing none, these records are now incorporated.

Continue, Steve.

[Speaker 8] (1:58:41 - 2:00:21)
So this property is on the north side of Chicago Avenue between Latrobe and Laramie. I should say, I thank you to Alderman Dowell for correcting me on the other one. She just made me check to make sure I'm right.

This is the north side, and I think I can write about that. It is part of the city's Invest Southwest initiative, and is a part of really a greater investment the city and Alderman Mitts are planning for the Austin community. The site is located on Chicago Avenue, so it qualifies as a transit-served location.

And there's really two distinct components to this project. The first is that the historic Laramie State Bank Building is going to be preserved and redeveloped with office and commercial uses. The other aspect of the development is that the remainder of the block, approximately three quarters of that block, will have a new six-story, 78-unit residential building with a large open courtyard along Chicago Avenue, which will activate that street.

There will also be 28 parking spaces at the site. This project is mostly affordable. It will have 51 of its 78 units as affordable, with the remaining units, 27 units being market rate.

I'd certainly be happy to discuss any other aspects of the project with the committee, and we have lots of witnesses here.

[Speaker 1] (2:00:21 - 2:00:32)
All right, I'm kind of surprised we don't have some illustrations of this.

[Speaker 8] (2:00:32 - 2:00:41)
I did send the slides, so I'm a little surprised they're not up either. I don't know if Raymond and I just had a mix up there.

[Speaker 1] (2:00:41 - 2:01:05)
Okay, well, as a member of Planning Commission, it's a pretty exciting project for the 37th Ward. And obviously, Emma Mitts, or the Alderman, was very supportive of that. So is, oh, Alderman Mitts, do you want to talk about this super exciting project in your ward?

[Speaker 24] (2:01:06 - 2:03:24)
I most certainly would. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and to the committee members. I am in full support of this project.

This is a project that I saw right now in the community. It's on one of our corridors, and that's Southwest Corridors. It sits on a main corner, but the building is a landmark building.

And to get that building back up and beautify where we put it back on the tax flow, it's going to be a great incentive to the community. As well as continuing with the Invest Southwest projects that we have already that are moving forward on the avenue. So I'm asking that if, let me just say this, I want to thank the partners who are working along the Oak Park Housing Project, the Heart and the Lions Group, and all the community members for all the meetings that we've held and engaging the community regarding the project.

Athena William, who is the Executive Director for this project, at once was an employee of mine at my ward office, a passion is housing. And I'm glad to see her moving into the direction of helping to give back to the community by creating more affordable housing. I was grateful to have our commissioner from housing to come out on a tour, as well as our chairman doing some of our meetings.

And as we were bringing, wanted them to see the work that was being done and how this building looked and can't wait until it gets started on it. So I'm looking for the favorable to us to be able to continue to take out old and bring in newness during this time. Thank you, Chairman Turney.

[Speaker 1] (2:03:25 - 2:03:33)
Congratulations, Emma. It's a super exciting project. I was lucky enough to be on plan commission to see it.

Alderman Osterman.

[Speaker 23] (2:03:35 - 2:04:01)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to commend Alderman Mitts. This development's gonna be a catalyst, not just for that corner and that block, but I think it's gonna spark development around there.

And it's only happening because of her leadership and stick-to-it-ness to make sure that it happens and benefits the residents of her community. So it's a warmer day than the day we were out there, Emma, but I just want to wish you all the best and congratulations.

[Speaker 1] (2:04:06 - 2:04:28)
Any other questions? Comments? And I want to get a motion by Alderman Osterman to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Objections to his motion? So moved, Mr. Chairman. Alderman Dowell.

Alderman Dowell also. Any objections? Hearing none, this item is passed as revised.

[Speaker 24] (2:04:29 - 2:04:29)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (2:04:30 - 2:04:32)
Congrats, Emma. Amazing.

[Speaker 24] (2:04:33 - 2:04:37)
Thank you. Thanks, everyone. Middle of page four.

[Speaker 1] (2:04:38 - 2:05:00)
Document number 21029, 12th Ward. Ordinance was referred to May 23rd of 2022. Common address 2538 South Troy Street and the change request.

From a C12 neighborhood commercial district to an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district. We have Tyler Manick in the 12th Ward application. Tyler.

[Speaker 9] (2:05:01 - 2:06:13)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Tyler Manick of Shane Banks, Kenyon-Schwartz. I'm here on behalf of LV2538 Troy LLC, which owns a property subject to the zoning map amendment request at 2538 South Troy.

The property is a two-story, 100-year-old commercial building. Over the years, the block has become predominantly residential, leaving this commercial use impractical and out of character and without a good use. As a result, the applicant seeks to rezone this parcel from a C12 neighborhood commercial district to an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse district in order to allow the applicant to convert the building into a residential use and activate it.

The applicant intends to preserve the building so that this application merely implicates a change of use, which is consistent with this block. The applicant has met with Alderman Cardenas, who has given us a letter of support for this application. Accordingly, I respectfully request this committee's favorable recommendation to pass a zoning map amendment of 2538 South Troy to change the zoning from a C12 zoning district to an RT4 zoning district, and I'd be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (2:06:14 - 2:07:04)
Thank you, Tyler. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Cardenas. Questions for Mr. Manick or the Alderman?

Hearing none, can I get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? That is Alderman Cardenas makes the motion. Any objections to his motion?

Hearing none, the item is passed. Moving on, bottom of page four, document number 21038T1, 27th Ward. Ordinances refer to May 23rd of 2022, common address 215 North Green Street, and the change request from a DX3 Downtown Mixed Use District to a DX3 Downtown Mixed Use District.

That was slightly amended. Tyler Manick, would you like to discuss this?

[Speaker 9] (2:07:05 - 2:09:21)
Yes, thank you again, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. Again, for the record, my name is Tyler Manick of Shane Banks Kensington Shores, and I'm the attorney for 215 North Green LLC, which owns a property at 215 North Green. 215 North Green is currently improved with a three-story mixed use building with ground floor commercial space and a dwelling unit on the second to third floors.

The current structure is plagued by a number of functional and structural deficiencies, such as a recessed commercial space, creating gaps in the street front and security risks, as well as cinder block construction. The applicant was before this committee for a zoning map amendment in October, 2021, and obtained that zoning map amendment from a C11 to a DX3 to correct these flaws in the building. The 2021 zoning map amendment allowed the applicant to expand the existing building by adding two stories, a second dwelling unit, and allow for two stories of commercial space and with three stories of residential.

However, in the course of permitting, the applicant structural engineer determined that the soil conditions were insufficient to hold this proposed expansion that was contemplated in the 2021 zoning map amendment. As a result, the applicant is here today before this committee to amend the 2021 zoning map amendment by substituting new plans on a scaled down level to address the poor soil conditions at this location. These plans would maintain the existing building, albeit with minor changes that still address the problems plaguing the building, such as bringing the commercial space to the street front, preserve the integrity of that corridor, as well as address the cinder block construction.

As before the applicant engaged the local community groups and met with West Central Association, neighbors of West Loop and West Loop Community Organization prior to filing this application to discuss these scaled down plans. And each of these organizations reconfirmed their support for this project. Based on my conversation with Alderman Burnett, I believe he is also present to express his support for this project.

[Speaker 1] (2:09:23 - 2:09:25)
Thank you, Tyler. Let's hear from Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 6] (2:09:27 - 2:10:10)
Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. As the councilor said, he brought it to my attention.

It's not a major rezoning to build a brand new big development. So I just suggested that he go see the local community organizations to see if they will allow for the minor adjustment. He went to all three of the local community organizations, the West Loop Gate, West Central, and now, and they don't have any problem with the minor adjustment.

So they supported, I supported, we asked for the committee support. It's not too often we get a building that's going to be smaller than what it initially was proposed for. So we look forward to it and we ask for the committee support.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:10:10 - 2:10:55)
Thank you, Alderman. Questions for the applicant or the Alderman? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move, do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

So moved, Alderman Haddon. Alderman Haddon makes the motion. Any objections to her motion?

Hearing none, this item is passed. All right, top of page five, document number 21028, 47th Ward. Ordinance was referred to May 23rd of 2022.

Common address is 4649 North Damon Avenue. And the change request from an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to a B3 1.5 community shopping district. Again, we have Tyler Manick in the item in the 47th Ward.

[Speaker 9] (2:10:56 - 2:12:16)
Thank you again, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Tyler Manick. I'm here on behalf of the applicant Chervelle Properties LLC, which owns the property at 4649 North Damon.

The property is currently approved with a two-story mixed use building. In the general city-wide zoning map change about 17 years ago, this property was rezoned from a B4-2 to an RS3 zoning district. After the restaurant that was occupying the ground floor space went out of business during COVID, the current RS3 zoning district prevented the applicant from activating this commercial space.

Although it sits directly adjacent to the Damon-Brownline CTA stop, it sits in the middle of a commercial corridor. This zoning map amendment seeks to restore the property's B3 zoning district, consistent with the zoning districts of most of the properties nearby on Damon, as well as preserve the building and preserve the historical commercial use on the ground floor. Prior to filing this application, the applicant met with all the zoning advisory council, the Lincoln Square Chamber of Commerce and the Greater Ravenswood Chamber of Commerce.

And through these meetings, Alderman's kindly given the applicant a letter of support, which this committee should have on file.

[Speaker 1] (2:12:17 - 2:12:19)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Martin.

[Speaker 9] (2:12:21 - 2:12:36)
Accordingly, the applicant respectfully requests this committee's favorable recommendation for the passage to rezone 4649 North Damon from an RS3 to a B3-1.5 zoning district. I'd be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (2:12:37 - 2:12:47)
Questions said we have a letter of support from Alderman Martin. No hands up. Can I get a motion to move do pass for the same roll call that was used in the term of quorum?

[Speaker 12] (2:12:48 - 2:12:50)
Move to pass term and Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (2:12:50 - 2:13:11)
Alderman is back on the motion. Any objections? Hearing on the items passed.

All right, middle of page five, document number 21042 T1 in the 24th ward ordinance was referred on May 23rd of 2022. The common address 3601 West Harrison Street.

[Speaker 16] (2:13:11 - 2:13:13)
Hey Tom, I got you those three things.

[Speaker 1] (2:13:16 - 2:13:31)
All right. Let me repeat the address 3601 West Harrison Street and the change request. M13 limited manufacturing business park district to C13 neighborhood commercial district.

Tim Barton.

[Speaker 15] (2:13:33 - 2:15:31)
Thank you. Thank you Alderman. Good afternoon, Chairman Tunney and members of the committee.

For the record, my name is Tim Barton. I'm an attorney with the law firm of Thomas Raines, attorney at law LLC. I am representing the applicant here, the property owner MLOOK LLC 3600 West Harrison.

The property is currently improved with a two-story approximately 120 year old mixed use building. And it's currently used for office space on the ground floor and office storage above. To the West or immediately adjacent to the property on the West, the block has zoned M1-3 and has an unimproved parking area with it.

On the South, the property is residential and is zoned RT4. On the North, the property is just South of the Eisenhower Expressway. This would be a type one rezoning.

The site plan and drawings have been included with the ordinance. The applicant is seeking to convert the second floor to a dwelling unit for that reason, is seeking the change from the current M1-3 zoning to the C1-3 neighborhood commercial district. There won't be any change to the ground floor activity nor to the building's exterior.

The applicant met with the former alderman, Alderman Scott of the 24th board who indicated his support for this. Thank you for your consideration. We're prepared to answer the committee's questions.

Okay, go ahead Eddie.

[Speaker 1] (2:15:32 - 2:16:32)
Thank you, Tim. And I did have a conversation yesterday with former Alderman Scott, Michael Scott, I should say. And he voiced his support for this and urges us to pass this ordinance today.

Questions, comments from committee members? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderman Cardona makes the motion.

Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the item is passed. Thank you, Tim.

Thank you. Bottom of page five, document number 21039 in the 38th ward. Ordinance was referred on May 23rd of 2022.

Common address 5824 West Montrose Avenue and the change request from an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RM4.5 residential multi-unit district. Tim Barton in the 38th ward. Tim.

[Speaker 15] (2:16:32 - 2:17:56)
Thank you. Good morning or good afternoon, Chairman Tunney and members of the committee. Again, for the record, my name is Tim Barton.

I'm an attorney with Thomas Hartrain's law office. I am representing the applicant here who is sick to LLC. The property is at the Northwest corner, Northeast corner, sorry, of Montrose and North Monitor Avenue.

It's improved with a three-story multi-unit residential building. The neighboring properties are actually, they're similar structures to the East and West along Montrose Avenue. There are single family homes on Monitor itself.

The applicant is seeking to convert the existing five-unit building to a six-unit building. And for that reason is seeking the change in the current zoning from its RS3 single unit detached district to an RM4 multi-unit district. Again, there won't be any change to the building's exterior on this.

The applicant has spoken with Alderman Sposato, whose letter has been submitted to the committee. And if you have any questions, I'm here to answer them.

[Speaker 1] (2:17:57 - 2:18:18)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Sposato. And I'm assuming this is not an ADU area, right? Nope.

Okay. All right. Questions, comments?

Hearing none, can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Ms. Alderman Wagesvek makes the motion.

[Speaker 18] (2:18:19 - 2:18:20)
Yes, so moved chairman, thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:18:20 - 2:18:36)
Any objections to that? Hearing none, the item is passed. All right, top of page six.

Document number 21040-T1 in the 25th ward. Ordinance was referred on May 23rd.

[Speaker 27] (2:18:36 - 2:18:38)
Somebody put it on my desk, I thought it was you.

[Speaker 1] (2:18:40 - 2:18:58)
This ordinance was referred on May 23rd of 2022. Common address 931 West 19th Street. Change request from M12 Limited Manufacturing Business Park District to a C35 Commercial Manufacturing and Employment District.

Katrina McGuire.

[Speaker 22] (2:18:59 - 2:19:43)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. Katrina McGuire from Thompson-Coburn with offices at 55 East Monroe Street. Here on behalf of the applicant and property owner, Muriel Park LLC.

We are here seeking to rezone the property, essentially to expand the permitted uses from what would be permitted under the M12 all within the existing structure that exists there today. The specific ask is to increase the restaurant, to allow a restaurant use over 4,000 square feet to be operated in conjunction with a microbrewery on the site. We also have a letter of support from Alderman Cito Lopez.

The applicant and the proposed operator did appear before the Ward Zoning Advisory Committee and did receive their support for this.

[Speaker 1] (2:19:47 - 2:19:53)
All right. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Cito Lopez, but I think he might still be on the call.

[Speaker 21] (2:19:55 - 2:20:53)
Yes, Chairman. Good afternoon. Thank you.

And this is an item that is being on the making for a little bit of time. We are glad to be able to reach an agreement with the residents. There was at least two community meetings that we hosted, making sure that we address some of the concerns, hours of operations.

But it's good to have a consensus among some of the residents, adding or having the ability to have food on the site, help us address some of the concerns of the residents who were not so much for a brewery on the site, but they really welcome this local business in the community. We hosted at least two meetings where we now were able to reach consensus on hours of operation and other concerns. So I'm glad to see a small business in our community be able to operate.

And I'm asking, of course, our colleagues for a favorable vote on this item. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:20:54 - 2:21:00)
Thank you, Alderman. And with the C5, is that about the parking, minimize the parking?

[Speaker 22] (2:21:01 - 2:21:13)
Yeah, with that also, yeah, that will give us some flexibility. And it's honestly, the size of the building is such that we're essentially trying to bring it into conformity from the existing structure as well.

[Speaker 1] (2:21:15 - 2:21:23)
All righty, questions, comments from committee members? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 8] (2:21:24 - 2:21:25)
Moved to pass, Chairman. Alderman Wagesbeck.

[Speaker 1] (2:21:25 - 2:22:00)
Alderman Wagesbeck makes the motion. Any objections to the motion? Hearing none, item is passed.

Thank you, Katrina. Moving to the middle of page six, document number 21033, T1, 32nd Ward, ordinance was referred on May 23rd of 2022, common address 1741 through 1749 North Damon Avenue, and the change request from an M12 limited manufacturing business park district to a B12 neighborhood shopping district. Sarah Barnes.

[Speaker 13] (2:22:00 - 2:24:11)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Sarah Barnes, and I'm an attorney with the Lofts. This is Sam Banks here in Chicago.

Happy to be here this afternoon on behalf of the applicant, Kensington Bucktown Building, LLC, which is actually a family-owned local daycare facility. They have several different operations throughout Chicago, the Chicagoland area. This will be their fourth location here in the city of Chicago.

As a little bit of an interesting procedural matter, the proposal calls for the construction of a new three-story daycare facility that will offer early education for children and care for children between the ages of six weeks and five years old. What makes this a little bit unique is that prior to the recent ratification of the air quality ordinance, daycare facilities were actually a permitted use under the current underlying M-1-2 zoning classification. However, in light of the air quality ordinance, it is now no longer allowed under the zoning.

So that is, we are simply here today really trying to bring the use into compliance with the current zoning ordinance and make it more compatible with the other uses along the stretch of Damon Avenue. Towards these ends, we have been working with Alderman Wagstack and his staff. As well, we have presented the proposal to the Vicar Park Committee and the Bucktown Community Organization, both of which had full membership meetings wherein they voted to support the proposal.

And I believe there is a letter of non-opposition from Alderman Wagstack in your file, Mr. Chairman, but Alderman Wagstack is still with us here today. So perhaps he would like to speak to this effect as well. Great.

[Speaker 18] (2:24:11 - 2:24:27)
All right, Alderman Wagstack. Thanks, Chairman. Sarah's correct.

We did get strong community support for it. We're taking out some old buildings here. That was an old repair shop, pretty defunct and putting in a well-needed daycare there.

[Speaker 12] (2:24:27 - 2:24:33)
So the building was well-received by the community and I would just ask the committee's favorable support of the item.

[Speaker 1] (2:24:34 - 2:25:25)
Thank you, Scott. Questions for the Alderman or the applicant? Hearing none.

Can I get a motion to move? Do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Alderman Cardona makes the motion.

Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the item is passed. Now we're in the bottom of page six.

Document number 21000, 47th Ward. Ordinance was deferred on April 27th of 2022. Common address is 4333 Northwestern Avenue.

And the change request from a B3-2 Community Shopping District to a B2-3 Neighborhood Mixed Use District. Sarah Barnes again in 47. Sarah, you need to speak up.

[Speaker 13] (2:25:25 - 2:25:26)
Sorry.

[Speaker 1] (2:25:27 - 2:25:29)
Okay, there you go. Start over again, please.

[Speaker 13] (2:25:30 - 2:26:56)
Good afternoon for the last time here today, Mr. Chairman. And esteemed members of the committee. For the record, my name is Sarah Barnes.

And I'm an attorney with the Law Offices of Sam Banks. I'm happy to be here on behalf of the applicants, Nikola Stelic and his wife, Ivana Zunich, who own the subject property. And they actually reside in the immediately adjacent building.

As well, they have offices in this neighborhood. So they are very vested members in the community, which makes this a meaningful project for us. The proposal calls for the reactivation of this now-vacant site with a new four-story, four-dwelling unit, all-residential building that will be more compatible with the pattern of recent developments in this part of the neighborhood.

Towards those ends, we have met with Alderman Martin, as well as with his 47th Ward Zoning Advisory Committee. And two, we have presented the plans to the North Center Chamber of Commerce, as well as the North Center Neighborhood Association, all of which such parties and organizations have garnered their support for the proposal. With that, I believe that Alderman Martin's office tendered to Mr. Chairman, to your office this morning, a letter of their acknowledging their support.

[Speaker 1] (2:26:57 - 2:27:24)
So with no- We do have a letter of support from Alderman Martin. And any questions from committee members? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

So moved by Alderman Cardona. Alderman Cardona makes the motion. Any objections to the motion?

Hearing none, this item is passed. Thank you, Sarah. Have a good day.

[Speaker 13] (2:27:24 - 2:27:25)
Have a great day. Bye.

[Speaker 1] (2:27:26 - 2:28:04)
All right, top of page seven. Document number 21030 in the 33rd Ward. Ordinance was referred on May 23rd of 2022.

Common address, 4200 North Sacramento Avenue. And the change request from an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RM4.5 residential multi-unit district. Matt Alley.

Matt Alley.

[Speaker 18] (2:28:04 - 2:30:14)
Yes, I'm here. Thank you, Chairman. Good afternoon, Chairman.

Didn't I recognize you from somewhere? Indeed. On the other side.

All right, proceed. Thank you, Alderman. Good afternoon, Chairman Tony and members of the committee.

For the record, Matthew Alley, an attorney with the law firm of Shane Banks, Kenyon Schwartz. On behalf of the applicant, Chris Kaplan. Mr. Kaplan owns the property located at 4200 North Sacramento Avenue. A parcel that has been owned by his family for over 50 years and which has a current zoning designation of RS3. The subject property contains a two-story building with three dwelling units and a long vacant ground floor commercial space. Historically, Mr. Kaplan's family operated a grocery store in this space, but due to urban planning shifts in the neighborhood, including a subsequent change in the broader neighborhood zoning designation to the current RS3, the store became no longer viable and ceased operations over 20 years ago. Mr. Kaplan and his family have tried for years to lease out the commercial space, but without success. As such, the commercial usage of the ground floor space has since lost its nonconforming status. In fact, even if the commercial tenant wanted to move into the space today, we would need a zoning change in order to reestablish the commercial usage.

However, given the lack of commercial viability, the applicant instead seeks to retain the historical structure and activate the vacant commercial space by converting it into a fourth dwelling unit. Here too, given the minimum lot area per dwelling unit standard, the property requires the requested zoning change to an RM4.5 zoning designation to allow for this conversion. Prior to filing this application, we worked closely with Alderman Rosano Rodriguez-Sanchez to ensure this zoning change is appropriate for our community.

We submitted the alderman's detailed intake form, which was posted on our website for community review. The project was also shared with the community groups and members most impacted by this request, all of which resulted in no concerns being raised. As such, we have a letter of support from the alderman, which was submitted to the committee for consideration, and we thank the alderman for her review and support.

We now request this committee's favorable consideration and would welcome any questions or comments from committee members.

[Speaker 1] (2:30:15 - 2:30:27)
Thank you, Matt. We have a letter of support from Alderman Rodriguez-Sanchez. Just a quick question.

You have four dwelling units. Is there any parking or not?

[Speaker 18] (2:30:28 - 2:30:40)
There are two existing parking spaces because we are adding only a single unit, and due to the age of the structure, the additional one dwelling unit did not trigger the need for an additional off-street parking space.

[Speaker 1] (2:30:41 - 2:31:33)
All right. Again, we do have a letter of support from Alderman Rodriguez-Sanchez. Any questions, comments?

Hearing none, can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call as used to determine quorum? So moved by Alderman Cardona. Alderman Cardona makes the motion.

Objections to his motion? Hearing none, the item is passed. Now we're in the middle of page seven, document number 21031 in the 34th Ward.

Ordinance was referred to May 23rd of 2022. Common address 1956 and 1957 West 115th Street. Change request from an RS3 residential single unit detached house district and a B31 community shopping district all to a T transportation district.

Carol Stubblefield. Carol?

[Speaker 26] (2:31:34 - 2:32:15)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. Carol Stubblefield with Neal and Roy, offices at 20 South Clark. Here today on behalf of the applicant, Metro Commuter Rail Division of the Regional Transportation.

Mr. Chairman, Metro seeks a rezoning of the property to a T district to renovate the 115th Street and Morgan Park Station on the Metro Electric District line. The applicant has complied with all notice requirements and has received the support rather of Alderwoman Austin. I believe Alderwoman Austin is on the call today, but we have submitted a letter of support for the file.

There are no known objectors for the project or the rezoning and we ask for favorable approval of this rezoning request.

[Speaker 1] (2:32:16 - 2:32:24)
Thank you. Thank you, Carol. Alderwoman Austin, are you on the call?

Yes, I'm still here. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 14] (2:32:24 - 2:32:58)
Yes, I'm in full support of renovation of this station, but I have to ask Metro, when will they get to the one that's on South Halston? Because that one haven't been attended to at all. All you do is put gravel down.

So, and I know that we've been requesting an update of the station. We still haven't gotten any support from them. So, even though we're approving this, because this is a necessity, we also need to put improvements at the one on South Halston.

[Speaker 1] (2:32:59 - 2:33:23)
Thank you, Alderwoman. So, would you like the committee to hold this until you get an answer from? No, that won't be necessary.

I know how to ride them. I know you do, my dear. Okay.

All right. Questions for the Alderwoman or Ms. Stubblefield? Hearing none, I need a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

[Speaker 18] (2:33:24 - 2:33:26)
I'll move Chairman Alderman Wagesbeck.

[Speaker 1] (2:33:27 - 2:33:41)
Alderman Wagesbeck makes the motion. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Did you get that Ms. Stubblefield? Are you gonna make sure? We don't wanna upset the Chairwoman Austin.

[Speaker 30] (2:33:42 - 2:33:45)
I understand and I will carry that message back to my client.

[Speaker 1] (2:33:46 - 2:34:25)
All right. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Bottom of page seven, document number 21034, in the 42nd Ward, ordinances referred to May 23rd of 2022, common address 151 through 183 North Michigan Avenue and the change request from residential business plan development number 186 as amended to DX 16 downtown mixed use district. And we have Taylor Talar Barbarian. I hope I got that right.

Barbarian. All right. Sorry about that.

Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman. I am sorry about that.

[Speaker 22] (2:34:25 - 2:34:27)
So I won't make that big of a problem at all.

[Speaker 1] (2:34:27 - 2:34:30)
All right. Continue on this item on Michigan Avenue, please.

[Speaker 22] (2:34:31 - 2:36:00)
Yes. So I am here on behalf of the applicant, Christine LLC. I'm with a law firm of Thompson Coburn located at 55 East Monroe.

And this request has been vetted through the Alderman's office. We worked with them as well as with the Department of Planning and Development to sort of conceive of this plan to take the existing plan development out of its PD designation and rezone it to the DX 16 district. That will allow us to subsequently apply for an administrative adjustment under section 17-4-1008 of the zoning ordinance, which will permit existing FAR to become legal or legal conformity under the DX 16 district.

And it will permit the addition of up to 5% of additional FAR. The current request for the rezoning will not permit any additional construction on the site. But the intent is thereafter once, if the administrative adjustment is approved, there will be a three-story addition proposed at the corner of Michigan and Randolph, which is currently underdeveloped.

Okay, we do have a letter of support from the Alderman, which was delivered to the committee yesterday.

[Speaker 1] (2:36:01 - 2:36:07)
So we do have letters of support from Alderman Riley. Is Alderman Riley on the call still?

[Speaker 23] (2:36:08 - 2:36:09)
Yeah, I'm here chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:36:09 - 2:36:13)
All right, you wanna comment on 151 North Michigan, please?

[Speaker 7] (2:36:14 - 2:36:38)
Sure, I think council properly stated it. This is by neighborhood context, not a major development, but a small retail addition to an existing property. It'll certainly take the underutilized site to a higher and better use.

And for those reasons, I support it. And I appreciate your support as well, chairman and colleagues. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:36:38 - 2:37:34)
Thank you, Alderman. Any questions for the Alderman or the applicant? Hearing none, Alderman Waguespack makes a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Objections to his motion? Hearing none, the item is passed. All right, top of page eight, document number 20867 in the second ward ordinance was referred on November 17th of 21.

Common address is 1967 North Kingsbury. And the change request from B31 Community Shopping District, then to plan business plan development number 646 as amended. This is Katie Janky Dale in the second ward.

[Speaker 19] (2:37:35 - 2:38:00)
Thank you. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Katie Janky Dale from the law firm of DLA Piper.

And along with my colleague, Rich Clowder, we represent the applicant for this matter, Alloy Property Company to LLC. As a preliminary matter, this application was considered and recommended for approval at the June 16th, 2022 plan commission hearing. We would request that the transcript from that hearing be incorporated into the record today.

[Speaker 1] (2:38:01 - 2:38:13)
Alderman Waguespack moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that? Hearing none, the records are incorporated.

So continue.

[Speaker 19] (2:38:13 - 2:38:52)
Thank you. Advance to the next slide. This property is located at the northeast corner of Cortland and Kingsbury.

It's currently zoned PD-646, which was originally approved in 1997. The applicant is requesting rezoning to amend the PD to allow for a single story drive-through facility with five parking spaces. And the building itself is shown on the next slide.

Our project team worked very closely with Alderman Hopkins' office, the community, DPD, and CDOT on this project and made significant changes to the site plan and traffic circulation as a result. I'm available for any questions, but thank you for your time and consideration.

[Speaker 1] (2:38:56 - 2:39:11)
Thank you. Do we, what do we have? This is, well, I was a member of plan commission.

I made my comments there. We do, we have the support of Alderman Hopkins. Is Brian on the call?

[Speaker 2] (2:39:12 - 2:39:12)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (2:39:13 - 2:39:15)
Do you want to comment on this one, Brian?

[Speaker 2] (2:39:15 - 2:40:23)
Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Briefly, as Ms. Jankudale said, the project went through a number of revisions after input from the neighborhood. We also would like to thank the CDOT traffic engineers.

They were instrumental working with the private consultant on really testing the model for the drive-through traffic flow. And those tests did result in a number of changes, which we think will make this a much more efficient operation. We think it's going to be successful.

And frankly, we want it to be successful. But when you have success with the drive-in donut window, that can have a negative impact on surrounding traffic. So every effort was made to make sure that the traffic configuration during peak hours, particularly in the morning when people are lining up to get coffee and donuts, it's not going to spill over onto Clybourne and cause additional backup there.

A lot of work and a lot of thought went into this. We have full support from the Neighborhood Association of record as a result. They were partners throughout this process.

We're very excited. This is going to be a nice addition to the neighborhood. And we look forward to the groundbreaking.

I urge an aye vote.

[Speaker 1] (2:40:25 - 2:40:35)
All right. Thank you, Alderman. Any questions for the applicant or the alderwoman?

It did pass successfully at the Planning Commission, obviously.

[Speaker 27] (2:40:36 - 2:40:38)
Move to pass, Chairman, if there's no questions.

[Speaker 1] (2:40:38 - 2:41:23)
All right. So Alderman Wagesvek makes a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none. This item is passed as revised. Thank you.

All right. Now we're on the middle of page eight. Document number 20868 in the 27th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on November 17th of 21. Common address is 210 through 220 North Morgan Street. And the change request from C11 Neighborhood Commercial District to DX7 Downtown Mixed Use District and then to a residential business plan development.

Again, Katie Jenke-Dale on this application in 27th Ward.

[Speaker 19] (2:41:24 - 2:41:49)
Thank you. Again, for the record, Katie Jenke-Dale from the Law Firm of DLA Paper. And along with my colleague, Rich Plowder, we represent an applicant for this matter, Solar Junkyard LLC, which is an affiliate of Chicago-based Newcastle Limited.

Again, as a preliminary matter, this application was considered and recommended for approval at the May 19th, 2022 Planning Commission hearing. And we would request that the transcript from that hearing be incorporated into the record today.

[Speaker 1] (2:41:51 - 2:42:03)
Alderman Cardona moves to incorporate the records with the Planning Commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Objections to that? Hearing none, the records are incorporated.

Would you continue, Katie?

[Speaker 19] (2:42:05 - 2:43:01)
Next slide, please. This site is located on the west side of Morgan, mid-block between Lake and Fulton. We're requesting a rezoning from the current C11 to the DX7 District then to a residential business plan development to allow the construction of a 30-story building with up to 204 dwelling units and a minimum of 50 parking spaces.

The building itself is shown on the next slide. The applicant will be providing all 20% of the required affordable units on-site and making a payment of over $1.8 million into the Neighborhood Opportunity Bonus Fund. The project team presented this project to the Committee on Design and worked closely with Alderman Burnett, Wilco, WCA, and Nowell, as well as DPD staff on the design.

We would like to thank them for their time and work with us on this. Please let me know if you have any questions. Otherwise, we respectfully request the committee's favorable recommendation.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:43:02 - 2:43:03)
Thank you, Katie. Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 6] (2:43:09 - 2:43:25)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Katie, a couple of questions. If you don't mind, Mr. Chairman. One, is it DLA Piper or DLF Piper? What's the name of your company? DLA Piper.

So all this time, I've been saying Piper, man.

[Speaker 19] (2:43:25 - 2:43:26)
Piper is right.

[Speaker 6] (2:43:27 - 2:43:27)
It's Piper?

[Speaker 19] (2:43:28 - 2:43:28)
Yes.

[Speaker 6] (2:43:28 - 2:43:32)
Okay. And this is not Sterling Bay's building?

[Speaker 19] (2:43:33 - 2:43:34)
Nope, this one's Newcastle.

[Speaker 6] (2:43:35 - 2:43:39)
Oh, this is the Newcastle. Okay, right there on the other side of Lake Street.

[Speaker 19] (2:43:40 - 2:43:43)
Yeah. Sterling Bay, you can actually see on the left-hand side here.

[Speaker 6] (2:43:43 - 2:43:47)
What about the other 10% affordable housing?

[Speaker 19] (2:43:48 - 2:44:08)
We've already met with the Department of Housing and had the intake meeting with them to try to see. We have the same language in this plan development about working with them to get that extra 10%. We've had our initial meeting with them, provided them with documents.

We're waiting for feedback from housing right now, but we've already started that process to try to work with them to get there.

[Speaker 6] (2:44:10 - 2:46:40)
So you're working with them on the 10%? Correct. Okay.

All right. So, Mr. Chairman, and I know we saw this in the Department at the Plan Commission. And as the counselor said, they did meet with all of the local community organizations.

We did have a community meeting. We didn't have any objections. We encouraged them to meet with the adjacent neighbors to the property, and they were able to accommodate them with any issues that they may have.

This developer, his contractor is going to joint venture with a minority contractor to fill the 30% and also hire people from the community. If I'm not mistaken, and Katie didn't mention this, but this development being right along the Morgan Street L station has a substantial amount of... They're going to even have public bike parking in this building, if I'm not mistaken, which is an amenity to the community to keep cars off the street.

Which we think is something that's unique and good. And also, over here on this side of Lake Street, we try to encourage 30% affordable housing is not by law, but we encourage them to move in that direction, along with getting some type of subsidy from the city in order to be able to do it. So they've been working with the Department of Planning, the Department of Housing on it.

It will be 20% affordable housing, definitely. And they're working in line on dealing with the 30%. Between now and the council meeting, I guess we're meeting tomorrow, is it?

That I'm going to be talking with the Department of Housing and Planning to see where they are with that. So I have no challenge with this outside of trying to encourage them to do a little more with the affordable housing, like everyone else. But other than that, I think this is a great project.

I was pleasantly surprised that the community didn't have any objections. I also appreciate the fact that the Department of Planning encouraged them to make several adjustments to their masking, and they adhere to those things. And that's why this building is as unique as it does.

So with that, I ask for the committee's support.

[Speaker 1] (2:46:40 - 2:47:42)
Thank you. Thank you, Alderman. Questions for the applicant or the Alderman?

Hearing none, can I get a motion to move do pass for the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderman Cardona makes the motion. Any objections to his motion?

Hearing no objections, this item is passed as revised. Thank you. All right.

Bottom of page eight, document number 20961. In the 10th ward, ordinance was referred on March 23rd of 22. Common address is 3211-3227 East 92nd Street.

Also 9200-9242 South Burley Avenue. And the change request from B-2-2 neighborhood mixed use district and RS-2 residential single unit detached house district, all to a residential business plan development. And we have Andrew Scott on this item in the 10th ward.

[Speaker 28] (2:47:44 - 2:48:14)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. For the record, my name is Andrew Scott with the law office of Dykema Gossett. And I'm here on behalf of Sacred Apartment Developers, LLC, and they are actually, it's a joint venture between Clarition Associates and Interfaith Housing Development Corporation.

And Mr. Chairman, if I might, before we move on, this matter was before the plan commission last Thursday, June 16th, received unanimous recommendation. But I would ask that we incorporate the record and proceeding from that meeting into the record here today.

[Speaker 18] (2:48:19 - 2:48:23)
Chairman, I move to incorporate into the record, if that's applicable.

[Speaker 1] (2:48:25 - 2:48:37)
Alderman Wagesvac moves to incorporate the records of the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Objections to that? Hearing none, the records are incorporated.

Continue, please. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 28] (2:48:38 - 2:49:23)
This is the redevelopment of a largely one acre plus site down at the corner of 92nd and Burleigh in the 10th ward. The proposed project will include 81 affordable units. All of the units are gonna be affordable here.

They range across different AMIs, sizes from studios to one bedrooms, three bedrooms and four bedrooms. There are also gonna be 44 parking spaces as well as approximately 6,000 square feet of retail. My client is actually working with a grocer to take that space to sort of fill one of the gaps in the food desert down in the 10th ward.

So that'll definitely be amenity to the community. And we would appreciate the committee's favorable recommendations. I can answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (2:49:26 - 2:49:52)
All right, we have a letter of support from Alderman Szybowski-Garza. It's obviously a handsome project that met with a lot of support from the plan commission. If not unanimous, I believe.

Questions? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderman?

[Speaker 8] (2:49:52 - 2:49:54)
Moved to pass, Chairman Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (2:49:54 - 2:50:01)
August Beck makes that motion. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, this item is passed as revised.

[Speaker 28] (2:50:01 - 2:50:03)
Thank you very much. Have a good afternoon, everyone.

[Speaker 1] (2:50:04 - 2:50:28)
All right, now we're in the middle of page nine. Document number 20864 in the 27th ward. The ordinance was deferred on October 14th of 21.

Common address is 512 through 528 South California Avenue. And the change request from B23 Neighborhood Mixed Use District to C11 Neighborhood Commercial District. Nick Fatikas.

[Speaker 7] (2:50:31 - 2:50:41)
Thank you, Chairman. Nick Fatikas from the Law Offices of Sam Banks for the record. I'm here on behalf of the applicant and property owner, Northern Astori Property Management, LLC.

[Speaker 2] (2:50:42 - 2:50:52)
As you stated, Chairman, the zoning change request is from the existing B2-3 zoning district to a C1-1 zoning district.

[Speaker 7] (2:50:52 - 2:51:18)
The zoning change would allow the applicant to develop the property with a new gas station, accessory retail convenience store, and a single lane automatic car wash facility. We have worked extensively with Alderman Burnett on this proposal. We actually participated in two different community meetings and obtained a handful of letters of support from immediate neighbors.

I believe the Alderman's on the call as well.

[Speaker 6] (2:51:19 - 2:53:23)
To confirm support. And I'll yield the floor to him at this point. Okay, Alderman Burnett, please.

Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. Mr. Chairman, this is a proposed development at a site that has been vacant for over 20 years. An area where we're doing some affordable housing development, right?

Almost adjacent to it on the same block. We did have a community meeting over Zoom during COVID. And there was still some questions to be answered and asked in reference to that meeting.

And I really wanted to get more of a feel of the people and make sure that the people understood what they were looking at. So we had an in-person meeting. So we had another in-person meeting in my office.

Of course, this is one of these situations where we had a competing property owner that wanted to do the same thing, but didn't have the, I guess, the resources to do it. So he's trying to block this guy. So I was in the middle of a sort of a debate.

And I wanted to make sure that the adjacent neighbors in my ward who was concerned about the property was okay with it. And we did have a meeting and everyone was okay with it. Thought that this would be an enhancement to the property, bring some job opportunities and some amenities to this community.

So I asked for the committee support. But just want you all to, just for the record, just want to put it all out there because we did have several meetings and there were several other people involved. And I want to make sure on the record that it's known that we tried to do everything we can to involve and inform everyone of everything.

So, and I didn't have any objections at the meeting.

[Speaker 1] (2:53:23 - 2:53:40)
All right, questions for the applicant or the alderman? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? So moved by Alderman Cardona.

Alderman Cardona makes the motion. Any objections to the motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

[Speaker 6] (2:53:41 - 2:53:43)
Thank you, sir. Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (2:53:43 - 2:55:06)
All right, so now we're on the bottom of page nine and my staff has brought me up to date on this item. Recall, we're going to recall this document 02021-5717 for the file number known as 20890 for the address commonly noted as 5435 North Walcott. The item was heard and passed by the committee in January.

However, was held from being reported out to city council as it was discovered to be in an industrial corridor and therefore had to appear before the plan commission. So the item was passed by the plan commission at its June 16th meeting with a change request of M22 Light Industry District to C33 Commercial, Manufacturing and Employment District. So Alderman Roboius moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, the records are incorporated. And just for the update of the committee, we have Mr. Moore here. You want to just quickly talk about this item?

[Speaker 16] (2:55:07 - 2:55:49)
Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. As the chairman just said, this was already passed by this committee and then it was discovered after the fact that we had to go to the plan commission. We were in front of the plan commission last week and the 40th ward, we had a community meeting.

There were no objections to this. It would create a beer garden at an existing brewery in an industrial area near no homes. And everyone seems very excited about it.

And we'd request your continued support, I guess.

[Speaker 1] (2:55:49 - 2:56:59)
Right. Thank you, Mr. Moore. We know we have the support of Alderman Vasquez.

Any questions, comments from committee members? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? So moved.

Alderman Beal makes the motion. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, this item will be passed as revised.

All right. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Moore. And our final item. Well, before we go back to the building. All right.

Top of page 10, document number 20992. In the 20th ward ordinance was referred on April 27th of 2022. Common address is 835 through 861 East 63rd Street.

Also 6301 through 25 South Maryland Avenue. And the change request. Residential business plan development number 1518 to residential business plan development number 1518 as amended.

Graham Brady on this application, sir. We have slides also.

[Speaker 12] (2:57:00 - 2:57:01)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman. Can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (2:57:02 - 2:57:04)
Yes, Graham. Good afternoon to you.

[Speaker 12] (2:57:05 - 2:57:39)
Chairman Tunney members of the Chicago plan commission. My name is William Grady. I'm a partner at the tap law firm.

And along with my colleague, Sylvia Micas, we're pleased to represent the applicant. In this case, 63rd, Maryland LLC. This project was approved by the Chicago plan commission for recommendation to the committee on zoning on June 16th.

We would ask two things. First, that the record of the plan commission hearing be incorporated into the record of the committee on zoning. And also the substitute ordinance that was recommended by the plan commission also be incorporated into the record of the committee on zoning.

[Speaker 30] (2:57:43 - 2:57:44)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (2:57:45 - 2:57:58)
Alderman Beal makes a motion to incorporate the records of the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the records are incorporated.

Would you continue, please?

[Speaker 12] (2:57:59 - 2:59:58)
Thank you, chairman and members. In addition to myself and Ms. Micas available to answer questions, Leon Walker and Tanya from BL3, Andrea Keeney from Michael's development, as well as Rick Whitney, the project architect at Fitzgerald and associates. If we could go to the next slide.

This application is basically in the form of a technical correction. Earlier on your agenda, you had a similar case where there was a survey that was in error. In this application, subsequent to the adoption of the plan development in September of 2021, it was discovered that the surveyor made an error on the plate of survey.

And as a result, the application needed to be redone. The survey eliminated or failed to include, rather, 823 square feet of the site area. There are no other changes to the project as it is presented to you today.

Same building in terms of height, floor area ratio, number of dwelling units, et cetera. It's really just a technical amendment to modify PD 1518 to have the correct size based upon a corrected survey. I'm happy to describe the project.

If we go to the next slide, just as a reminder of what the building looks like. This is just the left and right of the incorrect and the correct survey. And then this is the building, which may look familiar to you as this project was before you last September.

I'm happy to answer any questions you may have. By the view of the nature of the application, that is all we have. We also would like to thank Alderwoman Jeanette Taylor and her staff for her assistance.

The Alderwoman has provided a letter of support. We'd also like to thank the staff of the Department of Housing, Anna Booth, as well as staff of the Department of Planning and Development, Noah Sofranik, Patrick Brutus, and Lisa Washington. We're happy to answer any questions that you may have about this project.

[Speaker 1] (3:00:01 - 3:00:28)
Thank you, Graham. Obviously, we do have the support of Alderwoman Jeanette Taylor. Any questions, comments on this item?

If not, can I get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? So moved, Alderwoman Hadden. Alderwoman Hadden makes the motion.

Any objections to her motion? Hearing none, this item is passed as revised.

[Speaker 12] (3:00:28 - 3:00:51)
Chairman Tunney, I'd also like to thank Mr. Steve Valenziano for his... I wanted to thank and congratulate Mr. Steve Valenziano for his many years of dedicated service. As a former Zoning Administrator myself, I know and appreciate the hard work of a Deputy Zoning Administrator.

So Steve, congratulations and wish you all the best in retirement.

[Speaker 1] (3:00:53 - 3:02:06)
Thank you, Graham. All right. Now, we are going to go back to the first item on the second item on the agenda.

This is document number 02022-1753, Amendment of Municipal Code Section 414X-8-803.2 by modifying pooling requirements for nursing homes and senior housing facilities. So we have an amended substitute. All members of the committee should have received a copy of the substitute as well as a summary electronically.

And at this time, I would ask for a motion to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. So moved, Alderman Lopez. Alderman Raymond Lopez makes the motion to accept the substitute.

Any objections? Hearing none, the substitute is before us. All right.

Alderwoman Haddon and Commissioner Beaudet are available. We've spent a fair amount of time in the earlier part of this meeting. And I've got Alderwoman Haddon.

Do you want to start off the conversation, please?

[Speaker 3] (3:02:07 - 3:02:55)
Thank you, Chair. So just wanted to, I know we sent this out via email, just thanking my colleagues for the good discussion that we've had, knowing that we're going to continue working on the heating portion of this. And just want to let you know that everything here is the same.

We removed, or rather it's been, we're omitting the heating section from decision-making today. And we'll work with colleagues, Hopkins, Riley, Lopez, Endow, and others who would like to be involved in that to more fine-tune that so that we can get that ready well in time for the heating season. So I'm still pretty motivated to maybe hammer that out in the next couple of weeks, if you guys are open to it.

And Chair, I appreciate you giving us the time and the space to make sure we could act on the urgent part today.

[Speaker 1] (3:02:56 - 3:03:10)
Thank you, Alderwoman. Do I have any hands up questions? Let me just ask the Commissioner to reiterate what Alderwoman Haddon said.

We are taking out the section. What, can we just have it on the record, please?

[Speaker 4] (3:03:10 - 3:03:20)
Yes, Chairman. Section 14X-8-802, which is heating systems, has been removed from the substitute.

[Speaker 1] (3:03:21 - 3:03:28)
All right. Thank you, Matt. Alderman Hopkins, your hand is up.

[Speaker 2] (3:03:28 - 3:04:36)
Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Alderwoman Haddon, for your willingness to work with us on this. I will be voting aye in favor of the second substitute.

But I just do have one question for clarification from Commissioner Beaudet. Section 803.4 and section 803.6, I just need a clarification, because the first section, this is for the cooling center, by the way, the cooling center that will be required in residential high-rise buildings. 803.4 says the cooling center is required to operate when the temperature, the outside temperature is 92 degrees Fahrenheit. And then two sections later, it seems to imply that the cooling center needs to operate when the heat index is 80 degrees. Obviously, the heat index and the ambient temperature are different things. I'm just unclear on the relationship between these two sections.

Commissioner, can you just explain to us when the residential high-rise buildings of 100 units or more will be required to operate their cooling center rooms? Sure.

[Speaker 4] (3:04:37 - 3:04:46)
So you said 803.4 has 75 degrees. That's just the room temperature of what it needs to be.

[Speaker 6] (3:04:46 - 3:04:54)
But it says when the outside temperature is, in other words, when you have to open up your cooling room.

[Speaker 4] (3:04:55 - 3:05:01)
Yeah. All right. So it'd be, yeah, it'd be 92 degrees or 80 heat index, which are two separate.

[Speaker 30] (3:05:04 - 3:05:06)
And I can help as well.

[Speaker 4] (3:05:07 - 3:05:09)
Yeah, those are two separate measurements.

[Speaker 3] (3:05:10 - 3:05:12)
So it's either or.

[Speaker 30] (3:05:13 - 3:05:16)
All right. And Chairman. Alderman Hatton.

[Speaker 3] (3:05:17 - 3:06:26)
Yeah, so a good point there, Alderman Hopkins. I want to say this gets to some of the, I think, breadth that this ordinance goes into. So in that section 803.4, you see that this talks about the permanent cooling and dehumidification equipment. So it's one of the pieces. And I know it gives that outside guideline, but the section afterwards also is speaking broadly because you can see it's meaning safe indoor conditions for occupants. When the system's not available in the dwelling units, I think the operation piece speaks more broadly to all the instances, not just the large residential building units.

But this also looks to give some of those guidelines. And so the heat index piece was one of the most important things we saw in this. It's both for the cooling centers, but also some of these large residential buildings also have their own kind of systems that are not necessarily connected to the cooling centers.

[Speaker 2] (3:06:27 - 3:06:38)
Okay. And it seems to suggest that the cooling centers, the cooling rooms have to have equipment that isn't connected to the building central system. Is that correct?

[Speaker 30] (3:06:38 - 3:06:42)
It has to be separate after May 1st, 2024?

[Speaker 4] (3:06:44 - 3:06:52)
If it's a two pipe system where you can't do one or the other, then yes, the cooling centers in those buildings need to be on a separate system.

[Speaker 2] (3:06:52 - 3:07:16)
Okay. So if the room they're using for the cooling center happens to have a window, I'm assuming that a window air conditioning unit would qualify and that would be sufficient. If the room is an interior room and you can't use a window unit air conditioning system, what would be the alternative to have an air conditioning system that isn't connected to the building's air conditioning system?

How does that work?

[Speaker 4] (3:07:18 - 3:07:25)
Most of them are on the outside. I'm not aware of ones that are interior with no windows.

[Speaker 2] (3:07:27 - 3:07:40)
Well, you know, some kind of multipurpose room or a lobby, anything that doesn't necessarily have an exterior window under this ordinance that couldn't be used as the cooling center. Is that what you're saying?

[Speaker 4] (3:07:41 - 3:07:43)
Well, it could if they set a separate system up for it.

[Speaker 2] (3:07:44 - 3:08:13)
Okay. Yeah, I don't want to belabor this any longer. You know, I'm delayed it enough.

I understand that. I think a lot of this we can sort out later because we have until May 1st, 2024, right? Because portable equipment, that's pretty obvious what that is.

So you can just bring in a portable unit to run your cooling room. But I think we're going to have to also pay a little bit more attention to the detail here because it just isn't clear. But I don't want to hold this up any further.

So thank you, Commissioner. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:08:13 - 3:08:26)
Thank you. Thank you, Alderman. Thank you, Commissioner.

All right. Any more questions, comments? Otherwise, can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum on this substitute of the substitute?

[Speaker 30] (3:08:28 - 3:08:29)
Move to pass.

[Speaker 1] (3:08:30 - 3:09:07)
Alderman Hopkins makes the motion. Any objections to the motion? Hearing none, this item is passed as revised.

I'm sorry, it's passed as amended twice. All right. Before we ask for a motion to adjourn, I know this is, well, there it is.

Is that Steve? Yeah. Steve, would you like to address the committee here for a second?

Or do you want us to talk about you?

[Speaker 27] (3:09:07 - 3:09:10)
Well, I just like to say- Roast you.

[Speaker 1] (3:09:10 - 3:09:15)
I know with the fish, I can't, I don't know how to- All right, Steve.

[Speaker 27] (3:09:16 - 3:09:53)
I would just like to say, thanks to everyone, all the aldermen. I've enjoyed, really have enjoyed working with all of you. Present and past.

And I've learned a lot from many of you. And, you know, I've tried to do my best to serve you and your constituents and, you know, and to be fair and helpful is to the best of my ability. And it's, I'm going to, I am going to miss the place and I'm going to miss the work that we do here.

So thank you. Thank you, Steve.

[Speaker 5] (3:09:55 - 3:10:29)
Alderman Lopez, would you, your hand is up. Yes, chairman. Thank you.

I figured in honor of Steve's last zoning committee, I would speak for the next 45 minutes on the need for zoning reform in the city of, no, I'm just kidding. Steve, congratulations. I was sad to see that you're retiring, but it's very well deserved.

I'm sure all of the fish are going to be scared from the Northern Pikes on down, but wish you all the best and look forward to seeing you as a civilian, just walking around and enjoying Chicago.

[Speaker 1] (3:10:32 - 3:10:38)
Thank you. Alderman, all older woman, Carrie Austin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 14] (3:10:39 - 3:11:20)
Steve, so I'll say on behalf of myself and my chief of staff, Chester Wilson, we thank you for all that you have taught us in regards to zoning, because without your input and help, I don't know if I could have learned as much as I have, but we thank you and I know that I'll miss you because then it's like, oh, let me go, Steve. So, but I like your little saying here, enjoy your, you are officially retired. That is really cute.

But for such an outstanding gentleman, I want to thank you so much for all of the service that you have given to us in the 34.

[Speaker 1] (3:11:21 - 3:11:24)
Thank you. Thank you, Alderwoman. Alderwoman Haddon.

[Speaker 3] (3:11:27 - 3:11:44)
Steve, I am sad to see you go. I love this picture and I love that pun. You've been such a fantastic resource to myself and my team in my three years, and so really appreciate you.

Thank you for your service to the city and you will definitely be missed. Thanks.

[Speaker 30] (3:11:46 - 3:11:47)
Alderman Dowell.

[Speaker 11] (3:11:49 - 3:12:37)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I felt rushed the last time. I've known Steve since he was a pup and I was a pup.

So it is with a heavy heart that I am saying goodbye to you, Steve. You're just tremendous. You've been very helpful to the third ward and helping us make some really important decisions.

I value your friendship and I'm glad that we had an opportunity to work together within the planning department when we were both starting out. And I wish you the best as you retire, although I can't believe you're retiring. You're much too young to do that.

[Speaker 30] (3:12:37 - 3:12:42)
So take care and I'll see you walking around the South Loop somewhere.

[Speaker 27] (3:12:43 - 3:12:44)
Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 30] (3:12:45 - 3:12:46)
All right, Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 6] (3:12:50 - 3:14:16)
Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman. So yeah, it's challenging to see Steve leave. He's last at a goombah up there in the planning department.

You know, Steve, I'm trying to see if I can get into the cigar smoking like you do, man. I wish you well. You deserve to leave, but it would have been better if you would have went up further in the department and stayed.

You have a wealth of knowledge. I appreciate all of the laws that you helped to write with the PMDs. I mean, you're the expert.

You always answer my calls day and night, and I just really appreciate you, man. We're going to miss you, but go out there and kick it with, you know, all the other guys who went before you, all of your other goombahs who left before you, and you guys have a good time. I wish you well, man.

Thank you for your service to the city of Chicago. You've done a great service, Steve. I mean, people have no idea the wealth of knowledge that you have and how helpful you have been for all of us.

So I just want to say grazie, grazie, and ciao, bro. Peace.

[Speaker 1] (3:14:18 - 3:14:34)
Any other members of the committee would like to give their kudos and good luck? Is Commissioner Baudet, Matt, do you have a- Yes.

[Speaker 4] (3:14:34 - 3:15:02)
Yes, thank you. Thank you for leaving to speak. Steve, we go back a long time.

You're an honorary member of the building department. And just to let everyone know, nothing we've accomplished over the past years as far as code reform and streamlining the permit process couldn't have been achieved without Steve. So Steve, thank you.

You're an old St. Ed's guy. So enjoy your retirement, my friend. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:15:03 - 3:15:13)
Well, Steve, on behalf of the entire city council, everyone's had their interface with you. Just a quick question. How many years have you been with the department?

[Speaker 27] (3:15:14 - 3:15:18)
33 years and about six or seven months.

[Speaker 1] (3:15:19 - 3:15:58)
Older than half my staff that's on this planet, I think. But that being said, I've had the opportunity to work with you from day one. We've crossed a lot of issues together.

But on behalf of the staff and the residents of 44, good luck to you. As was said, you've got a second or third life ahead of you, and I'm sure you'll be fine. So really appreciate all your work.

Thank you. Okay. All right.

That's Nicole. Yes. All right.

So. Without no further business, can I get a motion to adjourn?

[Speaker 3] (3:15:59 - 3:16:01)
So moved. All the women had.

[Speaker 1] (3:16:01 - 3:16:08)
