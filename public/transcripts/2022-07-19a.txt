And that would be our first public speaker. Is it Eric or Erica? Eric?

Eric Wise. And we do have Alderman Osterman on the roll call. Thank you.

Eric Wise.

[Speaker 24] (8:34 - 8:36)
Yes, hello. Can you all hear me now?

[Speaker 1] (8:36 - 8:38)
We can hear you, proceed please.

[Speaker 24] (8:39 - 11:50)
Wonderful. So yes, I'm Eric Wise. I'm a housing organizer with Palenque LS&A, and I would like to testify in support of the Connected Communities Ordinance.

So Palenque LS&A believes that racial equity is a matter of public policy, and we know that the Connected Community Ordinance is a step closer to a more racially equitable Chicago. The POD report that came out, a policy plan that came out last year said that investment is almost exclusively in wealthy and gentrifying north side communities. And we know that that's a huge problem.

So what Palenque LS&A really appreciates about the Connected Communities Ordinance is that it's so contextual. Like a provision that would work in Washington Park might not work in Logan Square or might not work in Lincoln Park or Ravenswood. So we know that like, you're viewing these different neighborhoods in different ways is really, really important to end the extreme racial and economic segregation in our city.

So something specifically that I really like and that we really like is the high-frequency and strategic bus gets E-POD incentives. So this is really great for neighborhoods like Belmont-Greigan or Hermosa and West Humboldt Park and West Logan Square that don't really have direct access to one of the high-frequency train lines. So allowing more affordable apartments and more walkable areas in these neighborhoods that are less so now is really important, particularly because these neighborhoods that I've just mentioned are predominantly black, brown and low income.

And specifically for Logan Square, the ordinance is fantastic because one of the contextual approaches is working to fight gentrification. Gentrification has really wrecked Logan Square. It's not gone yet, but areas right along the blue line where working class Latinx families used to live to access the huge amounts of jobs in both the Loop and the airport may be able to do so again as affordable housing is forced to be built along that blue line.

And we really appreciate that, the process to create this ordinance. Elevated Chicago led the process and they reached out to so many different people and so many different organizations, all across the city. And I think that's rare to see and it's really important to see, particularly when we're trying to do something so big, such as create this ETOD ordinance, something that is really kind of special across the United States.

And there's all of these specifics about why this ordinance is so good, but it's also just good overall. It's going to improve pedestrian safety, it's going to increase walkability and transit access in neighborhoods that don't previously had it or previously missed out on TOD investment in the past. And then it's also great for youth and seniors who don't have access to cars, who don't want to drive and who need to get around the city too, for recreation, for cultural events, for all these things that we need the city for, the ETOD ordinance, the Connected Communities Ordinance would allow them to live closer to transit and to access all.

Thank you, Eric. Our next speaker, Justin Williams.

[Speaker 26] (11:52 - 11:54)
Hello, can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (11:54 - 11:55)
We can, proceed, Justin.

[Speaker 26] (11:56 - 14:42)
Hello, I'm Justin Williams, policy manager at the Metropolitan Planning Council, and I'm speaking in support of the Connected Communities Ordinance as well. Every Chicago resident deserves ready access to the thriving communities that transit creates. And for that reason, NPC is really proud to support the Connected Communities Ordinance because it brings the benefits of transit-oriented development to more residents citywide and creates an economically stronger Chicago.

Since 2015, 325 projects producing nearly 90,000 housing units citywide have been built in transit-served locations, incentivized by measures put in place through the 2013 and 2015 TOD ordinances. Unfortunately, the benefits of those developments have not been shared among all Chicagoans. Between 2016 and 2018, 90% of TOD developments were concentrated in downtown, near north and northwest side neighborhoods.

Large swaths of the south and west side saw no TOD development. Additionally, TOD occurred in gentrifying areas, which saw gains in white population and losses in black populations, while only 6.5% of units built in transit-served locations were affordable under the Affordable Requirements Ordinance. One of the ways that Connected Communities addresses these inequities is by expanding TOD incentives and facilitating more balanced development citywide.

The ordinance expands where TOD incentives can be applied to within a half mile from rail stations and a quarter mile of high-frequency bus routes. This change dramatically increases the amount of TOD-eligible parcels in Chicago. Excuse me.

Presently, TOD incentives are available to 31 million square feet of parcels across the city. Under Connected Communities, that number increases to 402 million square feet, an increase of nearly 1,200%. Of the communities that have the most area eligible for density bonuses under Connected Communities, 11 of 20 are majority BIPOC South and West Side communities.

The 95th Street corridor between Cottage Grove and Halsted provides an example of how the ordinance can accelerate development initiatives in South and West Side communities. The ordinance offers incentives to develop underutilized parcels along 95th Street, building a strong pipeline of projects from the Metro Station to the East, the Pace-Polk line to the West, and the 95th Street Red Line Terminal as a central anchor. By expanding where TOD can happen, Connected Communities makes important strides in bringing TOD to Chicagoans who currently don't benefit.

Additionally, the ordinance is a major jobs engine. MPC estimates that the ordinance will create 50,000 jobs per year in construction, retail, manufacturing, and related industries. This is a major win for employment, affordability, and thriving communities.

MPC urges a yes vote for Connected Communities. Thank you for your consideration.

[Speaker 1] (14:44 - 14:47)
Thank you. Our next speaker, Elliot Richardson.

[Speaker 35] (14:49 - 17:08)
Hi, thank you to the committee for this opportunity to testify. My name is Elliot Richardson, and I am the president of the Small Business Advocacy Council. The SBAC is a nonpartisan organization that advocates for small businesses and local communities.

The SBAC supports the Connected Communities Ordinance because many neighborhood business districts in Chicago are struggling. Local businesses cannot sustain themselves in these commercial quarters because there's just simply too little foot traffic or economic activity. This contributes to vacancies, which foster crime.

A lack of commerce in neighborhood business districts makes it difficult to create jobs in local communities. The Connected Communities Ordinance will help bring more residents to areas near transit. And that means more customers for small businesses in nearby commercial corridors.

Simply put, making it easier for people to live near public transit can help revitalize commercial quarters which struggled before the pandemic, and they continue to struggle. A thriving community near transit should also attract a wide range of small businesses. Too often we hear about fast food being the only option in commercial quarters in disadvantaged communities.

More people should attract more types of businesses in commercial quarters near transit. That should create energy and opportunities. The incentives in the Connected Communities Ordinance can bring more foot traffic, more options for local consumers, more opportunities for local entrepreneurs, more tax revenue derived from thriving small businesses, more jobs, and more businesses in neighborhood business districts in all areas of Chicago near transit.

This ordinance can also foster economic growth so vacant properties on the South and West side near transit can be replaced with thriving small businesses. And that is why it's so important for local communities on near transit to see more foot traffic and more activity. Supporting small businesses and local business districts is always important.

It is always important. And it is especially crucial now as Chicago emerges from the pandemic. The SBAC urges this committee to support the ordinance.

And I want to thank you all so much for your time.

[Speaker 1] (17:12 - 17:15)
All right. Our next speaker is Jackie Grimshaw.

[Speaker 50] (17:16 - 17:18)
Jackie Grimshaw, Jackie Grimshaw, Jackie Grimshaw.

[Speaker 26] (17:22 - 17:23)
Let's try it again.

[Speaker 50] (17:23 - 17:28)
Jackie. Jackie, Jackie, Jackie, Jackie, Jackie, Jackie. I can't hear from here.

[Speaker 29] (17:31 - 17:42)
Jackie, you're on two devices. If you can please log out of one device. Maybe you're calling from two numbers.

Just disconnect one number, just be on one.

[Speaker 1] (17:47 - 17:48)
All right. Let's try it again.

[Speaker 40] (17:49 - 17:49)
Jackie Grimshaw.

[Speaker 23] (17:56 - 21:02)
Thank you. Good morning. My name is Jackie Grimshaw and I'm Vice President for Governmental Affairs at the Center for Neighborhood Technology and I live in Hyde Park.

I welcome the opportunity to testify today in support of Connect the Communities Ordinance. Thank you for the opportunity. Elevated Chicago and our supporters are dedicated to revitalizing existing communities through equitable transit-oriented developments.

ECODS should result in healthy communities where all the necessities of life are easily available. And if needed services are not near hand are easily reachable either by transit, bicycling or walking. The Chicago metropolitan area is one of the most comprehensive and far-reaching mass transit systems available in the US.

We have a wealth of communities that grew up around transit nodes. The Elevated's goal in advancing the ECODS Ordinance was to incentivize a welcoming environment for investments of mixed use, mixed income, equitable transit-oriented developments. ECODS two main objectives are household economic security and climate change.

ECODS increased density and the inclusion of high-frequency bus routes with lower vehicle ownership and car use provide more transportation choice and better availability to amenities and jobs. The principle of economic development of good mass transit is to lower the cost of living by lowering automobile dependence regardless of income. Our transit system has been built and now is the time to focus on connectivity of our communities.

By doing so, we not only reduce the cost of living but also improve quality of life. Air pollution, greenhouse gases, time away from family, stuck in traffic are quality of life burdens. Communities of colors of those with high economic hardships are disproportionately burdened by these as well as the impact of traffic crashes, a lack of reliable transportation option and environmental concerns.

These historic black and brown areas that might otherwise undergo revitalization are pockmarked with surface parking lots deadened by for loan booking buildings, caulked with debris strewn empty lots thus hindered in their efforts to create new jobs and attract new businesses. Think about zoning ordinance. If you just consider that Chicago's new zoning ordinance should encourage a variety of housing options for everyone who wants to live in the city.

Zoning rules should include specific provisions for mixed use developments so that residents will have readily available sources for the goods and services they want and need. Zoning rules must accommodate the public need for open space. Our zoning code should put a high priority on public transit and non-motorized transportation.

Our zoning code should result in a welcoming environment for investments in mixed use, mixed income transit or in development without mandating many more parking spaces than needed. And the zoning code should encourage and reward energy conservation and environment.

[Speaker 50] (21:02 - 21:04)
Thank you, Jackie.

[Speaker 1] (21:05 - 21:14)
And thank you for your years of service to the city. I just wanted to point that out for members of the zoning committee. Our next speaker is Janet Lin.

[Speaker 22] (21:15 - 21:17)
Good morning, you can hear me?

[Speaker 1] (21:17 - 21:19)
We can Janet, proceed.

[Speaker 22] (21:19 - 24:22)
Okay. Good morning, esteemed committee members. My name is Janet Lin.

I am the president of the Chicago Board of Health. I would like to take this opportunity today to read key portions of a resolution that has been approved by the board in support of the proposed connected communities ordinance. The resolution is also available in full underwritten comments if I am unable to get through the entire document.

So whereas all Chicagoans deserve the opportunity to live healthy lives, and whereas Chicagoans have inequitable health outcomes based on race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, gender, geography, and other variables. And whereas as of 2020, the gap in life expectancy between black and white Chicagoans has 10 years with 10 years up from 8.8 years in 2017. And for the first time in decades, life expectancy for black residents of Chicago fell below 70 years.

And whereas Latinx residents of Chicago saw a three year decline in life expectancy between 2019 and 2020, the steepest drop of any racial or ethnic group had lost a total of seven years of life expectancy since 2012 or excuse me, 2012. And whereas healthy Chicago 2025, Chicago's current five year community health improvement plan recognizes that systemic sources, including housing, food access, environment, public safety, and neighborhood planning and development are root drivers of health. And whereas healthy Chicago 2025 places a special focus on health and racial equity, articulating the following vision for Chicago, a city where all people in all communities have power, are free from oppression, and are strengthened by equitable access to resources, environments, and opportunities that promote optimal health and wellbeing.

And whereas recognizing that achieving health equity requires transforming policies and processes across institutions, CDPH is a founding member of Elevated Chicago, a community led organization formed to bring a racial equity lens to urban planning and development, transit, public health, and other drivers of community wellbeing. And where the city of Chicago, CDPH and Elevated Chicago are aligned in recognizing that equity is both a process and an outcome. And in order to realize equity, communities most impacted by inequities must be engaged as experts in their own experiences, strategists in co-creating solutions, and evaluators in success.

And whereas to fulfill a mandate from city council in 2020, the city developed an equitable transit oriented development policy plan to convey Chicago's approach to equitable, healthy, and sustainable development near transit hubs and corridors. The ETOD policy plan is the result of collaboration between the 80 plus community, nonprofit, and city leaders along the developers, artists, environmentalists, organizers, and public input. And whereas the city's ETOD policy plan was adopted in 2021 by the Chicago Plan Commission, and the ETOD policy identified several priorities, which required city council action to implement.

And whereas the Connected Communities Ordinance was therefore introduced to city council on June 22nd, 2022, after being collaboratively.

[Speaker 1] (24:25 - 24:28)
Thank you, Janet. Our next speaker, Nedra Fears.

[Speaker 25] (24:31 - 27:33)
Good morning. My name is Nedra Sims Fears. I'm a Chatham resident and executive director of the Greater Chatham Initiative.

We are a community-based organization focused on revitalizing the Chatham, Auburn-Gresham, Haviland Park, and Greater Grand Crossing neighborhoods on Chicago's South Side. We work with across a wide range of areas to support that revitalization. One of those areas is housing.

During the last five years, Greater Chatham's four-cell housing has continued to increase in price, attracting purchasers who previously lived throughout the South Side. The new families are mostly in their 40s. Our neighborhoods are missing young adults from ages 18 to 39 years.

We are challenged to retrain, to retain, and attract young millennials and Generation Z residents. And while we have many beautiful and historic single-family homes, the lack of new apartments and multifamily development makes it less appealing for young people to stay in the area after they graduate from school. So therefore, we support the Connected Communities Ordinance for three main reasons.

First, by expanding the area for ETOD incentives, we will have more opportunities to attract investment to our community. We have already started to see some ETOD investments, such as with our partner, the Carter Temple CME Church Development, located at 79th and State, which will bring housing and retail to the 79th Street Corridor, which is right next to the Red Line. By expanding the radius for ETOD benefits near rail stations and adding more bus lines, we'll have more opportunities to attract investment, both private and publicly funded.

Second, in addition to providing more housing choices for residents and young people, density also helps our businesses. Greater Chatham's Restaurant Row on 76th Street includes over a dozen family-owned businesses that employ more than 200 residents. More density nearby, including a nearby bus route, means more purchasing power and support for those businesses.

Finally, as we all know, Chicago has a long and bitter history of segregation and disinvestment. We believe that sustainable growth requires inclusion and that inequity hurts all of us. In addition to supporting more investment on the South Side, this ordinance also ensures that we can add more housing and especially more affordable housing in every part of the city.

Chicago's segregation serves as a fundamental barrier to our success as a city.

[Speaker 1] (27:35 - 27:38)
Our next speaker, Henry Barlow.

[Speaker 37] (27:47 - 29:56)
Good morning to everybody. My name is Reverend Dr. Henry Barlow, pastor of the Morning Star Baptist Church of Chicago, located in Bronzeville, right at the corner of 40th and King Drive. And I also sit on the board of Insight Hospital and Medical Center.

I'm coming on behalf of the residents of Bronzeville who have had a hospital for years to go to, and unfortunately it closed and now it's back open again. And unfortunately many of the residents don't know that the hospital is open because there's no signage on the building. I pastor about 65% of my members live in the Paul G.

Stewart Senior Building, which is right next door to my hospital, next door to the church actually. And many of them were residents that in that area went to that hospital. They've come by my church many times.

I've talked with many of the members asking if there was anything that could be done to get the hospital back open. Well, finally we got the hospital open and a lot of them are still a little confused about whether or not it's open for business or not because there's no signs out there. We're coming today asking if there's anything that can be done that would change that.

For over a hundred years, we've had that hospital in the Bronzeville area and it is needed in that area. Many times when many of my members get sick in church, we have to call the paramedics and a lot of times they're not able to take them to the University of Chicago, which is the next closest hospital. They end up having to take them to Mount Sinai or either to St. Bernard Hospital, which is really unfair when we have a hospital right there in that community. So I'm asking that this committee would give great consideration to that, not only as a board member, but as a faith leader in that Bronzeville area. Thank you for your patience and your attention.

[Speaker 1] (29:59 - 30:03)
Our next speaker is Mike Thomas. Thomas.

[Speaker 27] (30:07 - 32:51)
Hello, my name is Mike Thomas, a resident of Garfield Park and the Executive Director of the Garfield Park Community Council. I wanna thank you for the opportunity to speak in favor of the proposed Connected Communities Ordinance today. The Garfield Park Community Council spoke in favor of the Transit-Oriented Development Policy in 2019 and we've been part of the working group ever since.

In 2021, we started working on the Equitable Transit-Oriented Development Policy Implementation Plan and have been supporting equitable Transit-Oriented Development Pilot Projects across the city. This ordinance has been in the works for years. Garfield Park Community Council and dedicated residents have worked to bring the hatchery, a food and beverage business incubator, adjacent to the Kedzie Green Line stop to the neighborhood.

In fact, our volunteer urban ag project has physical space in the development. Currently, staff and volunteers are working with affordable housing developer to bring a housing project two blocks from the Kedzie Blue Line stop. We are transit rich in Garfield Park with both the green, blue, bus routes, Metro.

This ordinance will extend Transit-Oriented Development incentives to all quarters with high frequency services. Transit is critical to working families in Garfield Park on Chicago's West Side. In fact, in the first year of the pandemic, the Conservatory Green Line stop in Garfield Park, the Pulaski Blue Line stop in Garfield Park both retain the highest ridership than any other station in the CTA network according to the Urban Institute.

This ordinance is important. It caps the amount of onsite parking and new residential developments to one spot for two units, which results in more units. The proposed development that I mentioned earlier that are two blocks away from the Kedzie Blue Line only has 15 parking spots in the 43 unit development.

And that's focused on residents and families earning between 38 and 80% AMI. This ordinance would also require an administrative adjustment to build new curb cuts and driveways near rail stations. We've been working with CDOT over the years to add more pedestrian islands and bump ups to slow down traffic and make it more walkable near our transit and our adjacent neighborhood schools and our retail quarters.

Finally, the proposed ordinance prevents deconversions in communities facing displacement, which means that affordable tree plants can't be gutted and turned into expensive single family housing without a zoning change. We are currently experiencing that right now near the California Green Line stop. And we look forward to working with our aldermen to vet those zoning changes with our neighbors.

In closing, the Garfield Park Community Council supports the Connected Communities Ordinance and encourages each member of this committee to vote yes. Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (32:56 - 33:57)
All right, that concludes the public comment portion of the hearing. We have been joined by committee member Sawyer for the forum call and we have non-committee members, Mitz, Napolitano, O'Shea and Maldonado. Anybody else?

All right. Okay, we'll start off today with the addendum to the agenda. The first item on the addendum is document number A-2022-101, the appointment of Angela D.

Brooks as a member of the Zoning Board of Appeals for a term effective immediately and expiring July 1, 2025 to complete the unexpired term of Jolene Saul, who has resigned. All committee members should have received an electronic copy of Angela Brooks' resume and we have her here to speak on the appointment. Ms. Brooks.

[Speaker 18] (34:02 - 34:14)
Good morning, everyone. I am Angela Brooks. I'm not sure what you need me to say, Chair Tony, but I'm here, I'm excited for the opportunity.

I've been a planner for over 25 years.

[Speaker 14] (34:14 - 34:24)
I am the director of the Corporation for Supportive Housing here in Illinois. Previously, I was a development manager for the Chicago Housing Authority. I left there almost two years ago.

[Speaker 1] (34:27 - 34:42)
Thank you, Angela. I know the committee members have received your resume. Do we have any questions, comments from committee members?

All right, no questions by committee members.

[Speaker 7] (34:43 - 34:43)
We have a comment.

[Speaker 1] (34:45 - 34:46)
Alderwoman Dowell.

[Speaker 7] (34:48 - 35:22)
Yes, I just have a comment. I wanted to just let my committee members know that this is an excellent appointment to the ZBA. I was wondering if it was the same Angela Brooks, but when I saw the D, I knew it was you.

I know that you have a sensitivity for our Chicago neighborhoods and I think this is a great appointment. And so I wish you well, Angela. Thank you, Alderman Dowell, I appreciate it.

Happy to see you again.

[Speaker 1] (35:23 - 36:08)
All right, any other questions, comments? If not, can I get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? So moved.

Alderwoman Dowell makes the motion. Any objections to her motion? Hearing none, this appointment is passed and we look forward to working with you on the ZBA.

Thank you, Ms. Brooks. Thank you. All right, now we're going on to two landmark designations.

The first is document number 02022-1791 in the 26th ward. The historical landmark designation for the Paseo. Tell me what it is.

Barica, that's an Anglo talking now.

[Speaker 8] (36:08 - 36:11)
I'll get there, I'll get there, Alderman Maldonado.

[Speaker 1] (36:11 - 36:26)
The gateway flags located at West Division Street and Artesian Avenue, 2400 West and North Mozart Street, 2800 West. All right, we have Matt Crawford here from the Department of Landmarks and Planning. Matt.

[Speaker 34] (36:26 - 37:25)
Thanks, Chairman Toney. Good morning. For the record, Matt Crawford, planner with the Department of Planning and Development.

The Commission on Chicago Landmarks recommends to this body that the Paseo Barica flags be designated as a Chicago landmark. The two gateway flags mark a one half mile section of Division Street in the Humboldt Park neighborhood, a stretch known as Paseo Barica, which is the economic, social and cultural heart of Chicago's Puerto Rican community. This would be the first landmark designation that recognizes the contributions of the Puerto Rican community.

In Chicago, these towering steel sculptures portray the flag of Puerto Rico, long a symbol of Puerto Rican consciousness and self-determination. Alderman Maldonado of the 26th Ward is in full support of the designation as a CDOT, which is charged with maintenance of these sculptures. So on behalf of the Landmarks Commission, I recommend passage of the designation.

Happy to answer any questions that you have.

[Speaker 1] (37:27 - 37:48)
All right. We're gonna hear from Alderman Maldonado on this. Thank you, Matt.

Before we hear from... I have a question for Matt. You talked about the maintenance.

This is a very large sign. And how does that work in terms of maintaining the sign, expense-wise?

[Speaker 34] (37:49 - 38:09)
CDOT has a budget for maintaining these kinds of streetway sculptures. It's a relatively simple design. It's all tubular steel that is painted.

And I'm assured from CDOT that this sculpture is in good condition and well-maintained.

[Speaker 1] (38:11 - 38:17)
All right. Thank you, Matt. Let's go to Alderman Maldonado.

[Speaker 21] (38:23 - 41:38)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. I wanna first say, Mr. Chairman, that back in 1995, during the tenure of my predecessor, Billy Ocasio, on Three Kings Day on January 6th and on the centennial of the anniversary of the Puerto Rican flag, I was present at the ceremony of the dedication of the Paseo Boricua Gateway flags just one year after I became elected as county commissioner for the 8th District. Little did I know that on July 2022, in my role as Alderman of the 26th Ward, I will be a witness and play in a role in the final designation of the Puerto Rican flags along Division Street as a Chicago Historical Landmark.

I came up with the idea to propose the Puerto Rican flags along Division Street as a Chicago Historical Landmark when I saw what my brother and colleague from the 22nd Ward did with the arts on 22nd Street. Needless to say, I immediately copied what Alderman Michael Rodriguez did in the 22nd Ward. Thank you, Alderman, for that great idea that you gave me.

This is an additional symbol, Mr. Chairman, of ethnic pride of our Puerto Rican community and another means to continue the struggle to slow down gentrification of our Puerto Rican community. Let me just close by profoundly express my deepest sense of gratitude to Matt Crawford from the Landmark Commission. He really has been very instrumental in pushing the commission to get to this point and forever I'm gonna be grateful to you, Matt, and also to Commissioner of CIVAD, Commissioner Biagi that from the very first moment, she was also very supportive of this great idea.

And also to Dr. Jose Lopez from the Puerto Rican Cultural Center for being a visionary and a steadfast leader of our Puerto Rican community. And for the free talent he offered the commission with the narrative to meet all seven criteria the commission uses to recommend landmark status of objects, structures, and the like for potential landmark designation. So thank you again, Mr. Chairman, and I hope to get your support and the committee's support to on this final step in this process that we have undertaken for the last several months. Thank you so very much.

[Speaker 1] (41:40 - 41:49)
Thank you, Alderman Maldonado and congratulations. We do have Alderman Felix Cardona that would like to speak on this item.

[Speaker 50] (41:50 - 41:51)
Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 48] (41:52 - 42:59)
I would like to thank my colleague, Alderman Roberto Maldonado for doing this to foresee and also professor Dr. Lopez, Jose Lopez for his vision. But I just want to comment that in 1995, I was there with my dad. His name is in the Puerto Rican community named as People Cardona.

He was vice president of the Puerto Rican Parade Committee at the time. And when I was 18, when this happened, I saw this symbol being brought to Humboldt Park, which gave us pride and joy. And I just want to comment and congratulate my colleague for doing something great for our community.

And also if my dad was alive, I know that he would have tears coming down his eyes seeing this and be in flourishment. In flourishment. So on that, I do pass this ordinance.

Thank you. All right.

[Speaker 1] (42:59 - 43:22)
Thank you, Alderman Cardona. Any questions, other questions, comments? Otherwise, Alderman Cardona moves to pass on this item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Again, Alderman Cardona moves to pass. Any objections? Hearing none, this ordinance is passed.

Congrats to everybody.

[Speaker 21] (43:22 - 43:24)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee.

[Speaker 1] (43:25 - 43:48)
Thank you so very much. Next we have document number 02022-1792 in the fourth ward, the historical landmark designation for the Monumental Baptist Church located at 729 East Oakwood Boulevard. Again, Matt Crawford from our city planner is here to present.

Matt, would you talk on this item in the fourth ward please?

[Speaker 34] (43:49 - 44:30)
Thank you, Chairman. Honey, the Landmarks Commission recommends to council that the Monumental Baptist Church be designated as a Chicago landmark. The church stands at 729 East Oakwood Boulevard in the Bronzeville neighborhood and fourth ward Alderman King has expressed her full support for landmark designation.

The commission found that the building meets criteria for designation for its architecture, but even more so for its long heritage as a place of culture and social uplift in Bronzeville. The congregation has requested landmark designation to highlight this legacy. I'm happy to answer any questions that you may have.

[Speaker 1] (44:35 - 44:45)
Thank you, Matt. We do have the Pastor Lee, I believe, that would like to speak on this item. Pastor, proceed.

[Speaker 49] (44:45 - 45:51)
Yes, thank you so much Chairman Toomey. Once again, Pastor Cleopas Lee. A Monumental Baptist Church is one of Chicago's historical African-American Baptist churches with a heritage that goes back 103 years, all of which has been serving in the Bronzeville community.

As a congregation, we are proud of the historical significance and role our church has played and continues to play in the community. It is with this pride that drives us in our pursuit to obtain landmark designation. And upon approval, we are hoping to leverage the landmark designation status in our efforts to fundraise for the complete restoration of our building.

With the complete restoration, we will be able to create a safe space for community youth. We'll be able to develop activities for seniors. We'll be able to put on educational, a variety of educational workshops and many other opportunities to serve the community.

And so with that, I would like to say thank you for this opportunity to be considered and we look forward to your decision. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (45:51 - 45:59)
Thank you, Pastor. Any questions for the department or the guest speaker?

[Speaker 12] (45:59 - 46:01)
No questions, so moved by Alderman David Moore.

[Speaker 1] (46:02 - 46:29)
All right, hearing no questions, comments, more, I'm sorry, Alderman David Moore makes motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, this ordinance is passed.

Thank you. All right, next, we'll move on to the code amendments. I'm sorry, Alderwoman Dowell, did you wanna speak on that item?

[Speaker 7] (46:29 - 46:39)
You know, I just wanted to congratulate Reverend Lee and Alderman King on this, but I just wanted to know who the architect was for this.

[Speaker 34] (46:41 - 46:54)
Did I miss that? Matt? Yeah, Alderman Dowell, it was Patton, Fisher, and Miller.

They were an important architecture firm in Chicago in the late 19th century, specializing in churches.

[Speaker 8] (46:56 - 46:57)
Okay, thank you.

[Speaker 1] (46:58 - 47:38)
All right, thank you, Alderwoman. All right, so now we're gonna move on to code amendments. The first is document number 02022-2000, the amendment of municipal code chapter 17-2 17-3, 17-4, 17-10, 17-13, and 17-17 regarding equitable transit oriented developments.

This item has a substitute. All members of the committee should have received a copy of the substitute as well as a summary electronically. And at this time, I would ask for a motion to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

[Speaker 46] (47:38 - 47:39)
So moved, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (47:40 - 47:55)
Alderman Roboyas makes the motion to accept the substitute. Any objections? Hearing none, the substitute is before us.

We will start with Housing Commissioner Marissa Navarro to present on this matter. Commissioner.

[Speaker 2] (47:58 - 59:25)
Thank you, Chairman. Thank you, members of the committee. I'm pleased to walk through this ordinance along with my colleagues, Juan Sebastian Nadia from the mayor's office and Daniel Hertz from the Department of Housing.

We are also joined by developer Leon Walker and Elevated Chicago committee members, Roberto Raquejo and Melvin Thompson. Jumping in here, I wanna just walk through why we are excited about this ordinance as one that creates jobs, improves pedestrian safety and increases affordable housing near Chicago's public transit. So I also wanna give a bit of history here because it has been over three years in the making.

Back in 2019, at the end of the last administration, an ordinance was passed that directed the administration to create an equitable TOD plan. And that really got underway under Mayor Lightfoot's administration. So from 2019 to 2021, there was engagement with over 80 stakeholders and experts to create the ETOD plan.

And we worked very closely with a group called Elevated Chicago, which is why you'll hear from them later. Together, we came up with an ETOD plan. It was open for public comment.

It was adopted unanimously by plan commission in June, 2021. And then since June and today, we have been working to adapt the policy plan into an ordinance. And so last month introduced the connected communities ordinance, which is a result of that work.

I do wanna note a really high level of support across communities and citywide groups for this work and for this end product. So you can see community groups ranging from Garfield Park Community Council, Logan Square Neighborhood Association, Far South CDC, Latinos Progresando, Rage Englewood, and then citywide groups like the Chicago Urban League, Federation of Labor, Metropolitan Planning Council, Small Business Advocacy Council, et cetera. And many more, so many that we could not fit them on a slide and are showing you their logos to show you the ones we couldn't fit on the slide.

So truly a very high level of collaboration and work together and building from the ground up of requests at the community level for the kinds of development that folks wanna see. So let's, I would like to spend a moment on why the focus on equitable, inequitable TOD. When we took a look, next slide please.

When we took a look at developments that had benefited from the transit oriented development incentives since 2013, what we found was that the vast majority of them were on the North side, the near North side, West loop, downtown, in fact, 90% of developments. From 2013 to 2020 were not on the South and West side where we know that we also have ample train, L metro and bus service. And so at that point, we knew we had a lot of work to do to write the inequities of how these incentives were being applied in communities.

And we took a lot of that work on ourselves as an administration. So next advancement here, I wanna just show in our last funding round in December, 2021, we announced that of 24 developments, fully half of them, 12 would be transit oriented developments on the South and West side. So right there, it's a massive shift that we have already made as an administration to say, this is what we're funding.

This is what we're committed to. And we're committed to building up people's options to live near transit all over the city. Here's another measure just to look at how the experience of Chicagoans is not equitable when it comes in this case to pedestrian safety.

So of the 47 designated pedestrian streets, only eight are on the South and West sides, a disparity that contributes to disproportionate deaths and injuries and car crashes. We do have the highest rates of traffic and pedestrian fatalities on the South and West sides. In fact, they're four times higher for black residents than non-black residents.

And on the South and West sides, we have the highest rate of non-car ownership. So we really in these areas should be, if anything, building and pushing for more transit use and pedestrian safety near those transit stops as possible. Next slide.

So I wanna also make sure that because we're going to be spending time talking about what's in this ordinance, but addressing the harms created by redlining and segregation and disinvestment really requires every tool that we have. This is, we're taking on the zoning code in this ordinance, but we also are using many, many other tools and approaches in this administration. So a couple examples here.

Many of you have benefited from Invest Southwest and the developments across 10 different communities and comprehensive investments that include economic investments, many of which are near transit. I already mentioned the $1 billion in affordable housing investment, fully half of which, half of the developments were pushed for transit in South and West side communities. On the public transit side, we have lots of work going on to improve better streets for buses, red, purple modernization, and of course the redline extension South.

Lots of work with CDOT on the citywide vision for trails and corridors and capital plan investments. And then lots of work that we have already been doing between the department of planning, department of public health, department of transportation, department of housing. We have co-funded 11 pilot programs near transit and we've committed to a $10 million investment in TOD through the Chicago recovery plan.

So point of this is just to note, yes, we are excited about what's in this particular ordinance, but it is far from the only things that we are doing to make more equitable development near transit possible in this city. Another thing I just wanna note is that we are really not out in front on this issue. This ordinance would bring us in line with many of our peers.

So Atlanta, LA, Minneapolis already define their TOD radius as four blocks from transit, not two blocks as Chicago currently does. Cities like San Francisco, San Diego, LA, and Minneapolis also include high frequency buses as we are proposing to do more of here. And in places like Denver, LA, Minneapolis, Portland, the pedestrian friendly development and the transit oriented investments are mandatory actually rather than optional.

So it's not a nice to have, it is a mandatory feature in those cities. So just to note here that we are catching up and that's exactly what we're working on here in this ordinance. The other thing I wanna note about why the timing is right for this is that earlier this year in May, President Biden and Secretary Buttigieg announced that USDOT will reward jurisdictions that tackle exclusionary zoning and support transit oriented development in their upcoming competitive grants.

One that I really wanna stress is the red line extension, which everyone is focused on ensuring that we secure those dollars and doing the work that we're proposing here will make us more competitive for those federal grants. So before I turn it over to Juan Sebastian to go through more of the ordinance, I wanted to give three examples of how existing TOD incentives have helped spur investment. One is city subsidized new construction, one is market rate and one is a rehab.

The point of all of this is to note that our existing TOD is helping do the work we're talking about. And if we expand, we can do more and more. So the first example here I'll give is the Lucy Gonzalez Parsons Apartments, formerly known as Emmett Street Apartments in Logan Square.

It's a hundred affordable units on a former city owned parking lot, 20 parking spaces. It is on top of the Logan Square Blue Line Station without the TOD parking flexibility that they have, it would cost a minimum of two and a half million more because of the added parking that would be required and the garage that would be needed. That would then shrink the number of units substantially because of the space required and we have less affordable housing in a community that is losing affordability hand over fist.

So the point is this is on top of transit. We think even if it were two and a half blocks from transit, this is the kind of development we wanna see more of. Next example, this is a market rate development in Bronzeville and we think that this is an important example because this is how incentives like this can help make private investment work in a neighborhood where otherwise what we're hearing from developers is if they had had to do the full amount of parking here is likely would not have penciled out.

So it's 49 units, 24 parking spaces, three quarters of a million dollars, we estimate would have cost to add the parking and lose housing units and almost certainly would be infeasible without this kind of flexibility. So here you don't have a city investment of dollars, but you do have regulatory ability to make this private investment work. And the final example I'll give is a rehab and a reuse of existing property, which is also an important component here.

So this is in Pullman, Pullman Artspace Lofts. It was both a rehab and a new construction, 38 affordable units with 17 parking spots. So the estimates here without this flexibility that ETOD gave it, it would cost nearly three quarters of a million more to build the parking.

Again, you'd then reduce the residential units. If both of those things are in play, it substantially decreases project flexibility. I think the main thing that I want to stress here is that the more of this kind of flexibility that we can provide, especially on the South and West side where our margins are the tightest, it gives us more opportunities to bring this kind of development and this kind of investment to communities that need it.

With that, I will turn it over to Juan Sebastian Arias to walk through some specific features of the ordinance.

[Speaker 40] (59:27 - 59:29)
Let me get, all right, thank you, Commissioner.

[Speaker 1] (59:30 - 59:42)
And Juan, in your testimony, would you highlight some of the changes in the substitute just so everyone knows the original and where we're at today? Thanks.

[Speaker 5] (59:43 - 1:09:13)
Yeah, I'll incorporate that as I go through and try to circle back and make sure that I've covered them all. But good morning, all men and women. Again, my name is Juan Sebastian Arias, Deputy Director of Policy in the Mayor's Office.

And I'm going to present an overview of the Connected Communities Ordinance, which has three core goals of growing the economy, improving street safety, and promoting housing affordability. So to start, I'll do a high-level overview, and then I'm gonna go into each pillar in more depth with additional slides. And as I mentioned, the Connected Community Ordinance does three main things.

First, it grows the economy and creates jobs by allowing more homes and businesses to be built near train stations and near bus lines, largely by extending existing transit-oriented development incentives more broadly and equally across the city. Second, it makes streets safer for all Chicagoans who walk, who bike, who roll their wheelchair or ride to transit by ensuring new developments near transit prioritize pedestrian safety. And third, it promotes and protects affordable housing options near transit, including through stronger incentives for affordable housing and protections against the loss of two flats and three flats in neighborhoods with displacement pressures.

Of course, we know that different neighborhoods in Chicago have different needs. And so we also tailored this ordinance to reflect different goals by community types. That means that in disinvested communities, we want to lower the barriers to development and create more opportunities for public and private investments to pencil out.

In higher cost communities, we want to increase affordable housing options. And across the city, we want to have safer streets for all sidewalk users. We'll go into each of these pillars in more detail for the rest of the presentation to review the specific provisions of the ordinance.

But before doing that, I do wanna be clear on what this ordinance does and what it does not do. So starting here on the left, what the ordinance does, it more equitably distributes transit-oriented developments citywide. It allows for community and market to shape parking in new development near transit.

It allows for density bonuses only with council approval, and it reduces costs and improves feasibility for both market-driven and city-supported projects as we've just heard the commissioner go over a few examples of too. What the ordinance does not do is that it does not change the existing aldermanic and city processes for development. It does not circumvent design reviews or allow for larger by-right developments.

It does not remove the ability to provide sufficient parking, and it does not change existing zoning of a parcel. So for example, that means that there's no high density that is gonna be allowed on residential streets through this ordinance where it was not already allowed before. And just to stress this point, this ordinance, again, does not give developers the ability to build anything by-right that doesn't already exist under the current TSL or TOD rules.

So to be able to use the extra floor area, density, or height requires council action today, and under this proposed ordinance, city council and individual council members still have the exact same control. Now, to get into the specific provisions, I'll start with the first goal of growing the economy. So E-TOD is a job creator.

Between 2016 and 2021, approved TOD projects in the city are estimated to have created over 160,000 jobs, more than half of which are permanent jobs as opposed to construction. However, as the commissioner mentioned earlier, only 10% of that investment has gone to the South and West sides. So with connected communities, we're looking to lower the barrier for investment more equitably across the city and begin to make up for these disparities while also supporting job growth.

One of the things that stops us from getting more homes and jobs near transit is parking. What we have seen is that when given the choice, developers will provide adequate parking, but current requirements often call for more than is needed, leaving lots of spaces vacant while increasing costs. A 2016 Center for Neighborhood Technology survey of buildings near CTA stations found that only half of parking spaces that were built were actually being used on average.

So part of what this ordinance does is to right-size parking near transit, which often makes the difference between a deal penciling out or not, as we'll hear more about later. So what specifically does this ordinance do to address this? Here are four key provisions under this first goal.

The first is to extend the existing TOD incentives to a standard four-block walking distance from CTA and Metro rail stations. This is important because, as was noted earlier, current TOD incentives only apply up to two blocks away from transit or up to four blocks if there's a designated pedestrian street. And since only eight out of 47 designated pedestrian streets are in the South or West sides, that means that we're not offering these incentives equally across the city.

A standard four-block radius from train stations is more predictable and more equal no matter what part of the city you're in. The second key provision here is to extend these TOD incentives also to all high-frequency and strategic bus corridors. The last TOD update in 2019 made developments along 10 bus corridors eligible for transit-oriented development.

In the first two and a half years since that update, we've seen 25 bus TOD projects. With this expansion to more bus routes, we're looking to build on that success and especially cover more parts of the city that have less access to train stations. The third provision in this goal would further keep development costs down by setting a limit on how much onsite parking new residential projects can have so that the default is one parking spot per two units with flexibility to go up to one spot per unit through an administrative adjustment.

And last but not least, this ordinance will further extend TOD parking flexibility to more zones. It would lift one-size-fits-all parking mandates on new high-density residential districts near transit so that those developments aren't mandated to build as much costly parking spaces as if they were nowhere near transit. The second goal of the Connected Communities Ordinance is to make our streets safer and easier for all Chicagoans to walk, bike, roll their wheelchairs, or ride to transit and frequent nearby businesses.

Transit is not a real option for people if it isn't safe to access by foot or wheelchair or any of these means. Just in 2021, 83 people died in traffic accidents within walking distance of a train station, while over 1,200 were seriously injured. Traffic violence, as was noted earlier, is also highly inequitable.

Nearly three in four traffic deaths occurred in the South and West sides in 2021. This second set of provisions in this ordinance seeks to address this and make streets safer for all residents who use them to get to the train. And so just to give a little bit more visual, what do we mean by safer streets?

On this slide, you can see the kinds of street designs that we want to discourage through the Connected Communities Ordinance. We wanna protect sidewalk user safety and create more walkable, accessible sidewalks, including by limiting how many times automobiles can interrupt the pedestrian right of way. And on this slide, you can see the kinds of streets we want to proactively encourage through the Connected Communities Ordinance.

These are people-friendly streets with fewer driveways, with parking lots behind buildings, complete streets and street fronts, and other inviting features. What we want to see is more of these streets near train stations across the city. So more specifically, how this ordinance proposes to do this.

The first is to only allow for new curb cuts and driveways within four blocks of rail stations through an administrative adjustment. Safer sidewalks with less interruptions will allow more Chicagoans, especially those that are elderly, youth, people with disabilities, and families with children in strollers to be able to walk to and benefit from transit. The second provision is to apply pedestrian-friendly design standards to new development within four blocks of rail stations, including providing ample sidewalk width, having entrances facing the sidewalk, and prioritizing pedestrian safety in site plan layouts.

Third, the ordinance would establish independent residential bike parking requirements for new development near rail so that adequate bike space is provided for residents in TOD areas. And last, the ordinance would also require larger developments to submit a transportation demand management plan as a part of their overall approval process. And I'm going to actually pass it over to my colleague, Daniel Hertz from the Department of Housing to go over the third goal of the Connected Communities Ordinance.

[Speaker 3] (1:09:13 - 1:12:57)
Thank you, Juan Sebastian. Good morning, members of committee. My name is Daniel K.

Hertz. I am a Director of Policy with the Chicago Department of Housing, here to talk about the third pillar, third goal of the Connected Communities Ordinance, which is more diverse and affordable, as well as accessible housing in every neighborhood, especially near transit. And as we know, this is a paramount need all over the city, but in particular in areas where costs have been rising and where displacement pressure is a major concern.

So if you could move to the next slide and the next. So the goal here is across the city, more diverse and affordable housing, but we do want to emphasize the extent to which we've heard from residents of the city, as well as of course, older men and older women, that there cannot be a one size fits all policy when it comes to housing and affordable housing. And so the Connected Communities Ordinance is tailored in many ways to meet the needs of each type of community across the city.

So in high cost areas, there is a requirement for an up or down vote on developments that have at least 20% affordable housing in high cost areas within as little as 12 months. This is, I'll highlight one of the areas that has changed in the substitute based on feedback from community members, from members of this committee and other older people. The original ordinance allowed an applicant to request a final vote after six months for a total of eight months.

This extends it by four months and also adds a requirement that if an applicant is asking for a final vote, they must show proof that they have held a public meeting to hear input from the community and engage the community around the project. It's really important that this is meant to work with community engagement, with community input. And obviously the final decision still remains with the zoning committee and older people to approve or deny a zoning application.

In gentrifying areas, the next provision is targeted specifically at e-conversions and teardowns of two to four unit buildings. And essentially it will require a zoning change if somebody wants to deconvert a multi-unit building, a single family in an area that is zoned for multifamily already in one of these preservation areas or gentrifying areas where there is already experience or high risk of displacement of low income residents. So we really see this and I've heard from a number of community supporters that this is an important way of putting some brakes on some public oversight on a development type that can remove that two to four unit, two to six unit type rental stock that's so important for naturally occurring affordable housing in many Chicago communities.

[Speaker 1] (1:12:59 - 1:13:02)
And then- So Daniel, Daniel, do you have the map of that please?

[Speaker 3] (1:13:04 - 1:13:20)
So the committee members can see what areas. Yes, we can move to that. Yes, so here it is.

So this would be in the community preservation areas, the areas colored in blue on this map is where that provision would apply.

[Speaker 37] (1:13:20 - 1:13:20)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:13:21 - 1:13:30)
And just in layman's terms, the area in blue is under threat of transformation and or gentrification, however way you feel about that issue.

[Speaker 3] (1:13:31 - 1:13:38)
That's right. These are areas that are at risk or are already experiencing displacement of low income Chicagoans.

[Speaker 1] (1:13:39 - 1:13:44)
Okay, just for the committee members to understand that nuance. Okay, thanks, Daniel.

[Speaker 3] (1:13:44 - 1:14:36)
Thank you, John. Go back. Thank you.

So the rest of the provisions do apply citywide and are again meant to promote affordability and accessibility near transit across the city. So the first here is to take the existing TOD density bonuses and link them more closely to the provision of onsite affordable units. Basically saying, if you want to take advantage of the density bonuses that come with the approval of a plan development or type one zoning change in a TOD area, you must increase the number of onsite units that would be provided higher than what's otherwise required under the ARO.

In addition, there is an allowance to have developments.

[Speaker 40] (1:14:37 - 1:14:39)
Daniel, hold on a second.

[Speaker 1] (1:14:39 - 1:15:02)
I know we're going to have questions, but I've been through this numerous times. So we have a plan development or a type one zoning change and the provision for onsite, the ARO is what's the minimum, give me more specific about what, give me an example, I should say.

[Speaker 3] (1:15:03 - 1:18:49)
Sure. So under the ARO currently, if there's a 20% set aside, which is set aside in most areas in high cost and gentrifying areas, 5% of that 20%, so five, say it's a hundred unit building, five units have to be provided onsite. Another five have to be built, but could be onsite or offsite.

And then the rest of the 10 units could be provided onsite, offsite, or as an in lieu payment. What this ordinance does is basically say, if you want any of the sort of a step up, if you want any of the TOD density bonuses, you must put at least half of those units. So 10 of those units out of 20 onsite.

If you want the full TOD density bonus, you must put all of the affordable units onsite. So all 20. And that link was not as strong previously or is not as strong currently in the existing TOD ordinance.

And that's obviously aimed at improving the equity of TOD development in high cost and gentrifying neighborhoods in particular, but really all over the city. The second piece here is basically recognizing that right now in the zoning code, when a developer development chooses not to build parking, structured parking in a TOD development, they cannot replace that space with anything else. So if you have a five story building and one of those floors is a parking garage and the development decides to remove the parking garage as they're under the TOD ordinance, the building simply gets smaller.

You can't replace that floor with anything else. It goes from five to four. What this would say is, excuse me, you can replace that on a square foot for square foot basis with affordable housing units.

And so again, that would require more onsite affordability. The building does not get any physically larger. It's just replacing square feet that would be used for a parking garage and replacing it with a square footage for affordable housing units.

The third piece here under the citywide provisions is eliminating parking mandates for affordable housing units. This is not to say, as you've seen in some of the examples that Commissioner Navarro gave, that parking would never be provided because we do know that there is often some need for parking in affordable housing, simply that there is flexibility to provide it or not based on local needs. And then finally, there is a small adjustment for buildings that include ground floor accessible units, basically trying to reverse the current incentive, which is to build stairs up to the first floor, which removes the possibility of accessibility for those ground floor units for people with mobility disabilities.

So we see that as another important piece of making housing more accessible to everyone, especially near transit.

[Speaker 2] (1:18:55 - 1:19:16)
Thanks, Daniel. At this point, we want to turn over to Leon Walker with DL3 Realty to just say a few words as a developer on the south side, how these incentives work for him. If Leon is able to...

Available. There you go. Thanks, Leon.

[Speaker 11] (1:19:20 - 1:24:38)
Thank you, Commissioner Navarro, for this opportunity to speak to the council. Chairman Tunney, I am pleased to make this presentation to you and the other committee members in support of this ordinance. I'm gonna focus on...

My name is Leon Walker, before I can jump in. Leon Walker, managing partner of DL3 Realty, a local developer focused on equitable development in our neighborhoods, particularly on the south and west sides. And we are laser focused on bringing quality, job creators, services, and other developments to our communities and have been doing so for 20 years.

And I can speak directly to why this ordinance is needed now at this time and why this would be helpful for our efforts and the efforts of many others who are trying to bring density and better demographics to our communities. I'm one that does not believe in concentrated poverty because that only leads to vulture capitalism. We need to have more diversity of income types and demographics in our neighborhoods.

It doesn't always mean racial diversity, although that can be a part of it, but we need to have different types of people living in our communities so that we can start to bring the retail and services that makes the community sustainable in the future. This ordinance is important because I would like to focus on the first letter E. And that is to make our community equitable.

I think Commissioner Navarro and her team have explained and demonstrated with great clarity that 90% of the focus of the development community has been on the north side and just 10% on the south and west side. This is something that must change as we cannot continue to have a city divided with a small island of prosperity surrounded by a sea of poverty. So the word equitable is meaningful here as it seeks to bring opportunities to neighborhoods that need them the most.

We also, number two, must reduce the headwinds and lower barriers to equitable development moving into our neighborhoods. And this whole ordinance helps promote density and provides a path for lower parking requirements in these developments. And, you know, as they were showing the numbers, you know, yes, it costs more, but another way of understanding when we say it costs more is that there is a barrier being raised to development happening in our neighborhoods.

And we need that development to turn around and bring jobs and opportunities and a better way of life for our neighborhoods. And the third thing I will say is that I think it's really smart. You know, it builds off of our assets and focuses on the assets we still have remaining in our communities, the transit-oriented stations and locations that can be built upon so that we can create a sort of a, some success in those areas, a cluster of success that we can then expand out into the neighborhoods.

This is a way of creating that ripple effect to creating some success that we can build upon to expand out into our neighborhoods. And the last thing I'll just say is that, you know, for me and for many others who we're trying to encourage to get into development, community development in their own communities, this brings a level of certainty. You know, the timelines, the understanding of how a development can be executed in a cost efficient, but yet high quality manner needs to happen.

We need to not frustrate these new entrepreneurs that are rising up in our neighborhoods and are seeking and pursuing opportunities to better not only themselves, but their communities. And in that effort, we have something called the Chicago Emerging Minority Developer Initiative, which myself and two partners have been working for the past two years, and that's C-E-M-D-I dot O-R-G, to lift up developers of color from our communities so that they can, you know, pursue development and do things so we don't have this 90-10 divide that we can start, you know, creating the talent and the experience necessary to develop their own neighborhoods and communities and hopefully make a better Chicago for us all.

So this ordinance is a big step in that direction of supporting our emerging developers. It is a big step in providing certainty for them as they pursue viable projects in the neighborhoods. It helps lower the barriers to those developments moving forward, and it is equitable.

And it focuses on that equality we all want to see across our city.

[Speaker 1] (1:24:38 - 1:25:25)
Thank you, Mr. Walker. Thank you. We've heard loud and clear, not only from you, but many of our public comment speakers echoing the same sentiments.

We're gonna open up from questions, but before we do, we've been joined by Alderman Nugent, Alderman Taylor. I think those are our recent additions. And we also have- Alderman Smith, Tony.

Alderman Michelle Smith. Is there anybody else that's for the call? Please identify.

Okay, so Michelle Smith added. We also have Anna Robles and Patrick Murphy from Zoning for questions any of the committee members have.

[Speaker 2] (1:25:25 - 1:25:34)
So I'm gonna start with Alderman- Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt. We do have Roberto Riquejo and Melvin Thompson to finish out our presentation and then we're done.

[Speaker 1] (1:25:34 - 1:25:44)
Okay, we'll get in one minute each, okay? Okay, we've had enough. I'm sure there'll be reiterating stuff.

So if they would capitalize in a minute each and we'll have the timer on.

[Speaker 47] (1:25:46 - 1:25:47)
All right, let's go.

[Speaker 42] (1:25:47 - 1:27:14)
Thank you, Commissioner and Chairman Taney and members of the Zoning Committee. My name is Roberto Riquejo and I'm the Executive Director of Elevator Chicago. We are a coalition of community-based organizations and partners advancing ETOD in the city.

And we have invested more than $3 million in development near transit in Garfield Park, Chatham, Little Village, Logan Square and many other places. We have been working with the city since 2019 to make sure that the TOD ordinance was equitable. In 2019, we asked the mayor's office to co-convene with us an ETOD working group including neighborhood-based organizations, experts in transportation, public health, climate change, racial equity and artists.

City departments and transit agencies were also at the table. Together we built a plan. The plan took 18 months of work during a pandemic including workshops for 80 plus people and more than 300 people commented on the plan.

The plan was downloaded 1,800 times in six languages and 66 formal comments were submitted. The plan included 30 plus recommendations as described earlier today and to ensure that the new ordinance responded to these three demands, we met with the city as an ETOD working group four more times to vet the provisions proposed in the ordinance. We kept working with the city in between meetings and we co-sponsored a health and racial equity impact assessment with CDPH.

The ordinance that you have in front of you is the product of this long- Okay, we need to conclude.

[Speaker 1] (1:27:14 - 1:27:27)
Our next speaker, our next speaker, please. Thank you. And try to be, if there's something innovative or new that hasn't been brought in front of the committee, I'd appreciate it.

[Speaker 43] (1:27:28 - 1:28:53)
Yes, okay. Good afternoon, Chairman Tittani. My name is Melvin Thompson.

I'm the Executive Director of the Andaleo Institute. We are representing the Washington Heights community on West 95th Street. We are in great support of this communities connected ordinance.

On the ground, we have a brand new transit station. We had the fortune of having a $300 million investment and the misfortune of having nothing built around this. This ordinance is an ironclad statement to our community.

We have an $800,000 planning grant from the federal government that stretches two miles between 95th and Cottage Grove to 95th and Halsted. It touches five different communities, Washington Heights, Roseland, Chatham, Burnside, and Calumet Heights. An ordinance of this magnitude will connect these communities.

We have Chicago State University. We have the transit station. We have a rejuvenized and renovated Woodson Library.

All we need to do is connect the dots. This ordinance is really a statement that defers to community. And we can contour this and make 95th Street.

Okay, thank you, Roberto.

[Speaker 1] (1:28:54 - 1:29:11)
That's the end of the testimony. I do appreciate all the witnesses. However, we spent over an hour just on the presentation.

So I wanna be respectful, make sure that our committee members are engaged and their questions are answered and we can move with Alderman Rod Sawyer first.

[Speaker 39] (1:29:12 - 1:29:40)
Thank you, Chairman. Very quickly, I know a lot of my colleagues have questions and I am generally supportive of the issue of equitable development on areas that sustain transit corridors. But a couple of quick questions.

One of the last speakers talked about as a citywide initiative, the TOD benefits would only be for those affordable that are onsite, is that correct?

[Speaker 2] (1:29:44 - 1:29:49)
Alderman, there's a specific provision that Daniel Hertz was referring to.

[Speaker 50] (1:29:50 - 1:29:50)
Yes.

[Speaker 2] (1:29:50 - 1:30:12)
And that's in an instance where you have an ARO development. So a trigger of the Affordable Requirements Ordinance, then you get certain density provisions with a certain amount of affordable onsite. You get more if you do the full 20% onsite.

So it's specific to a development that is subject to the ARO.

[Speaker 39] (1:30:13 - 1:31:03)
Okay, so it's only those that are subject to the ARO. Right. All right.

Now, my more general question is, and I guess I don't know if this can be answered. And this is my number one concern. Will the approval of this ordinance really result in more development in affected communities?

I have areas that I've been working on for the last 12 years almost, trying to get somebody to pay attention to vacant swaths of land that are adjacent to transit lines. So I guess, I know it's a big question, although it's very simple, but I know it's a part of a bigger issue. Will this result in more development?

Because I do not wanna pass something. And then when all of us are trying to attempt to get something done in affected communities, nothing happens.

[Speaker 2] (1:31:04 - 1:33:01)
Sure, Alderman. I absolutely understand the question. And what I'll do and answer is to both put it in history and then talk about going forward.

I do think it's important to note that the bus transit options have only been in effect since 2019. And in fact, in your ward, it was two buses, 69th and 79th Street. Under the new ordinance, that would expand substantially, 71st, 75th, 87th, Halstead State, King Drive, Cottage Grove.

What we're hearing, you heard a little bit from Leon Walker, we heard earlier today from Charlton Hamer and Phil Beckham. What we're hearing from our development partners that are actually delivering on the South and West side is that the more areas that are eligible for this kind of development, the more chance that these very difficult deals will get done. You know this very well.

There's lots of reasons why a particular plot of land may not work out. It might be hard to acquire. It might have contamination.

There might be lots of reasons why a particular site doesn't work. The more opportunities we open up, especially in areas where it's hard to get these deals done and the margins are really tight, the more we feel we can get done. So that's one thing, is just to note the opening up of opportunity.

We see that as only a good thing. I don't see the negative to that. The other thing I'll say is that as an administration, since 2019, we have a track record of really showing our commitment to this.

And you see that in the 12 investments that we're making through our last funding round. You see that in the money that we have set aside through the community recovery plan for ETOD. You see that in the approach that we're taking within Best Southwest.

So I think between all of that, you can rest assured that this is the approach that we're taking going forward.

[Speaker 39] (1:33:02 - 1:33:41)
Thank you for that. And I'll just say this in closing. I just wanna make sure that whatever we're doing, we're doing correctly.

I did question earlier the expeditious nature of this ordinance proposal. It's going pretty fast. And for something so important, and I believe that's so important, I just wanna make sure we measure twice and cut once.

So let's make sure that we do this deliberately and make sure that we have all the right answers to everyone that's on the call today, because I know there are a lot of concerns and I just wanna make sure that we're careful about this. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:33:42 - 1:33:58)
Thank you, Alderman Sawyer. And this is not the first bite of the apple at TOD. So we're gonna probably learn from this even if it is passed today.

Alderman David Moore had his hand up next.

[Speaker 12] (1:33:59 - 1:37:33)
Thank you, Chairman. First of all, I'm gonna make this statement as a question at the end of this statement, Chairman. So I heard redlining.

I heard the red light extension. I heard disinvestment. And everything that I've heard is the poster child for what the Englewood community is.

In the past, transit oriented development that we've passed has not impacted communities like Englewood. It was mentioned organizations who support this ordinance and one such organization was RAGE, Resident Association of Greater Englewood. There's two members of that organization that come to mind.

Tina Hammond, who's the block club president on the 6800 block of Palina, who have taken a city vacant lot and transferred it into a community space that is the envy of Chicago to make her community look better. Another member of RAGE is a young lady by the name of Michelle Rashad, who is the block club president of 6800 block of Wood, who is also the director of Imagine Englewood If, an organization that helps bring resources to the community, but not always development resources because that's not her wheelhouse, but one that she advocates for. Both of these leaders live in the 69th street corridor bus route that connects to a red line between Ashland and Damon.

There are over 30 contiguous vacant lots on this site of which 70% are city owned vacant lots. Not since Alderman Terry Peterson back in 1999 and completed I believe under Latasha Thomas in 2000 has any kind of development was done in this area. And that was a much needed shopping mall with the grocery store.

So for now for 22 years, no housing development or other development has been done in this community. I am supporting this ordinance because I have asked and I expect this corridor to be a priority. I purposely doing our remap session, kept this community area in my ward because sometimes community areas over the years have gotten passed around the challenging community areas and the tough community areas people run from.

That's what I run to because I do not want it to come for another 10, 15 years that there's no development here. So now my question, how realistically and this is to Commissioner Navarro, how realistically and passing this ordinance that in a three to five year period that some type of potential development could be done over in that community. And I say three to five years because within three to five years, it'd be close to 30 years.

Let me hear that. Let me say that again. 30 years since there has been any development and there's what is called the poster child for everything that we just talked about.

So what's the realistic? That's my question.

[Speaker 1] (1:37:34 - 1:37:36)
Okay, Commissioner Navarro on the question.

[Speaker 2] (1:37:37 - 1:38:38)
Yes, Alderman Moore, I would say, you can look to the process that you've gone through in Auburn Gresham. And I know that's not the community you're talking about, but if you look at the way that the Department of Planning and Development and the Department of Housing has worked with you to develop vacant land in that community, we can sit down and plan to sit down and do the exact same thing. And we have been in touch with Sean on your team for those follow-up meetings, in fact, to continue with those conversations.

And that's what I would really offer to everyone here. I mean, that is the point of the neighborhood planners in the planning department is let's sit down and look at the opportunities. And if this ordinance passes, what opportunities does it open up that may not have been there before?

And how do we then go out and proactively go after it? So absolutely, we've conveyed this to you in an ongoing manner. You have our commitment to sit down with you and continue to work on that.

[Speaker 1] (1:38:40 - 1:38:44)
Thank you, thank you, Chairman. Thank you. Alderman Mike Rodriguez.

[Speaker 28] (1:38:46 - 1:38:48)
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I hope you can hear me okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:38:50 - 1:38:52)
We can, Mike, continue.

[Speaker 28] (1:38:52 - 1:41:10)
Very good, thank you. I just rise to be associated with this excellent endeavor and ordinance. First and foremost, I wanna congratulate the mayor's office, particularly those at the Department of Housing, Juan Sebastián, Daniel Hertz, Commissioner Navarro for the very skillful engagement of aldermen, all the persons, but then also the community and the significant inputs and formation of this ordinance that Elevate Chicago has put together.

I've heard from members like the ARP and many others about this endeavor. And the fact is, is that I can't remember a piece of legislation that combines public safety with affordable housing, creating density and safer communities in such a comprehensive package. It's not everything that I was hoping for in this endeavor, but that's the way this goes.

We compromise and we come together. And as long as we can still stand proud about a piece of legislation, we may cause and help it pass. And that's what I've done so far.

And I count on this passing. I urge my colleagues to vote A on this effort, which will make our city more attractive to both working class individuals, but also to investors and people who are looking to invest in our city, people who are looking to live in our city, to be able to live in our city in an affordable way, but then also to create a safer city. It's at the forefront of what we do.

Public safety is not just violence prevention and intervention, but it's also being proactive in creating a safer community for our seniors, for our disabled communities, but for all of our residents. This is that rare package that both keeps our city safer, makes our city safer, but then also much more attractive to working class people who are looking for affordability and developers as well, who are looking for incentives to create affordability. So I'm proud to stand with this package, be one of the co-sponsors, and I urge favorable consideration by our membership.

Thank you, Mr. Chair, for the ability to speak here.

[Speaker 1] (1:41:11 - 1:41:32)
Thank you very much. And again, we have a lot of speakers. So if people have questions, please let's get a question out.

Obviously there's a lot of positive feedback, but I also wanna make sure that any of the older persons have questions about the ordinance or the substitute. So I'll move on with all the woman Patel.

[Speaker 7] (1:41:33 - 1:45:16)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First off, I wanna say that I've been a supporter of transit oriented development for a long time. I think commission tomorrow, you'll know before, remember before you became a commissioner, I was focused on the 43rd and Calumet area near the 43rd street Greenline station.

So, you know, I'm a proponent of the concept. I think, you know, and the fact that one of my projects is a poster child for ETOD now is a good thing. But, you know, I believe that incentives only go so far.

And when I think of incentives to go back to a question that Alderman Sawyer asked about, what good would this ordinance do? I think it is important that we really put the focus the political will and the finances behind our ability to make these kinds of deep investments and communities on the South and West side. So to me, this ordinance is nothing.

If we aren't gonna put some meat on the bones, it will be go to the wayside just like the empowerment zones and the enterprise zones and our communities on the South and West side. So I just wanted to add that. I walked into this meeting, not sure how I'm going to, you know, whether I could be a supporter of this ordinance a lot or not, primarily because I have some concerns about the treatment of our historic boulevards.

Our boulevards are yes on the national register, all 26 miles of our boulevards, all 19 of the boulevards within the city of Chicago, but we have really no protections for those streets, which in my opinion, don't fit the strategic bus corridor streets that have been discussed in this ordinance. So what I would like to ask is if the commissioner would be willing to create a work group, you know, time limited, small work group of Alderman who may be impacted by boulevards or have these historic boulevards in their community. So we could look at closely, I mean, this is moving real fast.

We need to look more closely, I think, to the potential impacts or the unintentional impacts that this ordinance might have on the boulevard system. And so I wanna pose that as a question, whether or not there's a willingness on the part of DPD to put such a work group together post this consideration of this ordinance. I think the second question I have relates to the administrative adjustments on the driveways on residential streets.

So this ordinance, you know, takes in two to four blocks of area around these transit locations. And I have a lot of developers who are now trying to put curb cuts, driveway cuts on residential streets instead of using our traditional alley access. And so I wondered if someone could speak to the potential that this ordinance would have on creating more curb cuts in residential streets, which I don't want to see.

[Speaker 1] (1:45:17 - 1:45:31)
All right. So in the presentation, I mean, we have Anna and Patrick, but in the presentation, if my memory serves me correct, they would be allowed under administrative adjustment. I think Patrick or Anna, can you confirm that?

[Speaker 7] (1:45:32 - 1:45:51)
Yes. Sometimes we don't get all that information from CDOT on a timely fashion. I would like to see, you know, I want to make sure that I'm not going to have all of these curb cuts.

[Speaker 1] (1:45:52 - 1:45:58)
All right. Do we have a CDOT rep on the call? Bill Higgins.

[Speaker 41] (1:46:02 - 1:46:03)
Hi there, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:46:04 - 1:46:08)
Hi, Bill. Did you hear the question from Alderwoman Dowell?

[Speaker 16] (1:46:09 - 1:46:15)
If I'm understanding correctly, is the question whether or not curb cuts would be allowed in the Boulevard?

[Speaker 7] (1:46:16 - 1:46:29)
Could you just briefly describe the process for administrative adjustment on curb cuts now? And does that change with this ordinance?

[Speaker 10] (1:46:30 - 1:46:36)
Well, I would actually defer to Patrick Murphy at zoning because the administrative adjustment goes through them.

[Speaker 41] (1:46:36 - 1:46:54)
They're the ones that make that adjustment and allow the curb cut. We permit, we issue the permits for any curb cuts that are allowed, but under this ordinance, when administrative adjustment would be required, they would have to go through zoning to get that adjustment.

[Speaker 7] (1:46:55 - 1:47:17)
And the reason I ask this is because we used to sign off on those sheets that we received when there was a driveway permit, but since 2019 or 2020, we have not signed off on these. So I want some protection for my neighborhood.

[Speaker 10] (1:47:20 - 1:47:47)
Right, I understand. Patrick, would you like to speak on the administrative adjustment process? Sure, that's fine.

Chairman Alderman, the administrative adjustment process that exists now is not proposed to be changed under this ordinance. So there is a notification requirement that exists for the local aldermen and the adjacent property owners, and that would remain, it would remain enforced as it is today.

[Speaker 7] (1:47:49 - 1:47:50)
All right, I see.

[Speaker 1] (1:47:50 - 1:47:57)
Yeah, well, it sounds like Chairman Dow, you know, the issue is we used to sign off.

[Speaker 7] (1:47:57 - 1:47:58)
Yeah, that's the problem.

[Speaker 1] (1:47:59 - 1:48:04)
And now we get notice, but it might not, it might unfortunately fall through the cracks.

[Speaker 7] (1:48:05 - 1:48:07)
Right, sometimes it falls through the cracks.

[Speaker 10] (1:48:08 - 1:48:31)
If I could just add, the process from the zoning standpoint hasn't changed under this administration. How it is handled once it's authorized through an adjustment, I couldn't speak to what those differences might be, but the actual text and the process related from a zoning standpoint has not changed as far as aldermanic awareness. All right.

[Speaker 7] (1:48:32 - 1:48:42)
All right, I don't wanna beat this dead horse, but Chairman Tunney, can I get an answer to my question about creating a small work group? Yes. Whether or not there's a commitment to that or no.

[Speaker 1] (1:48:43 - 1:48:51)
All right, that question was Navarro. Commissioner Navarro, did you hear the request Alderman Dowell is making?

[Speaker 2] (1:48:52 - 1:49:24)
Absolutely, yes, Chairman Dowell. We'd be happy to sit down with you and others who also have boulevards and want to examine that. I think we, you know, we would bring in folks from, that you've been working with in DPD on historic preservation and various things, and we can look specifically at that issue.

What I would ask is that because there are over a dozen measures in this ordinance, we would like to proceed with it as a whole, and we can always do a trailer if there's something that comes out of that process.

[Speaker 7] (1:49:24 - 1:49:32)
No, I'm agreeing with that, Commissioner. That's how I can get to a yes. I can't get to a yes if there's no commitment to this issue.

[Speaker 2] (1:49:33 - 1:49:34)
Yeah, I have my commitment.

[Speaker 7] (1:49:34 - 1:49:35)
All right, thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:49:36 - 1:49:39)
And it was also a time-sensitive commitment, if I'm not mistaken.

[Speaker 7] (1:49:40 - 1:49:40)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (1:49:41 - 1:50:02)
All right. Again, we've got a lot of items on the agenda. I actually have a five o'clock this evening.

I want to make sure I can make it. So please, let's get some pertinent questions. I know we have some co-sponsors that are here to speak on it.

So let's try to be a little quicker. All right, Alderman Siccio-Lopez.

[Speaker 17] (1:50:03 - 1:51:11)
Thank you, Chairman, and thank you again for the Commissioner and healthcare team for bringing this conversation. And let me just start by saying that I also like to join in support of this effort. Just a few questions that are important.

Just to clarify, in communities like ours, where we have the anti-deconversion demolition fees, I know that we've done this around the 606 and in Pilsen. Can you explain a little bit in more detail? Because I know that it is in the presentation there was discussion around preventing displacement.

How does the density bonus works in order to this exchange of density for affordability, specifically in these areas where we already have the anti-deconversion and demolition fees, but likely we're going to see an incentive, and this is an incentive for development. So how do we make these work, right, with these policies in place to have this trade-off of affordability for density? Again, I hear Alderman Dowell and some of the concerns.

So what are those provisions? If you can walk us through that a little bit more in detail.

[Speaker 2] (1:51:16 - 1:51:33)
Daniel, can you take this on? And just to clarify, Alderman, are you talking about the deconversion provisions specifically that apply in preservation areas, or are you talking about the ARO provisions or both?

[Speaker 17] (1:51:34 - 1:51:44)
I would say both. In particular, in the North Ward, I think is the ones that we already have in place, but I think it would be pertinent because this is a citywide issue. So if you can do both, that would be great.

[Speaker 3] (1:51:46 - 1:54:06)
Yes, absolutely. Thank you, Alderman. So really two pieces I think I'm hearing here.

One, obviously, is this anti-deconversion piece, which, as you mentioned, was really piloted in the Pilsen area and in the 606 area. The idea here is simply that in these areas that are experiencing or vulnerable to displacement pressures, and that are already today zoned for multifamily buildings, if someone wants to take that multifamily building and deconvert it, do a gut rehab, or do a teardown and build a new structure that's a single-family home, that has to go through a zoning process in the same way that any increase in density compared to what's allowed now would have to go through a zoning process. So it doesn't say it can't happen. It merely says that there's an extra layer of public review and review by this committee and by council before that can happen.

And of course, that really goes to the value that those sort of small-scale two- to four-flat, two- to six-flat-type buildings provide in terms of naturally occurring, so-called low and moderate cost housing, unsubsidized in communities like yours and in many others around the city. The other piece I think I heard you ask about is around the sort of the density bonuses that have been tied to affordability. Just want to emphasize again, those only apply when the ARO has been triggered, meaning when there's been a zoning map amendment or a plan development approved by council.

And really what those do is they just more tightly link, we want to see more homes and businesses near transit, but we also want to see more affordable homes in particular. And so those provisions simply say, again, if you're going to take advantage of those bonuses, the bar is higher in terms of the number of affordable units provided on site. And so that's really one of the key ways we see this as more tightly linking equitable development with transit-oriented development.

[Speaker 17] (1:54:09 - 1:55:51)
Thank you. And one follow-up question, Chairman. I know I want to get to at least two questions.

The follow-up is important around this board. I think it's good that we have local, I think a local robust process to review these. I think it's healthy.

And I see the provision to vote on items within 12 months. I think that one of the things I'd like to ask is that we, I mean, and I perhaps add myself into this working group to discuss the community engagement process and how this connects to quality of life plans and other provisions that are very locally driven. Again, the concern is when we have a citywide policy and then, you know, the concern around gentrifying areas.

I hear a lot of emphasis on that, but however, not a lot of protections, especially as we define affordability. The community meetings are how the community can advocate for that is critical. So in that sense, I want to make sure I know that it gets triggered with ARO, but again, in order for us, I think to have more public meetings and more consistency across the board, I think that we have to look through that and how it connects to local quality of life plans and really redefining affordability.

My concern right now is that a lot of these incentives are putting in the market incentives for them to define affordability. Developers are not going to make this very affordable because profitability is in front of affordability. My question in this line is, how can we provide more incentives that are in line with local quality of lives?

I hear some of the concerns. How do we make these pushes from the community? I get some provisions are there, but I would like to see how much more can we do to make affordability instead of profitability the goal here.

[Speaker 1] (1:55:54 - 1:55:56)
All right, who's going to answer that one?

[Speaker 17] (1:55:58 - 1:55:59)
Well, I can start.

[Speaker 2] (1:55:59 - 1:56:42)
I think Alderman, one thing to keep in mind is that the, as an example on the ARO triggers, you only get the additional density if you're doing more affordability. So that's exactly what you're asking for is what we are doing. And so there's a calculation made on the part of the developer, of course.

What we have found for the most part is that more density makes it worth doing more affordability on the development side. And so we each get what we want out of that trade-off. So that's an example where we are saying in order for you to get more of what you want, we need more of the public benefit of the affordability.

[Speaker 17] (1:56:42 - 1:57:22)
And so that's what we're proposing today would exactly do. Yeah, thank you again. These are minimum requirements and I look forward to see, I hope that as other colleagues said, if we can have a working group, I think refining affordability and some protections in gentrifying areas is still a work in progress.

So I hope to get a commissioner to perhaps set up this working group and see how it works in some of our communities that the incentives, I think, will bring development. Now we wanna make sure that we have conscious development and developers have a track record of doing the minimum, not really working with communities. So I'd love to work with you on a working group to look at this.

I think it's a good first step, but a lot of work to be done.

[Speaker 1] (1:57:23 - 1:57:26)
Thank you, Alderman Siccio-Lopez. Alderman Raymond-Lopez.

[Speaker 8] (1:57:30 - 1:58:26)
Good morning, Chairman and members of the committee. Good morning, Commissioner. If I may, I like the idea of expanding transit-oriented development.

I think it gives us a lot of good opportunities to do things. Excuse me. What concerns me though, and what has concerned me with a number of the other ordinances this administration puts out is that it continues to try and force its will on property owners.

This deconversion part of this ordinance, will be the full reason I'm going to vote no against this ordinance. If it wasn't part of this ordinance, I'd be 100% on board. So I actually have one, first off, my first question is, can we separate the two?

So that we can at least move forward in a unified front with the parts of the ordinance that do not include the deconversion piece.

[Speaker 1] (1:58:29 - 1:58:36)
All right. Let me ask either Daniel or Larissa to respond to that. Request.

[Speaker 2] (1:58:38 - 1:59:09)
My response would be that there are many of the aldermen's colleagues who explicitly want this component in, because they have expressed concerns about the kind and the amount of deconversions that they are seeing in their communities. And so, because it applies in the communities where council members are asking for that specifically and have pushed for that, that's what we would like to proceed with.

[Speaker 8] (1:59:10 - 1:59:15)
But this is a citywide policy now, that grown.

[Speaker 2] (1:59:15 - 1:59:21)
No, sir, it applies- No, no, I seen the map, but what I'm saying is- It's not citywide, no.

[Speaker 8] (1:59:21 - 2:00:20)
But again, this is a growing citywide policy that we're lurching towards, which is the ability to tell people what they can or cannot do with their properties. We saw this with the anti-gentrification ordinances, where I believe I said almost the exact same thing then that I'm gonna say today, which is that I have a hard time telling a family member who's owned a two or three flat for 50 years, and have been through neighborhoods good, bad, and ugly, and back to good again, that they are not allowed to deconvert their own property, because it takes away of what you all consider naturally occurring rental units. I think that's grossly unfair to tell that to people who have stuck by neighborhoods through their challenges, and now want, and rightly deserve the opportunity to reap the benefits of their persistence.

[Speaker 1] (2:00:22 - 2:00:38)
Okay, so- Seeing that policy grow- Let me just say, let me just interrupt for one second, just to comment on that. So, Daniel or Marissa, this is not prohibited, but it's the reverse, where you'll have to get the zoning change to deconvert. Is that correct?

[Speaker 2] (2:00:40 - 2:01:03)
Yeah, Daniel, if you can walk through that, and also, I do think it is important to stress again, this is applied in areas where we are seeing a loss of affordable housing already, or is substantially already, or is imminent. It is not a citywide policy, but Daniel, if you can walk through the actual mechanics of it, that would be helpful.

[Speaker 3] (2:01:04 - 2:02:02)
Yeah, absolutely. So again, all this would say is that in these areas, and particularly in areas that are already zoned for multifamily, so this will not change anything in areas that are zoned single family. Single family homes will already be allowed, are today allowed as of right, and would continue to be allowed as of right under this provision of the ordinance.

All that would change is under, in areas that are currently zoned for multifamily, like three flats, or two to four unit buildings, if you wanted to create a single family home, a new single family home out of, either by deconversion, rehab, or by teardown, you would need to get a zoning change to single family zoning to do that, in the same way that you would need a zoning change to build a larger building, so that there would be that piece.

[Speaker 8] (2:02:02 - 2:02:34)
Daniel, I understand that, and Commissioner, I understand what you're saying, but again, we are expanding this policy that started in, I think, four neighborhoods, now to several more, and we're gonna continue expanding until it reaches neighborhoods like mine. I'm in a two flat right now, behind me, which means by right, if I were in one of those areas, I'd have to get zoning approval, and an alderman's approval, to make this, to convert my own two flat into a single family home, correct?

[Speaker 3] (2:02:35 - 2:02:43)
If I were in one of those zones. If you were in a multifamily zone area, yes, that's possible.

[Speaker 8] (2:02:43 - 2:05:03)
So now, the city is gonna hit you on both ends. If you wanna change the zoning up, you have to go through the whole ringer. You wanna change it down, back through the ringer again.

My point is, that you're losing naturally occurring rental units. But if it's my two flat, or my grandmother's two flat, or anyone else's two flat, and they wanna do it, we are taking what has traditionally been their right to deconvert without going through this process away. And now, even in a very hypocritical sense, increasing aldermanic prerogative, because even if they want to, now they have to try and get an alderman to okay it, which will put them at risk of having an alderman who says no, and holding them hostage, aside from the law holding them hostage.

I have serious problems with that. If people have been in a neighborhood, they should have the right to choose whether or not they want to maintain their properties as a two flat, or as a single family home. That is a right that we're taking away from them.

And it's not going to solve the issue of rental affordability, or the number of rental units, because what you're gonna wind up seeing is that people are just not gonna rent. And I think it's a severe and gross overreach, but very consistent for this administration to continue this push. And I wish we were not doing that part.

Expanding opportunities to build developments around public transportation, all for it. But telling owners what they can and can't do, when it's by right in one neighborhood and not by right in another, sets a two tiered standard, which I don't even know how they could justify as being legal, let alone fair and equitable in this city. And I would ask my colleagues to say no to that.

Unless we're able to bifurcate this ordinance, then I'd be all in favor for the first, and we could revisit the second. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 12] (2:05:03 - 2:05:04)
Thank you.

[Speaker 8] (2:05:05 - 2:05:06)
Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 12] (2:05:06 - 2:05:26)
Point of information, please, Chairman. All right, is that David? David Moore?

Yes. Point of information. Yeah, based on what Alderman Lopez has said, and although it would have to go to zoning, that's not additional cost to those homeowners, is it, or is it?

And if so, could that cost be waived?

[Speaker 1] (2:05:29 - 2:05:41)
Well, we have zoning on the call. I'm assuming that it would be a private application and they would have to pay for it. But the question is, is there some kind of a, is there some kind of waiver of that fee?

[Speaker 10] (2:05:43 - 2:05:51)
Chairman, this is Patrick. No, yeah, private application, there is not a waiver of the fee. The map amendment cost and the notice cost would be borne by the private applicant.

[Speaker 1] (2:05:51 - 2:05:59)
All right. All right. David, that's your point of information answered.

Walter Burnett.

[Speaker 15] (2:05:59 - 2:09:44)
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. Of course, I'm a co-sponsor on this.

And I have to tell you all, although I'm a co-sponsor, we went through a couple of renditions on dealing with this. I did make some comments that I thought would be more acceptable to some of us. There was a lot of compromises made.

In the instance where we do have the opportunity for stuff to be administrative adjustment and come back to zoning, is things that allow for the aldermen to still have input if they did or did not agree with some things. But this thing for me is twofold because I have a diverse board. I have the, excuse me.

I have the bustling area where I have a lot of development going on in the West Loop. And of course, all of those folks would love to have not to have to do parking and put in affordable housing, which they're gonna have to put in anyway. But also I have the West End of my ward and in the North side of my ward and some areas where they need more affordable housing and in some areas we can't get development there.

But at the same time, I have a lot of young people moving to the West Loop for work and they can't afford to stay in the area where they're moving to. But they still want to be able to go to work in those areas and be close by because they don't back cars. So what this does is give those young people who they work at Google, work at some of those places in the West Loop, all these companies that's moving down there, it gives them an opportunity to move further West, close to transit and get an affordable place to live.

And also give developers an opportunity to have someone that could potentially move into their places if they were to build in those areas on the West side and the South side. So this is the first time that I've been involved in an ordinance that has affordable housing and where I have a group of developers that want it, right? Usually you just have advocates that want it.

In this instance, you have advocates and you have developers. This is a win-win situation. I've had advocates to come to me to support it.

And I also have had developers to come to me to support it. Matter of fact, Leon Walker took me to lunch to talk about this because he thought it was so great for developers like himself to be able to build on the South side or the West side. So I think what this does is gives the city and other folks throughout the city the opportunity to capitalize on a lot of the emerging businesses that are moving to the central area, give them opportunity to capitalize on some of their employees moving to their community.

But at the same time, get these developers an opportunity to be able to develop in those communities and have an audience that would potentially want to move in those areas. Because all these young people don't like to drive. They like to ride bikes.

They like to take the train. They don't want to buy cars. I had my son, even, I offered him a car when he graduated from college.

He said, dad, I don't want a car. A lot of these young people do not want cars today. So I'm in my conversation.

I see you turning, you want me to hurry up and stop.

[Speaker 1] (2:09:44 - 2:09:48)
But I support this. I've got a five o'clock appointment. That's what I'm worried about.

[Speaker 15] (2:09:48 - 2:09:59)
I got it. I support this and I think this is a good, and it gives us, it still gives us a lot of opportunity to either accept some things and change some things.

[Speaker 36] (2:09:59 - 2:10:00)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:10:00 - 2:10:07)
Thank you, Alderman Burnett, for your leadership on the issue. Alderman Kappelman, quickly, James.

[Speaker 36] (2:10:08 - 2:11:42)
Yes, thank you. I wholeheartedly support this ordinance. And July, 1972, 50 years ago, I moved to my first apartment, had a part-time job working at produce department of the grocery store.

Where I was also working full-time to pay my college tuition. One 10th of my entire income from my part-time job paid my rent. So today we have people working full-time and they're paying 50 to 60% of their entire income for rent and people in SSI, due to a disability who can't get into government restricted housing, they're paying upwards of 90% of their income on rent.

So I fully understand that all wards are very different and the talent to cities as still exists and we'll be here for a while. Right now, I have a large number of apartment buildings that are 95% occupied. And we have some buildings where there's a waiting list because there are 100% occupied.

The problem with extremely low vacancy rates is that this has increased the demand for housing. And it's this increased demand that's causing our rents from our naturally occurring affordable housing to soar as they respond to this high demand. This ordinance will help us meet that high demand for more housing, which will help prevent displacement of our residents with low incomes.

So no ordinance is perfect. Alderman Ray Lopez made some great history points that need to be heard, but I fully support this because of the critical need this city is facing and the rest of this country. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:11:42 - 2:11:46)
Thank you, James. Alderman Michelle Smith.

[Speaker 20] (2:11:51 - 2:12:42)
Thank you. I only have one question. I only have one question, which is I need to understand exactly how the provision for forcing a vote on a plan development application would work.

Because it says that if something isn't voted on 300 days, that, and then if it doesn't go to the zoning administrator in my community, it will be considered passed. So I need to know the details that would trigger that requirement.

[Speaker 1] (2:12:42 - 2:12:48)
All right. So is Patrick on a call? They wanna answer Michelle Smith's process question.

[Speaker 10] (2:12:49 - 2:14:06)
Sure, hi. Thank you, Chairman. Thanks, Alderman.

So the crux of how that process or that extra language would work is contingent first on the application falling into the new definition that's included in this ordinance regarding the affordability. So provided an application meets that criteria, then the applicant can seek the vote before the committee, including with that responsibility with that request is the notice that comes to the local alderman and a community meeting that must be held. So that requirement may not have been satisfied in the initial community process that an alderman and an applicant have for a project.

So that may require a new community meeting. And once the notice is satisfied, once the request has been made by the applicant and they've followed through on the process, then they can request that vote. And if that is not satisfied within the 300 days that are now included, there is a 60 day window in which it could be automatically sent from committee to the full council.

[Speaker 20] (2:14:07 - 2:14:56)
So again, I don't mean- I hear you, Patrick. Now tell me what exactly has to be in that inclusionary application for it to fall within what you are telling me is a small exception. So tell me what does- I understand the affordability has to be on site.

Does it have to be in the very same building? Because of course you're talking about a high-rise here. Or can it be on a subsidiary building on the same site?

Okay, I- Like a landmark building. Can you take a landmark piece of property and turn it into affordable housing and build a high-rise? Is that something that, you know, and build a high-rise next door?

Can you, when we redid the coven, for example, you know, we're building an apartment behind it. Would they have been able to say that these are the affordable housing and force the vote for a bigger high-rise?

[Speaker 10] (2:14:57 - 2:15:12)
Okay, let me ask Daniel if he could possibly respond to how the affordability would or should be required or how it has to be satisfied. There is a definition. I'll just say there's a definition in the middle of page 26 of the ordinance.

[Speaker 17] (2:15:13 - 2:15:14)
I'm looking at it.

[Speaker 10] (2:15:14 - 2:15:29)
Right, okay, the inclusionary application. It then references back criteria that falls under the ARO ordinance. So if Daniel, if you could, you know, fill in for the alderman and the committee, what the, like how that would work as far as the delivery of units.

[Speaker 3] (2:15:31 - 2:15:47)
Yes, so it would need, the units would need to be considered on site, which generally means they need to be in the physical same building, not nearby. If they are not in the same building, then that is generally considered an offsite project, which would not qualify.

[Speaker 20] (2:15:47 - 2:16:39)
What if they're on the same property of the planned development, but in another building? If you're speaking of the specific case of the Covent, I- No, no, I'm just giving an example, or there are other examples in which developers wish to build luxury housing, but they don't want to put the affordable housing directly on site. It's across the street.

It's on the same, it's on, it's a bigger parcel and they put a little, they put a building next to it. They want to do that and they want to be able, and I want to know if that's allowed because I'm very uncomfortable with that, because that's not- My understanding is that generally we have considered that offsite housing. No, I want to know before I vote whether you can promise that will only apply to units that are in the same building.

[Speaker 2] (2:16:44 - 2:16:49)
We could double check on that, ultimately, for your vote tomorrow.

[Speaker 20] (2:16:50 - 2:17:52)
That needs to be public, because I found myself agreeing with several of my colleagues who said developers, with all due respect, are motivated by profitability, not by affordability. And if they can find a way to shoehorn in some affordable housing in exchange for something extravagant that hurts the community, I'm concerned that you're going to force that down people's throats. When we negotiate with developers all the time, all the downtown aldermen in the inclusionary area spend a lot of time negotiating with developers to get better developments, whether it's landscaping or how you approach parking and driveways and pedestrian improvements.

We spend a lot of time, these are multi, multimillion dollar developments that often do take more than a year. And I'm very concerned that because you think that this is such a CY problem, that this is going to create bigger problems. And I remain very, very concerned about that.

[Speaker 2] (2:17:53 - 2:18:36)
Sure, we can double check on that. We generally, aldermen, it's been extremely rare that we have had a developer propose to do a completely separate building that is considered part of their overall development. Generally, it is either in the building or it is further off site somewhere else.

And therefore it's a very clear distinction. And we can check on that before you have a vote tomorrow. I think the thing that overall we want to stress here is that the point of this measure is simply that proposals are brought to a vote.

[Speaker 20] (2:18:36 - 2:18:56)
I appreciate that you and I have had a conversation about it. I just want to make sure others understand that that's what this measure is. Thank you, I want to revisit the conversation.

It's not, I disagree with the word, simply getting a vote. It's really about community development. So, all right, thank you very much.

That's the only question I have, thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:18:56 - 2:19:25)
All right, and just for, if my memory serves me correct, not in Alderman Smith's ward, but I think Atrium Village where they built, they put all the affordable in the renovated six-story building and all the market rate went in the four or five towers around there. So I think that might be a credible example. So let's put that in the mix, all right?

[Speaker 15] (2:19:25 - 2:19:36)
No, you're wrong, Mr. Chairman. All right, well, yes, you're wrong. So correct me, Walter, I'm sorry.

Yeah, they also put affordable in the market rate buildings too.

[Speaker 1] (2:19:36 - 2:19:43)
Okay, okay, I remember that it might've been a second phase to that one. Okay, point taken.

[Speaker 16] (2:19:44 - 2:19:45)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:19:45 - 2:19:46)
Alderman Osterman.

[Speaker 16] (2:19:47 - 2:20:32)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will ask a question. First, I want to say thank you to you for your shepherding this through and getting a lot of questions answered.

I want to thank Commissioner Navarro and her team and DPD and everyone. My question is to Patrick Murphy or Commissioner Navarro, in relation to when a development is happening and someone wants to, I'll say, trade parking for affordable units, what will that process look like or how will that go? Because I think a lot of times, I think as Alderman Smith had said, that a lot of that happens on the community side or the aldermanic side, but moving forward, how will that, what will the process be so that we're clear on that?

[Speaker 10] (2:20:34 - 2:22:04)
Commissioner, would you like me to handle the zoning first and you guys do the affordability portion? Sure. Okay, so Alderman, the, well, first of all, every project that would come through with that potential benefit would be subject to a planned development.

So it would have to trigger a planned development under the current rules that exist today. It would then have to fully maximize whatever its available development rights are, and then it would be able to trade off square footage for square footage of parking spaces for square footage for affordable units. And so the public process that would take place would be in line with the planned development process that goes through normally in a community.

It would take the same process through city council, committee on zoning, plan commission, et cetera. The ultimate negotiation of what that square footage that formerly would have been for parking would manifest itself under affordability would be a separate discussion with the Department of Housing, much like a lot of affordability requirements are now triggered when a PD is established. And like Daniel had mentioned before, the overall bulk and massing of the building, the idea behind this ordinance is that the physical structure stays the same.

It's just now you're converting certain spaces that were for automobiles for additional affordable housing. And then how that is quantified both in percentage and number of units, I'll turn over to the commissioner and Daniel.

[Speaker 16] (2:22:04 - 2:23:00)
Let me, if I could stick with you on this one, I wanna lay a hypothetical and then I'll ask Commissioner Navarro to answer. If there are developments that are by right, they have, they're within a proximity of a TOD and by right, they are able to build a certain massing of building and take advantage of TOD. It might understand you that if they were to want to trade off housing, affordable housing for parking, that would then shift into a by right development into a plan development.

And if that's the case, it's the follow-up question, would that then trigger the higher threshold for percentage of affordable units? Okay, let's do it in two portions.

[Speaker 10] (2:23:01 - 2:23:40)
If a project today or even in the future, if this certain clause is approved, is able to be established absent hitting a plan development trigger. So it does not achieve the quantity of units or the height or any other trigger that exists today. Then they would not be eligible for this clause and it is not an automatic PD clause.

Like for instance, if I'm a downtown project, okay, fine. So there is no PD trigger that is created through this ordinance. It simply says, if you're going to be able to take advantage of this, you first have to be a plan development.

[Speaker 16] (2:23:41 - 2:24:00)
I got it, okay. That answers that question and I'll cut, for brevity sake, I got it. I'll follow up if needed, but if the commissioner wanted to follow up and just, this is for myself and others that have these developments wanting to make sure that we're doing things the right way and can direct people on how that would work.

[Speaker 2] (2:24:03 - 2:24:06)
Yeah, Chairman, is there a remaining question?

[Speaker 16] (2:24:07 - 2:24:23)
Just the process-wise. So I think if it goes through the plan development, is that something that your office will look at and work with us in our communities to kind of make sure that the balance of the affordable versus the parking is something that everyone is comfortable with?

[Speaker 2] (2:24:23 - 2:24:26)
Yes, absolutely. That's the process we envision.

[Speaker 16] (2:24:27 - 2:26:23)
Okay, just a quick comment. I support this ordinance. I am a strong supporter of transit-orientated development in my community.

It's been transformative. It will be in the future. I think the real thing for me, and this is as a housing chairman and seeing our city is how is this gonna impact the South and West sides to grow market rate development in affordable units that will tie to businesses and jobs moving forward.

And I think that Commissioner Navarro has done a great job with DPD and housing to really help lift up and support new housing on the South and West sides. But the key thing is that it has to be sustainable. And I think Alderman Dow talked about putting meat on the bones and Alderman Moore talked about 30 years.

I think as we get to the budget process for the city, trying to make sure that there is a point person within the city that is the point person for ETOD. So that Alderman, developers, community know who to talk to about specifics on a project. The other part is to put real money and towards some of these developments that will be sustainable.

And the last thing is coordination. I think that there needs to be coordination between housing, planning, CDOT, CTA, which I think has not been part of this conversation today, but they're gonna be integral in that and they need to be at the table. And the last thing is with the members of the city council because all of us know our communities and all of us wanna grow housing in our communities.

That doesn't happen in a vacuum. And if we can do that together, then a few years down the road, we're gonna see real progress in our community and our city in a very equitable way. So I think that this ordinance is a good step.

We have to follow it up with real measures and funding to go along with it. So thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:26:23 - 2:26:33)
Thank you, Alderman Matt Martin. And by the way, Alderman Gil Villegas is added to the quorum call. Alderman Martin, please.

[Speaker 31] (2:26:34 - 2:28:27)
Thank you, Chairman. I have one, I think it's a comment because I don't see anyone from CTA here. I understand that one of our colleagues, Alderman Ramirez Rosa had introduced a resolution that many folks are supportive of to have CTA explain their plan.

And I understand that there was an op-ed written last week mentioning that they understand the concerns, but the T in ETOD is obviously transit. And to not have someone from CTA here today or to have that hearing scheduled to talk about what their plan is, not just to get back to where they were from a service standpoint pre-pandemic, but to get to a point where we can see reliable bus transit that's gonna support what's in here, I think is a real mistake. And so I'd strongly urge CTA officials to make sure that as Alderman Osterman said, that they are really coming to the table and telling folks, not just that they're working hard because that of course is happening, but to explain exactly where service is right now, what an appropriate bus frequency and rail frequency is, how many operators, how many vehicles we're short to achieve that and what their exact plan is, including a timeline.

Without those specifics, I very much worry that we're just gonna be treading water and that we're going to as Aldermanic offices continue to get lots of questions and concerns about a lack of transit access to support where we are heading, not just in the coming years, but in the coming decades. So I just, I wanted to make that concern public and I very much hope that CTA steps up to the plate and in a transparent and timely fashion, explains exactly how we're gonna get to a place to support the ordinance that looks like it's gonna be passed. So that is all I have.

Chairman, thank you for the time.

[Speaker 1] (2:28:27 - 2:28:28)
Thank you, Matt.

[Speaker 2] (2:28:28 - 2:28:31)
Chairman, could I just say a word to that quickly?

[Speaker 31] (2:28:31 - 2:28:32)
Quickly.

[Speaker 2] (2:28:32 - 2:29:28)
Sure. I mean, I certainly understand those concerns, Alderman. I took the blue line to City Hall this morning as I do almost every day.

I think we all experience CTA together as we all ride it. And I can't speak for President Carter. I can say that we are coordinating together closely on many developments, including the red line extension, which goes across basically every department we have on that work.

And I will say that I think in a case like this, we've gotta be able to do two things simultaneously. CTA can be and say that they are working diligently to improve frequency. And at the same time, we can be proactively seeking development near transit that better connects people to jobs and their homes and services that they need.

And we can and we have to do both of those things at the same time.

[Speaker 31] (2:29:28 - 2:29:59)
Yeah, and by no mean am I implying that we should not move forward with this or that we should slow things down. I think to your point, we need to have CTA work in tandem. And what I'm not seeing publicly is an explanation of like their hard work is going to get us to a specific place.

Like we need to be more than working just hard. We need to be working smartly and to be working backwards from clear goals that I don't see right now. So I just wanna make that clear.

[Speaker 40] (2:30:00 - 2:30:34)
All right, Alderwoman Carrie Austin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. To Commissioner Navarro, as you have stated, this does not adversely affect single family housing, but I have a development which will be coming in the future as you are aware with the red line.

How would this affect those new housing, which I believe will be two flats, three flats such as this?

[Speaker 2] (2:30:36 - 2:31:44)
So that's actually one of the things I think is most exciting about where we're at right now with transit is that for the first time in a very long time, we have the opportunity to be proactive about development near potential new stations. And so we actually already are doing that across multiple departments with planning, with CDOT, with us, with housing. We have been in conversation.

I know some of those conversations have been with you and with CTA around what is the most appropriate use for land around the proposed new stations. We certainly are looking at the possibility of dense multifamily housing right next to the station. And we certainly think that as you move out blocks from there, that two and three flats and then eventually single family homes become a lot of the fabric that we expect to see in those areas.

But our proactive approach on that is absolutely to say, let's put a pin where we expect those stations and then be proactive about development that is dense, that reduces the parking and brings the affordability that we need.

[Speaker 40] (2:31:45 - 2:32:48)
Okay. Thank you, Commissioner for that explanation because I know that I wouldn't have been able to do a good job as you just did. Because along that route of the red line in its future, there will be retail housing such as that.

And that's a large stretch of land that will affect. So that's the reason why I'm trying to see if this will affect that future building. And if it will affect that future building where I have my hesitation.

But if it will not, if it will be added into the development, then I'm okay. But if not, then I have a problem with it because some of the housings along there may want to convert. And will they be affected by it?

So the deconversion components of this ordinance would not be in effect in your ward. Okay.

[Speaker 2] (2:32:48 - 2:33:35)
What would be in effect in your ward would be that the four blocks surrounding these new red line stations would be eligible for the incentives that we're talking about. And the other thing I realized I've sort of been saying shorthand, dense affordable housing. In most cases, what we're also talking about and what's really crucial in neighborhoods that have long been starved for investment is that the first floor is commercial as well.

It's not residential. And in many cases, we're writing down those rents. So we make sure that those are available for local vendors and that we're providing the kind of commercial amenities on the first floor that people want and need.

So that's really what this ordinance would do in your ward with the red line extension.

[Speaker 40] (2:33:35 - 2:33:39)
Okay, real good, real good. That's real good. Thank you, Commissioner.

[Speaker 1] (2:33:39 - 2:33:48)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. And my last alder person is Alderman Wagesbeck.

[Speaker 19] (2:33:48 - 2:35:29)
Thanks chairman, I'll be quick. I appreciate all the conversation with our colleagues and I appreciate the substitute, especially as you chairman and Alderman Smith worked on over the last few weeks. And I think there's some conflicts still on this ordinance.

I think there were some of them that we could have knocked out early on had they come to Alderman and spoken to us about some of these issues, but I'm glad it's working out the way it is. One of the questions Alderman Smith was speaking to about offsite affordable housing. Will this change any of the existing PDs in a way that would put some of the affordable housing back on site to some of these locations?

For instance, Lathrop homes, as a lot of you know, we went from hundreds of units of affordable to a third, a third, a third, the place is still not finished. And what we saw was offsite affordable housing put, and I'll tell you where it is. It's at Diversity Endowment right near my office.

And we saw offsite affordable housing put at 1900 West of Vaughan to satisfy the requirements, 2600 Harlem. I mean, that's basically six miles away, even seven miles away. So are we gonna see changes to those developments?

And are we gonna see something similar on some of these new developments where we could experience the same thing? Or are we really talking about putting the affordable housing on site?

[Speaker 2] (2:35:32 - 2:36:00)
So I think the distinction I would draw here, and then Daniel, it looks like you had some to add to. The distinction I would draw here, Alderman, is that when you're referring to the plan for transformation and the, or sorry, the plan forward now, and the offsite units that are replacement units, right, that were allowed under Lathrop and so on, that's a totally separate category than what we're talking about in this ordinance, which is-

[Speaker 19] (2:36:00 - 2:36:10)
No, I understand that, but what I'm, yeah, what I'm saying is, are we gonna go back and modify that?

Because we're basically creating one system for one group of developers and another system for another.

[Speaker 2] (2:36:11 - 2:36:39)
Well, I think we, it is a separate system because it is public housing. It is fundamentally a separate system with separate agreements that are governed by HUD and not by the city, whereas the ARO is a city-specific ordinance, as you know. So they are already separate systems and would remain that way because we don't govern HUD, we don't govern CHA in the same way because they report to HUD.

[Speaker 19] (2:36:40 - 2:38:09)
Well, I think that kind of brings up my other point about sister agencies, and Alderman Martin already kind of touched on it with the CTA. For years now, I've been waiting for the CTA to get off their butts to help with the affordable housing that I've talked to you about, in particular on Kedzie. And it's been a cone of silence until maybe just recently.

But I would just also add on, Chairman, that CTA needs to get their act together. It is absolutely abysmal. And I'm not saying that they should have shown up here today and explained what they're doing, but if they're gonna be part of ETOD, they need to get their butts to the table because it's abysmal behavior by an organization that we're essentially funding year in, year out, and coming back to us for more.

And it's Alderman who bear all of the discussion with neighbors, all of the discussion with people out there. And frankly, it's just beyond frustrating to not have them here to talk about this and be part of the discussion. So I would say that if we're gonna move further on these, they have to be at the table on every one of these.

And I mean, people high enough up that are making the decisions instead of dragging this out and making us wait going on years for either projects to develop or to provide input on this. So other than that, I do support this. I appreciate the substitute.

And thank you, Chairman, that's all I had.

[Speaker 1] (2:38:10 - 2:38:25)
Thank you, Alderman. I'm gonna ask Alderman Hopkins, and then I know David Moore has a point of information, but I'll start with Hopkins since he has not spoken today yet. Brian.

[Speaker 4] (2:38:25 - 2:39:00)
Thank you, Chairman Toney. My question is regarding the drafting of the assortments as you prepared it and you included the provision to force a vote basically under certain conditions. Was there any part of the existing Chicago City Code anywhere that you were able to draw upon as a precedent for compelling a committee action and compelling a vote within the deadline?

Did you use anything for a model or is this the first time that we're in fact embarking on such a rule change?

[Speaker 1] (2:39:04 - 2:39:07)
Patrick, do you wanna answer Alderman Hopkins' question?

[Speaker 10] (2:39:10 - 2:39:41)
Speaking strictly from the zoning standpoint, no, there is not a mandatory text of this nature. The text was modeled on language that exists today where currently it calls for action. This now pushes for a final action, which is a vote.

As to whether that corresponds to anything else in the municipal code, I would really have to defer to the law department for like a wider response.

[Speaker 40] (2:39:42 - 2:39:43)
All right.

[Speaker 4] (2:39:44 - 2:41:11)
I'm not sure anyone from laws on the call. I can tell you my cursory review didn't reveal any. There may be some that I'm not aware of, but it's unfortunate that this provision is in there.

I am in full support of the outstanding work that went into the ETOD provisions here. I don't know why you would include this poison pill. It's just, it's so objectionable.

It is not a precedent that we wanna set. It is not a responsible way to govern. And I don't wanna start opening the door where committees of this city council will be forced to take votes on an artificial timeframe that's mandated as a matter of rule rather than our own procedures, which is we decide, when we wanna vote on something, when we wanna amend it, when we wanna change it and under what circumstances.

I agree with my colleague who suggested that this is going to give additional leverage to developers when they're seeking to do work in wars like the one I represent. We need all the leverage we can get already to try and affect positive changes that the community can live with. We don't need these sort of artificial mandates layered on top of the work we do.

It makes our job much harder. And frankly, I don't know why it has to be in this ordinance. It's unfortunate that it's in there.

I'd like to support this ordinance. There's so much in here that's good. As long as this provision is in there, I cannot support it and I'm going to be a no vote on this.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:41:12 - 2:41:21)
All right. Again, Alderman Riley, since he hasn't spoken yet and then I'll ask for a conclusion with Alderman David Moore.

[Speaker 9] (2:41:22 - 2:42:56)
Thank you, Chairman. Thank you, Chairman. I hadn't planned on speaking today.

And frankly, I told you even before the meeting started, I was solidly undecided on the ordinance. And I think there are a lot of really good things in here and they incorporate a lot of the transit oriented development practices that a number of my downtown colleagues already employ when we're negotiating complex PVs. And so, I'd encourage any alderman to do that extra work and negotiate those benefits.

And certainly this is a great framework. But to Alderman Hopkins' point, this would be precedent setting. And again, while I think I understand the motive of that provision requiring a vote within 12 months, to previous speaker's point, less scrupulous developers who don't want to engage with the community and negotiate public benefits can simply use this mechanism to run out the clock knowing they're gonna get a vote.

And my guess is this will lead to a proliferation of zoning lobbyists who will be hired to lobby our colleagues on this committee to essentially screw communities represented by aldermen who oppose certain developments. And so, that's the only real issue here. And were that removed from this ordinance, I'd vote for it today.

But to me, that is entirely objectionable. And sadly, that means I have to vote against an ordinance that I think has a lot of really good things in it. So I'll be recording myself as a no vote as well, Chairman, thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:42:57 - 2:42:58)
All right. Okay.

[Speaker 7] (2:43:00 - 2:43:00)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:43:02 - 2:43:10)
Alderman David Moore, your hand is still up for conclusion or point of information or a second question, third question.

[Speaker 2] (2:43:10 - 2:43:18)
Actually, before we go to that, I'm sorry, Chairman, we do have a precedent that we wanted to share to answer the alderman's question.

[Speaker 1] (2:43:19 - 2:43:19)
All right.

[Speaker 3] (2:43:20 - 2:44:23)
Thank you. Commissioner Navarro. Thank you, Commissioner.

This is Daniel Hertz from the Department of Housing. Yeah, we did raise this question with the Department of Law. They identified two provisions with similar sort of timelines that are established, one in 2-185-020 regarding acceptance or rejection of bids for land sales, in which if no action is taken by committee within a 60-day period, a highest bid is deemed recommended and is reported out.

And then 2-120-825 permits for demolition of landmarks. Similarly, if there's no decision by the city council within a certain period of time, the landmark commission recommendation is deemed accepted. So those are two precedents that we had identified in the code currently for that.

Okay. All right.

[Speaker 1] (2:44:23 - 2:44:29)
So we have law on Mr. Siegel. Is there anything new you want to add to that?

[Speaker 44] (2:44:31 - 2:45:13)
Mark Siegel from the Department of Law. I just want to add that that is correct. There's also, I don't know if you mentioned this section, 2-120-705 that gives a one year timeframe for when the recommendation is filed with the city council or it can automatically be passed.

I'll also note that in the ordinance that's before you, the automatic passage we're referring to is an automatic committee passage. So the city council would still have the opportunity to vote, the full city council would still have the opportunity to vote up or down on any item that's quote unquote automatically passed through that mechanism.

[Speaker 40] (2:45:16 - 2:45:17)
Okay. David Moore.

[Speaker 12] (2:45:24 - 2:45:25)
Chairman, can you hear me?

[Speaker 40] (2:45:26 - 2:45:27)
We can, David.

[Speaker 12] (2:45:27 - 2:45:57)
Okay, thanks. So this is off of my point of information that I asked under Lopez and it was answered. Now I have to ask a question to that.

Under the assessor, long-term homeowners of 15 years or more get a long-term homeowners exemption. Could we, if it was a long-term homeowners, waive any additional fees for them doing a conversion? Can we include that so that we're not putting the burden on long-term homeowners?

[Speaker 1] (2:46:03 - 2:46:14)
I'm not sure that's gonna be part of our zoning ordinance. That's gonna be a separate issue. Commissioner Navarro, I see your hand or your motion on that one.

[Speaker 2] (2:46:14 - 2:47:02)
Yeah, I agree with you, Chairman. And I guess I would say Alderman that, you know, it is already the case that what we're referring to here is allowed in a lopsided fashion. So someone has to apply to add density and has to pay whatever it is that, you know, we're talking about would apply here.

All we're doing here is making this a whole and saying that actually there have been real negatives in communities to deconverting and becoming less dense. And so, and the same type of view is warranted. It's the same, you know, it's already allowed on one side.

We're simply saying there's been negatives to that and we wanna even that out.

[Speaker 12] (2:47:05 - 2:47:12)
Okay, yeah, I just don't want home, long-term homeowners to be burdened with additional costs. That's all I'm trying to take away.

[Speaker 1] (2:47:14 - 2:47:24)
Thank you, David. All right, more questions, comments? If not, can I get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call?

Roll call vote, please, Chairman.

[Speaker 34] (2:47:25 - 2:47:27)
Okay. Rodriguez moves to pass.

[Speaker 1] (2:47:27 - 2:47:52)
Okay, Rodriguez on the motion, Brendan on the roll call. So we'll do the roll. All right, obviously voting yes is in support of the ordinance as written with the substitute and obviously voting no is not approving it.

So we'll start with vice-chairman Ravoyas. Aye. Aye, Alderman Hopkins.

[Speaker 50] (2:47:53 - 2:47:53)
No. No.

[Speaker 1] (2:47:54 - 2:47:56)
Alderman Pat Dowell.

[Speaker 7] (2:47:58 - 2:47:59)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (2:48:00 - 2:48:07)
Alderman Sawyer. Aye. Alderman Beall.

[Speaker 50] (2:48:07 - 2:48:08)
No.

[Speaker 1] (2:48:10 - 2:48:16)
Alderman Raymond Lopez. Original Lopez votes no. Alderman David Moore.

[Speaker 12] (2:48:17 - 2:48:18)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (2:48:19 - 2:51:10)
Alderman Mike Rodriguez. Aye. Alderman Sicho Lopez.

Aye. Alderman Burnett. Aye.

Alderman Cardona. Alderman Wagesvac. Aye.

Alderman Austin. Aye. Alderman Villegas.

Aye. Alderman Riley. No.

Alderman Capelman. Aye. Alderman Osterman.

Aye. All right, Alderwoman Hatton. Aye.

Chairman Tony is an aye. Alderman Cardona is an aye. Alderman Cardona is an aye.

All right, so the ayes have it 15 to four. This will be reported out at tomorrow's city council meeting and I wanna thank everyone for their patience and time well spent. You know, this is an elaborate ordinance.

And again, I think just like with TOD in the beginning, I think we went back twice, you know, over the years, this might even be the third bite at the apple. So, you know, obviously we've got an issue on the South and West sides with expansion of opportunities for affordability and density. So let's hope that we can really translate this into some real equitable development on the South and West side.

All right. Now we're moving on to, and after we hear from the building on the heating ordinance, basically, I'm gonna take a five minute break, but we're gonna hear the ordinance document number 02022-1752, the amendment of municipal code section 14X-8-1. 02022-1752 by modifying heating requirements for dwelling and sleeping units.

The item has a substitute. All members of the sub of the committee should have received a copy of the substitute electronically. And at this time, I would ask for a motion to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Alderman Roboyes makes the motion to accept the substitute. Any objections? And hearing none, the substitute is before us.

Let's see. We have our sponsoring Alderwoman Maria Hadden here to present. And I believe our Department of Buildings is on the call too.

All right. Alderwoman Hadden.

[Speaker 14] (2:51:12 - 2:53:43)
Thank you, Chair. And thanks colleagues. So what you've got before you in this substitute is not new language.

So if you all remember last month, we presented to you one ordinance that had combined changes to cooling and heating guidelines through the Department of Buildings. So what was presented on last month, we had some great discussion. We had a couple of colleagues express some concerns and desire to have some more time to look over the heating portion of the amendments.

So we separated it out. We passed the cooling ordinance and then passed it in council. So I did follow up with Department of Buildings, our chairman's team, Alderman Hopkins, Alderman Riley, Alderman Lopez, folks who had expressed the desire to have some more time.

We did meet with buildings. Alderman Hopkins had some concerns met. We had some next steps.

I don't know, Alderman Hopkins, if your concerns were fully met. I know that I reached out a couple of times. And so hopefully we'll hear from you today because I didn't hear back from you over the last couple of weeks, but with no changes recommended and feeling like we might've had concerns met, what you'll have before you today that I'm asking for your support on are the same language that we had in committee last month.

And the last thing I'll say before passing it to the chairman to pass to buildings is that last month when you guys asked us to split this for a little bit more time, which I do think was worthwhile, we did talk about how it wasn't as urgent. The cooling amendments pieces were, but how we had time for heating season. And I just want to impress upon my colleagues that our time is up.

We need to pass this this month in July as we are not meeting in August and heating season begins in September. So if we don't pass the changes this month, we will not be providing adequate timing for our building owners and managers to make adjustments if we have to wait to pass something into September. So I appreciate folks' favorable support.

I appreciate folks' engagement on this last month in committee and then in the time in between. And thank you chairman for the time. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:53:44 - 2:53:52)
Thank you, Alderman for your leadership on this issue. I have Alderman Hopkins' hands is up. Brian.

[Speaker 4] (2:53:53 - 2:56:18)
Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman. So my question is for Commissioner Bourdais the existing language that we're looking at, particularly the language that I think is very helpful and I support where it says, this section does not prevent an owner from disengaging heating equipment or engaging cooling equipment between set dates. And that is the crux of my objection is for these defined dual pipe buildings where the building owners feel that they can't make a decision regarding when to disable the heat and engage the cooling in May and to do the opposite in October.

They feel as we know, and in some cases with tragic results, many of them believe that the decision is made for them and that they must keep the heat on until June 1st, even if they don't want to. And so to put that language in there is appropriate to make it clear that it is not our intention to prevent the owner from making that decision to shut off the heat sometime in May prior to June 1st. The problem is the next part of the sentence where it says, as long as the required minimum temperature is maintained, and the minimum temperature in this case now is going to be 64 degrees.

So I'll give you a specific example. The owner of a dual pipe building makes a decision due to a weather forecast that says there's going to be a heat wave in May and they decide on May 15th that they're going to disengage the boiler, shut off the heat and convert the system to cooling. So they go about doing that.

Based on the language here, they would be within their right to do that. However, five days later, we have unseasonably cold weather returns and the overnight temperature drops down to 59 degrees on May, say 20th. Not out of the question, not even unanticipated.

Now they're required to maintain that minimum heat. How are they going to do that with the heat off? All right.

It's a question for the building commission.

[Speaker 1] (2:56:18 - 2:56:29)
Yes. Commissioner Bode, you've heard the question. It's not the first time you've heard this question.

So for the benefit of the committee, would you please answer Alderman Hopkins' issue, especially on these dual pipe buildings?

[Speaker 32] (2:56:30 - 2:57:17)
Sure. Thank you for the record, Matt Bode, building commissioner. As you know, there's no perfect solution to this.

So there are two pipe systems in a lot of these buildings. I've lived in them myself. And the heat is either on or off.

It can be switched over multiple times. That is a cost to the building owner. But the city would still need to have a minimum heat requirement.

We just can't turn that off and ignore it. So this gives a little bit more flexibility to those owners where we're actually lowering the heat temperature to 64 degrees based on World Health Organization data. But to say that there is no requirement at all, that's not something that I believe we as a city could do.

Great.

[Speaker 1] (2:57:18 - 2:57:19)
Alderman Hopkins, that response.

[Speaker 4] (2:57:19 - 3:00:43)
Yeah, well, but that's currently the practice. And that was another revelation during our briefing discussion, commissioner, where I indicated my personal knowledge of numerous dual pipe buildings who have been violating the strict requirements of this ordinance to maintain minimum heat in the month of May, because they choose to exercise their own pragmatic common sense and good judgment and to convert their system sometime prior to June 1st, taking a chance that no one from the city is going to knock on their door and say, hey, the ordinance says you gotta maintain minimum heat to June 1st.

You flipped the switch and turned it from heat to cool on May 15th, and now here we are again, in my example, sometime late May when there's a few days of cooler weather and you're violating the ordinance. So they're taking a chance and they're doing it because they're trying to keep their residents' comfort in mind over the terms of the rigidity of this ordinance. We talked about that and you acknowledge, you're aware of that.

You know that a substantial number of buildings with the dual pipe system feel they're unable to comply with this ordinance. And your response to that was that your department is not using draconian enforcement measures on those buildings during the month of May. You're basically sort of looking the other way, knowing that these buildings are technically in violation of the ordinance, but you're choosing, and again, I commended you for this in the call, you're choosing not to penalize them for that.

So to summarize, we have an ordinance that is not being complied with for the most part by a subset of the buildings that it's targeted to. And we have an enforcement agency that's intentionally not enforcing the provisions of this ordinance in the month of May. I mean, I cannot think of a stronger reason to change the ordinance.

You know, it's not working from both directions. So for you to tell me today that you don't think it's possible for us to not have a minimum heat measure in the month of May, when in fact, that's what the real world conditions on the ground are. The buildings aren't complying with it and your agency isn't enforcing it.

We need to change it. Let's codify the reality. Let's recognize what is actually happening.

Buildings need that flexibility in the month of May and then from September 15th to October 15th to use their own judgment, what date they need to flip the switch. And to your point that they could easily, you know, flip it multiple times, again, that's not necessarily impossible from an engineering standpoint, but it's difficult, potentially expensive. And some of the buildings tell me, not all of them, you know, have the same limitation, but some of them tell me it takes three days for their system.

I think one to two is the average. Some of the systems, for whatever reason, the chief engineer of the building feels it takes three days to fully convert from heat to cold and back from cold to heat. So they can't do it.

You know, in May, when the weather changes rapidly and unpredictably, it might be 80 degrees one day and it might be, you know, 50 degrees three days later. These buildings simply cannot keep up because of the limitations of their old dual pipe system.

[Speaker 15] (3:00:43 - 3:00:50)
So we need to recognize that. We need to understand that. We need to allow them the flexibility.

[Speaker 1] (3:00:51 - 3:01:33)
Brian, you've made your point many times. This is not the first time the commissioner has heard this. So the response is, and I'm not gonna put words in your mouth, but from our knowledge is there needs to be guardrails, you know, in terms of a city having to have some guidelines, you know, to certainly go after the egregious actors.

So am I wrong with that statement, commissioner? And, you know, I know maybe Maria Haddon has her hand up too, but isn't that the response to Alderman Hopkins' criticism of not enforcing what's on the books?

[Speaker 32] (3:01:34 - 3:01:43)
Yeah, you're correct, Chairman. We do have to have some guardrails and there does have to be some statutory dates and some statutory temperatures.

[Speaker 1] (3:01:44 - 3:01:53)
All right, Alderwoman Haddon, you wanna comment and respond to Alderman Hopkins and or the commissioner?

[Speaker 14] (3:01:54 - 3:03:58)
Absolutely. Again, I'll say, Alderman Hopkins, I appreciate the real world situations, right, that you kind of have brought from the perspective of, you know, someone who's been on the condo board making decisions around, you know, when to turn on the heat, right? And those two pipe systems.

And there are a lot of complex decisions that people have to make. I know that in our follow-up meeting, Department of Buildings and the commissioners made clear, we have to have some guidelines and that I was heartened to hear, and it's great to see in practice that these are the guidelines by which the department and the inspectors use to not overly penalize people who are making their best decisions. But I wanna remind our colleagues and everyone that we're working to fit ordinances, right, to protect the safety of our residents and to make sure that we're giving residents the health and safety protections that they need and that we're elected by our constituents, these individuals who these codes are meant to serve and protect.

And that's kind of the primary focus. Nothing's going to fit perfectly. That's why we're able to amend codes.

I would again ask for, I guess, chairman, if you're gonna entertain a motion, I would really ask that we move forward and pass this knowing that we've had a month for my colleagues to present alternatives. I've spoken to folks from the realtors organizations, from BOMA, no one's come up with alternatives. No one's got some other language that they want to see.

So I think this is a great step forward to give more clarity in knowing that we've got more time. And if folks wanna dig into it a bit more and see how this works for could be amended, we've got the opportunity as legislators to do that. So would appreciate us being able to move forward if possible at this time.

[Speaker 1] (3:03:58 - 3:04:09)
I appreciate your patience and we will entertain that motion. I do wanna hear from Alderman Riley, Alderman Kappelman, and then I'll entertain the motion. Alderman Riley.

[Speaker 9] (3:04:10 - 3:04:34)
Thank you, chairman. I actually, I have a question that's probably most appropriate for the commissioner of buildings. And I don't need a precise number, but on average, how many violations does the department issue for violating these provisions of the code related to the heating provisions?

[Speaker 32] (3:04:36 - 3:04:52)
I can get those numbers for you. You know, obviously our biggest time is December and January. It's the front end of the tail end.

They're very, very few and far between. Okay. The bulk of it is in our winter months.

[Speaker 9] (3:04:52 - 3:05:11)
Okay. And, but, you know, and again, I'm not gonna hold you to a specific number. Could you give me kind of a, just a kind of broad range?

Are we talking about 50 violations annually for these, for these, or are we talking about 200? I just wanted to get a sense of scale as far as how pervasive the issue is.

[Speaker 32] (3:05:14 - 3:05:22)
I'm looking it up now for a ballpark. If I could get back to you on that, I'll get back to you during the hearing. I just want to get you a good ballpark from our last budget hearing.

I've got those numbers.

[Speaker 9] (3:05:23 - 3:06:49)
All right. I appreciate that. And, you know, I think, you know, obviously Altman Hopkins and I represent very similar housing stock.

You know, it's vertical, it's high rise, and we have a lot of aging building systems with the twin pipe. And I, like Altman Hopkins, I've spoken to a lot of building engineers too. And look, I completely understand the city needs guardrails.

You know, we had a really well-intended ordinance years ago that was passed before I joined the council regarding life safety evaluations for buildings. And, you know, that was prompted also by a tragedy that occurred in the loop. We had facades literally falling on people and killing them.

And there are a lot of good things that came with that ordinance too. But, you know, the unintended consequence was that it saddled a lot of condos with unanticipated costs and a real heck of a time trying to comply. And so I know this is, you know, not that.

And I know that's certainly not the intent here, but I guess what assurance, because I certainly want to support an ordinance that keeps our buildings safe for residents. I guess what assurances could I give to condo associations that I represent downtown that the city won't be out there playing gotcha and whacking them over the head indiscriminately, because obviously, especially in this economy, no one can afford additional costs right now.

[Speaker 32] (3:06:50 - 3:06:55)
Sure, so I found those numbers. We responded to about 3,000 no heat complaints last year.

[Speaker 9] (3:06:57 - 3:06:59)
And how many citations did you issue?

[Speaker 32] (3:06:59 - 3:07:16)
I'd have to get the citations. It's, you know, a lot of times it's the heat's back on, and, you know, we do tell folks to work with the landlords first before calling us, because a lot of times it could be resolved easily that way. But, you know, I can get the number of cases filed.

[Speaker 9] (3:07:17 - 3:08:11)
Okay, and I guess, Commissioner, actually, you know, I could probably make it a little bit easier of a task. I'd rather narrow it down to high-rise buildings, you know, multi-unit buildings. I understand that, you know, there are landlords out there with a two-flat or a three-flat that are, you know, messing around with their tenants, and that's one thing.

That's certainly bad, too. But I'd be concerned. I'd rather hear more about, I guess, the twin-pipe buildings.

So that might narrow your universe down quite a bit. But that would be appreciated. Thank you.

If you could get that to me and my colleagues for the chair, that'd be helpful. Yes. And then to my question, as far as what assurances can I give to condo residents who are kind of struggling with this conundrum of this heating issue, when to flip over or not, that they're not just gonna get, you know, bopped over the head routinely by the city?

[Speaker 32] (3:08:12 - 3:08:55)
Yeah, and that's a great question. Thank you for that. Because we always do exercise, you know, our judgment and discretion and good common sense.

So, you know, it's almost like, you know, do you get a ticket for going 57 on the Kennedy? Usually not. You usually gotta be flying pretty fast.

And the same here, when you're really, when you're walking in and it's dangerously cold, or your entire system has been blown out, that's when we really, you know, bring the hammer down to make the repairs done. Also, if there's any children or seniors involved, that obviously escalates the matter.

[Speaker 9] (3:08:55 - 3:09:53)
Understood. Mike, look, every member of the council wants to make sure we're keeping everyone safe. But I would, it would be helpful to me just to, if you could provide that data through the chair.

You know, I will go along with the committee vote today, but depending on what I see in the data, I'll have to withhold my council support until I'm able to review that. But I think it's, I'm okay with proceeding with this. But again, you know, big caveat, that if we find the city is disproportionately enforcing this against these two-pipe system buildings, we may need to come back and amend it, older woman Haddon, because I know that's certainly not your intent.

So I think as long as the guardrails are guardrails and not used to bludgeon our downtown high-rise building owners, I can live with this. So thank you, chairman, for letting me ask my questions.

[Speaker 50] (3:09:53 - 3:09:54)
Thank you.

[Speaker 32] (3:09:55 - 3:10:01)
Just to reiterate, I mean, the front and the tail end of the season is really not where you see a lot of violations and tickets.

[Speaker 1] (3:10:02 - 3:10:04)
Point taken. Alderman Kappelman.

[Speaker 36] (3:10:04 - 3:10:37)
Thank you. I just have a quick question, maybe from the law department. The strict liability clause.

I know the buildings department can use their judgment, but the strict liability clause in the RLTO does not allow for a judgment. And a lot of attorneys use this to get lots of money. So would the strict liability clause be enacted should a landlord choose to turn off the heat May 15th and then a code bill happens and they must turn on the heat again?

[Speaker 44] (3:10:43 - 3:10:52)
Hi, Alderman. Mark Siegel from the law department here. I think prosecutorial discretion is always going to be an option in a case like this.

[Speaker 36] (3:10:52 - 3:10:56)
It's not an option with RLTO, the strict liability clause.

[Speaker 44] (3:10:57 - 3:11:25)
The strict liability usually refers to the mental state that's required for the violation, meaning it doesn't have to be negligent or it doesn't have to be reckless or something like that. But there's still going to be prosecuted. Prosecutors can still use prosecutorial discretion if they feel that this isn't an item we're moving forward, that is productive or the issue can be resolved in a different way.

[Speaker 36] (3:11:26 - 3:11:27)
All right, thank you.

[Speaker 44] (3:11:27 - 3:11:28)
All right. Of course.

[Speaker 1] (3:11:29 - 3:11:35)
I did see... Mike Rodriguez is up.

[Speaker 28] (3:11:37 - 3:11:55)
Yeah, I just wanted to congratulate Alderman Haddon for continued diligence on these types of matters. And also to the mayor's team, a commissionable day. And I would like to move to pass on this item, Mr. Chair.

[Speaker 1] (3:11:56 - 3:12:04)
All right, before we entertain the motion, we have for closing thoughts, Alderman Hopkins has his hand up.

[Speaker 4] (3:12:04 - 3:14:57)
Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman. And to answer Alderman Kettleman's question, the answer is yes. I'm personally aware of a number of situations where that has in fact happened.

More for punitive measures against a landlord who was trying to act in good faith, but couldn't meet the temperature minimums for reasons beyond their control. So yes, it does happen. And I did actually have what I felt were some good suggestions and some good alternatives that I presented in our discussion with the department previously, and they were rejected.

They were rejected as non-workable. So here we are. Once again, I don't see how the minimum here to meet requirements in the shoulder months is being held out into the same sense of urgency that allowed for the fatal accident.

We're talking about it in the same legislative breath and they're entirely different matters. And there's just an assumption in a lot of the discussion here that the building owners of the dual pipe systems are not in fact acting responsibly and acting in good faith. When in my experience, they are.

We need to be allies and we need to support them rather than assume that they need legislative threats in order to do the right thing, which is to protect the comfort of their residents. So now that we have on the record, we have an acknowledgement that they're really not finding and enforcing this law on these buildings during the two shoulder months in the spring and the fall, my suggestion would be that we codify that. We could put in an ordinance that fines and penalties will not be imposed on these buildings during the month of May and during the 30 day period from September 15th to October 30th, if in fact the building is in good working order and they're doing everything else that they should be doing.

And the only reason that they're unable to meet the temperature minimum on a certain day is because they made the decision to convert their system earlier. That would give them the full discretion that they seek and allow them the reassurance that they're not going to be penalized. And when the commissioner comes up with the report that Alderman Riley requested, I believe it's going to confirm what we already know and that we're currently not fining them.

We're currently not penalizing them except in extraordinary cases. So why not codify the practice? Why not recognizing the law, what it is in fact that we are doing?

I would suggest that as an alternative to this, and I think that would satisfy the building owners knowing that they won't be penalized unnecessarily for the crime of having an outdated system that was built in the 60s that unfortunately they have to live with to this day.

[Speaker 1] (3:14:57 - 3:15:04)
Thank you, Brian. All right, Alderman Hadden, are you re-entertaining your motion for passage on this?

[Speaker 14] (3:15:04 - 3:15:06)
Yes, sir, Chairman, thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:15:06 - 3:15:24)
Okay, so Alderman Hadden makes the motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? We have Alderman Hopkins as a no, Alderman Riley as a no.

Is that the will of the committee?

[Speaker 9] (3:15:25 - 3:15:30)
I guess- Chairman, I didn't indicate I'd be voting no.

[Speaker 1] (3:15:30 - 3:17:32)
Oh, I'm sorry. Okay, all right. So, all right.

So there's no ask for a roll call. Okay, so we have moved to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum with the objection of Alderman Brian Hopkins on this item. Anything else?

Any objections, other? Okay, all right. So the item will be reported out with the exception of Alderman Hopkins voting no.

All right, we're gonna move. We've got a couple more things before I need to recess. There, what we're going to do is when it comes to all the private applications, we're gonna take a break before then.

But we do have a direct introduction on the committee. And then we have some, I believe, I believe routine signs on the fact that the one that we deferred on the fourth ward. But let me move to the direct introduction to the committee, a journal correction that supports SO 2022-1111 passed by the committee on June 21st of 2022 for the application number 20992.

And it passed city council on June 22nd of 2022 by replacing the pages that contain inaccurate information. At this time, I would ask for a motion to accept the ordinance by the same roll call that was used- I'll move, Mr. Chairman. Alderman Roboius makes the motion to accept the ordinance.

Any objections to that? No objections? Hearing none, the ordinance is before us.

Now we have Patrick Brutus of the Department of Planning and Development to explain the correction. Mr. Brutus, would you proceed?

[Speaker 33] (3:17:33 - 3:18:20)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In the essence of time, I'll go quickly. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, I'm Patrick Brutus, Southeast Region Planner in the Department of Planning and Development. Also on the call today are my colleagues at the Department of Housing, as well as Graham Grady, attorney representing the applicant and developer. The item before you, as you have stated in your intro, is a direct intro that seeks to correct an ordinance that passed the city council on June 22nd, 2022.

The ordinance that was passed erroneously included incorrect documents for application number 20992. And this ordinance before you replaces the wrong information and includes the corrected pages. Your favorable consideration of this ordinance will be appreciated.

[Speaker 1] (3:18:22 - 3:18:28)
Thank you, Patrick. So in essence, what was wrong with the previously approved zoning?

[Speaker 33] (3:18:28 - 3:18:44)
Yeah, the essential pages that transmitted from the planning commission into the committee on zoning that passed out on city council were basically PD statements, number one and eight, as well as the bulk table. Those are now corrected and they are in the ordinance as committed.

[Speaker 1] (3:18:45 - 3:18:57)
But essentially only two major- But this all passed, the correct information, what passed plan commission, what passed zoning committee that necessitates the reason we're here today?

[Speaker 33] (3:18:58 - 3:19:21)
Yeah, what happened in the planning commission was perfect. What got submitted to the committee on zoning and subsequently passed out of city council, the PD statements were incorrect. The transfer of information was incorrect from plan commission to committee on zoning and city council.

Those now have been corrected, which is the new ordinance here before the committee.

[Speaker 1] (3:19:21 - 3:19:44)
What passed the plan commission was correct. Lost in translation in front of the zoning committee, but fundamentally this was what was passed and what we're going to do is reaffirm the plan commission's positive recommendation on that and it was discussed as such. Was it discussed pretty much with the zoning committee members?

[Speaker 33] (3:19:45 - 3:19:58)
Yes. The bulk table was the same and were there questions asked by the committee members or the local alderman? I don't recall.

I think it was very swiftly passed out of committee last month.

[Speaker 1] (3:20:00 - 3:20:08)
All right. So it's technical in nature. With that, have questions from committee members or non-committee members?

[Speaker 12] (3:20:12 - 3:20:18)
What item was it? I mean, what was it that suggests that it was this one?

[Speaker 1] (3:20:19 - 3:20:21)
David, you're breaking up Alderman Moore.

[Speaker 12] (3:20:24 - 3:20:39)
I'm sorry. I said, evidently I missed. I heard a bunch of numbers, but what was the, I know what the concern is, but what topic or what ordinance was it?

What's the overall issue without going into detail just so I can remind some of us.

[Speaker 1] (3:20:40 - 3:20:51)
It was a development that was in Jeanette Taylor's ward, I believe, that passed plan commission in the entire- I need to know, I need to know.

[Speaker 33] (3:20:52 - 3:21:37)
This is a, yeah, sorry. Yeah, sorry, Alderman Moore, Chairman Kenney. This is a plan development that was established in 2021 for a development at 835 West 63rd Street in the 20th ward.

And the plan development statements, one and number eight in the PD statement that incorrectly gave the wrong information regarding the square feet of the property, as well as the ball table information was incorrectly passed out of committee on zoning. So this ordinance seeks to correct all that as well as move that forward. As you said, Chairman, it's a technical correction.

[Speaker 1] (3:21:38 - 3:21:41)
All right, Alderman Jeanette Taylor.

[Speaker 47] (3:21:43 - 3:22:07)
Thank you, Chairman. I ask that this be held because there is a problem with the RDA, was not sent to me nor to my community. And so I'm asking for the committee to hold this.

I have been in conversations with DPD and the developer, but when there is an agreement with the community and it's not in this, I was born that night, but it wasn't last night. And so I want this in writing.

[Speaker 1] (3:22:11 - 3:22:26)
So we passed this PD through plan commission and through zoning. I'm sure there was an RDA that was part of your negotiations if I'm not correct.

[Speaker 47] (3:22:27 - 3:22:46)
That has no clarity. And I've asked the questions and I've asked them for this, and I haven't gotten it. And this is not the only development that this developer is doing.

And so I've asked for the RDA. He would have three projects going real soon in my community. And I wanna make sure that the things that my community for are asked in writing.

[Speaker 40] (3:22:47 - 3:22:49)
All right, all right.

[Speaker 1] (3:22:51 - 3:22:58)
Do I have the, is Graham Grady on this? Particular issue?

[Speaker 41] (3:22:59 - 3:23:02)
Yes, Chairman Tony Graham Grady. I'm not sure if you can hear me or not. Can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (3:23:03 - 3:23:11)
We can. So you're the attorney of the plan development. You heard Alderwoman Taylor's issue.

[Speaker 41] (3:23:12 - 3:23:29)
Yes. Good afternoon. Alderwoman Taylor, I understand your situation.

I understand the issues. We respectfully request, we respectfully request that you allow this zoning technical amendment to go forward.

[Speaker 47] (3:23:30 - 3:23:46)
You have our assurances that the law department- I need that on public record and in writing to me and my community that that will happen. Or I will ask the committee, or I will organize my coworkers to vote this down. So I need that on this call and I need it in writing.

[Speaker 41] (3:23:46 - 3:24:20)
I sent a letter to you this morning, Alderman, to you as well as Joan, signed by both the applicant, signed by Leon Walker and signed by Greg Olson with the absolute assurances. And I also give you my word, Alderman, we understand the issues. We believe they are actually all in place, but we will modify the RDA through the city law department to give you absolutely what you're looking for.

First, on the live work, there are three issues. On the live work- All right, all right.

[Speaker 1] (3:24:20 - 3:24:34)
The two live work units are the- Wait, wait, wait, Graham, let me say, we're not going to get into the details. All right, Alderman, I respect- So I'm going to hold this, you and Alderman Taylor can figure this out. We will bring it up before the end of the meeting.

[Speaker 50] (3:24:35 - 3:24:35)
Very good.

[Speaker 1] (3:24:36 - 3:24:40)
And you guys figure this out. We've got a lot more work to do on this committee.

[Speaker 47] (3:24:40 - 3:24:46)
Chairman, I want this on record. I want this in the notes. Right, well, it'll be on the record, Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (3:24:47 - 3:24:48)
We are on the record as we speak.

[Speaker 41] (3:24:48 - 3:24:51)
Now- Also, Chairman, I did send the letter to you as well.

[Speaker 1] (3:24:52 - 3:24:57)
I sent the letter to you as well. Okay, here's what I'm telling you.

[Speaker 41] (3:24:57 - 3:24:57)
Please.

[Speaker 1] (3:24:58 - 3:25:19)
We've got about probably a couple hours to figure this out. We were going to bring this item back up. It is on the record.

We've got to figure out whether Alderman Taylor is comfortable with the RDA. And so she has the protections for her community. But I'm going to bring this up before the end of day.

[Speaker 41] (3:25:20 - 3:25:48)
Excellent. Chairman Tunney, thank you for that opportunity. We will work assiduously with Alderman Taylor over the next couple of hours.

And I'm highly confident we'll be able to work it out. We believe the substance is there that should satisfy the older women, and we will work on it. Thank you for that opportunity to pass this during the course of this hearing.

And we will get back to you promptly as soon as we can in the next couple of hours. Alderman Taylor, we will reach out to you and do whatever we can to satisfy you.

[Speaker 1] (3:25:48 - 3:25:49)
Thank you. Okay, we need to move on.

[Speaker 50] (3:25:50 - 3:25:50)
Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (3:25:51 - 3:27:03)
All right, so we're holding this in committee to later in the afternoon. Now, we're moving on to large signs over 100 square feet in area, 24 feet above grade. We'll hear them all together.

I will read the ward followed by the address and take a motion at the end. In the 26th ward, four signs located at 1044 North Francisco one sign in the 27th ward located at 551 North Ogden Avenue one sign in the 27th ward located at 1574 North Kingsbury four signs in the 27th ward located at 932 West Randolph one sign in the 41st ward located at 8725 West Higgins Road three signs in the 41st ward that are located at 7435 West Talcott Avenue four signs in the 44th ward located at 837 West Berry one sign in the 45th ward located at 5035 West Lawrence Avenue and lastly, one sign in the 50th ward located at 6008 North California.

If no questions by committee members, do I hear a motion to move do pass for the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 12] (3:27:03 - 3:27:05)
So moved by Alderman David Moore.

[Speaker 1] (3:27:05 - 3:27:38)
Alderman David Moore makes the motion. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, these orders are passed.

All right, we're gonna take about a 10 minute break. We will reconvene at 140 or 138 and we will get on to the regular agenda. I appreciate a little bit of patience on this.

It's been a long meeting so far and we've got to get through the regular agenda. All right, come back in 10 minutes.

[Speaker 50] (3:39:22 - 3:39:24)
Okey-doke, all right, good afternoon.

[Speaker 1] (3:39:24 - 3:40:11)
We'll now move on to the regular agenda in an effort to minimize technical difficulties and to ensure the committee meeting runs as smoothly as possible. The typical order in which items will be heard has been updated throughout the duration of virtual committee on zoning meetings. Items will be grouped together according to witness attorney and will be heard in that order rather than the ward order.

We're on page one. This is document number 21073 in the 33rd ward. Ordinance was referred on June 22nd of 22.

Common address, 3548 West Lawrence and the change request from B12 Neighborhood Shopping District to B32 Community Shopping District, Jimena Castro. Jimena Castro.

[Speaker 13] (3:40:13 - 3:40:57)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Jimena Castro, zoning attorney at Acosta-Ezgar. Zoning attorney for the matter before you today.

The property is improved with a two-story mixed use building with restaurant used on the ground floor, residential use above the ground floor. We seek to rezone the property from a B12 to a B32 to allow from a limited restaurant use to a general restaurant use to expand the existing bar at the restaurant to allow patrons to sit at the bar. We have a letter of support from the Aldo Women's Office as well that we have supplied to the committee on zoning and we seek your favorable consideration on this matter.

[Speaker 1] (3:40:58 - 3:41:09)
All right. We do have a letter of support from Aldo woman, Rodriguez Sanchez. Quickly, Jimena, the place has no liquor and then you're adding an incidental liquor license.

[Speaker 13] (3:41:10 - 3:41:18)
It has a small like bar where alcohol is served but it does not have the ability for patrons to sit at the bar.

[Speaker 1] (3:41:19 - 3:42:14)
So it's one of these service bar concepts. Okay, I get it. All right.

All right. We do have a letter of support from Rodriguez Sanchez. Questions by committee members?

Hearing none. Can I get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? That is Alderman David Moore makes the motion.

Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, this item is passed. Bottom of page one, document number 21061-T1 in the 28th ward.

Ordinance was deferred on June 22nd of 22. Common address is 2437 West Flournoy Street and the change request from an RT 3.5 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district to an RT four residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district. Jimena Castro again.

[Speaker 13] (3:42:15 - 3:42:49)
Mr. Chairman, for the record, my name is Jimena Castro, zoning attorney at Acosta-Escar, zoning attorney for the matter before you today. The subject property is improved with a two story single family residence with a detached two car garage. We seek to rezone the property from an RT 3.5 to an RT four to allow the building to be converted from a single family residence to a two flat and it will retain two parking spaces on site. I'd also like to ask for you, Mr. Chairman, if we can please make this substitute narrative and plans to be incorporated into the record.

[Speaker 1] (3:42:53 - 3:43:04)
Substantive narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the substantive narrative and plans are in front of us, continue.

[Speaker 13] (3:43:05 - 3:43:19)
Thank you very much. And we also have community and Aldermanic support for the matter before you today. And I believe the Alderman communicated his support on this item to the committee on zoning this morning and we seek your favorable consideration on this matter.

[Speaker 1] (3:43:20 - 3:43:31)
Correct, we do have a letter of support from Alderman Jason Irvin. Questions by committee members? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 19] (3:43:32 - 3:43:34)
So moved Chairman, Alderman Wagesback.

[Speaker 1] (3:43:34 - 3:44:10)
Alderman Wagesback makes the motion. Any objections to the motion? Hearing none, this item is passed with the substantive narrative and plans.

All right, top of page two. Document number 21078-T1 in the 25th Ward. Ordinance was referred on June 22nd of 2022.

Common address is 2236 West Cermak Road and the change request from a B3-2 Community Shopping District to a B2-3 Neighborhood Mixed Use District, Jimena Castro.

[Speaker 13] (3:44:11 - 3:45:18)
Mr. Chairman, for the record, my name is Jimena Castro, Zoning Attorney for Acosta-Escort, Zoning Attorney for the matter before you today. The property, the subject property is one zoning lot that consists of two parcels known as 2236 and 2238 West Cermak. 2236 is a vacant lot, 2238 is improved with a one-story commercial building.

We seek to rezone the property from a B3-2 to a B2-3 to subdivide the parcels into two zoning lots to allow on the vacant parcel 2236, a three-story six-unit building with three parking spaces. And also we seek a TOD parking reduction through the type one zoning application. And this, to clarify the record, this particular zoning only concerns 2236, which is a vacant parcel.

I'd also like to amend the application to allow for narrative implants, substitute narrative implants to be incorporated as well.

[Speaker 1] (3:45:20 - 3:45:43)
All right, so we first have to accept the substitute narrative implants for the type one. So Alderman Roboius moves to accept the substitute narrative implants for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that?

Okay, hearing none, the substitute narrative implants are accepted. And is that the basis, end of your presentation?

[Speaker 13] (3:45:44 - 3:46:04)
I'd also like to add for the record that we have worked with the Alderman's office to provide an elective affordable unit through an affordable covenant at the subject property as well. And that we have, I believe we have a letter of support from the Alderman's office that was supplied to the committee this morning.

[Speaker 1] (3:46:04 - 3:46:08)
All right, Alderman Siccio-Lopez.

[Speaker 17] (3:46:12 - 3:46:28)
Thank you, Chairman. And yes, we do just for the record, we work with the applicant and our zoning advisory board to fulfill the commitments requested by that. And after completion of that review, we ask our colleagues for a favorable support on this item.

Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (3:46:29 - 3:46:50)
Thank you. Quick question for you, Jimena. I'm reading the purpose on the notice.

It says you're splitting a lot, two lots. One has a commercial building and the other- It's a vacant lot. But you said three stories, six dwelling unit.

[Speaker 13] (3:46:50 - 3:46:58)
Correct, so we supplied a substitute narrative to show six units.

[Speaker 1] (3:46:58 - 3:46:59)
From three to six.

[Speaker 13] (3:46:59 - 3:47:00)
Correct.

[Speaker 1] (3:47:00 - 3:47:02)
Alderman Siccio-Lopez, you're good with that?

[Speaker 13] (3:47:04 - 3:47:08)
That was what the Alderman approved. It was a typo.

[Speaker 1] (3:47:09 - 3:47:51)
Okay. Correct, Chairman, confirmed. Okay, just want to double check.

All right, thank you. Okay, so Alderman Roboyes moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, this item will be passed with the substantive narrative and plans. All right, middle of page two. Who's deferring?

Okay, so I'm gonna read this. This is item, Ms. Castro is being deferred by Alderman Siccio-Lopez, and I'll read it into the record.

[Speaker 13] (3:47:51 - 3:47:51)

The subject property is improved with a two-story residential building with six units. We seek to rezone the property from a B23 to a B23 type one as a mandatory type one amendment to correct the drawings that were published in May 2022 by city council that will convert the existing building from six to nine units.

We seek your favorable consideration and we also have Aldermanic support as well.

[Speaker 1] (3:49:27 - 3:49:32)

[Speaker 17] (3:49:33 - 3:49:50)
Thank you, Chairman. We also work for quite some time to reach an agreement with the applicant and the Zoning Advisory Board after reviewed all the commitments made by the applicant as well as the request of the Zoning Advisory Board for favorable consideration on this item as well. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (3:49:51 - 3:50:36)

Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the item is passed. All right, top of page three, document number 21077 in the 12th Ward, ordinance was referred on June 22nd of 2022.

Common address is 2623 West 24th Street. And the change request from an RT4, residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to an RM5 residential multi-unit district. Jimena Castro on this.

[Speaker 13] (3:50:37 - 3:51:15)
Mr. Chairman, again, for the record, my name is Jimena Castro, Zoning Attorney at Acosta Esker, Zoning Attorney for the matter before you today. The subject property is a two-story residential building with three dwelling units and no parking. We seek to rezone the property from an RT4 to an RM5 to add one unit in the attic for a total of four units on the property.

And the applicant will be providing three parking spaces on site as well. We have support from the Alderman's office and a letter of support from his office was provided to the committee on zoning this morning. And we seek a favorable consideration from yourself and the committee on this item.

[Speaker 1] (3:51:16 - 3:51:19)
All right, Ms. Castro, explain to me how you found parking.

[Speaker 13] (3:51:22 - 3:51:25)
There will be three surface parking spaces in the rear.

[Speaker 1] (3:51:26 - 3:51:32)
So the current property says it has no parking, is that correct in your testimony?

[Speaker 13] (3:51:32 - 3:51:47)
Correct, so there's just no designated parking spaces in the back. We will be creating three designated surface parking spaces in the back. It will be delineated and- Okay, all right.

[Speaker 1] (3:51:47 - 3:52:05)
I just sounded a little weird to me. All right, questions by committee members? We do have a letter of support from Alderman Cardenas.

Can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 50] (3:52:05 - 3:52:06)
Moved to pass, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (3:52:07 - 3:52:16)
Alderman Wagesvac makes the motion. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Thank you, have a good day, Ms. Castro. All right.

[Speaker 47] (3:52:16 - 3:52:17)
Thank you, you as well.

[Speaker 1] (3:52:19 - 3:53:06)
Do we have to make- Take a motion on it. Okay, so we're, okay, we are going to, middle of page three, we're gonna entertain a motion to defer this item, that being document number 21050 in the 47th ward, the ordinance was referred on June 22nd of 2022, and the common address is 1756 West Newport Avenue, the change request from an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RT4 residential two-ply townhouse and multi-unit district. And this is a motion to defer by Alderman Martin. All right, Ms. Barnes, you're aware of that motion?

Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman. I am aware of the motion, no objections.

[Speaker 1] (3:53:12 - 3:53:49)
All right, so Alderman Wagesback makes the motion to defer this item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objection? Hearing none, this item will be deferred.

All right, bottom of page three, document number 21070, T1 in the 47th ward. The ordinance was referred on June 22nd of 2022, and the common address is 3310 and 3312 North Lincoln Avenue, the change request from B12 Neighborhood Shopping District to B33 Community Shopping District. Sarah Barnes.

[Speaker 18] (3:53:50 - 3:54:47)
Thank you so much. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and esteemed members of the committee. For the record, my name is Sarah Barnes, and I'm an attorney with the Losses of Sam Banks.

I'm happy to be here this afternoon on behalf of the applicant 3312 Lincoln LLC. Before I begin, Mr. Chairman, I would like to note for the record that prior to these proceedings, but subsequent to the submission of our original application, certain modifications were made to the type one architectural plans that support this application. Those substitute plans, along with a substitute type one zoning narrative, were tendered to Ms. Anna Robles, the Department of Planning and Development prior to this proceeding, as well as to your office. I would, therefore, please respectfully request that those items be accepted into today's record.

[Speaker 1] (3:54:48 - 3:55:03)
All right, so Alderman Ravoyos moves to accept the substantive narrative plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, we have the substantive narrative plans in front of us, and they're accepted.

[Speaker 7] (3:55:04 - 3:55:04)
Ms. Barnes.

[Speaker 18] (3:55:05 - 3:57:33)
Thank you so much. With no further ado, the subject site consists of three contiguous lots that is presently improved in its entirety with three conjoined buildings that span the entirety of the site, therefore leaving no room for off-street accessory parking. The applicant is proposing to raise all of those improvements and to redevelop the site with a new six-story mixed-use building that will contain some substantial commercial space on the first floor, along with interior parking for seven vehicles, with a total of 24 dwelling units to be located on the second through sixth floors.

The 24 dwelling units will be a diverse mix of one-bedroom, two-bedroom, and three-bedroom units. As part of this proposal, I am pleased to also advise that five of the 24 units will be designated as on-site affordable units, and again, will represent a diverse mix of one-bedroom, two-bedroom, and three-bedroom units. Due to the site's very close proximity to multiple forms of public transit, including the CTA elevated train station, as well as a designated bus line corridor, we are pursuing this application and pursuant to certain transit-served location, the LEAP and bonuses as offered under the current zoning ordinance.

This project underwent very robust community review, starting with Alderman Martin and his 47th Ward Zoning Advisory Committee. The project was also vetted by the West Lakeview neighbors, as well as the Lakeview Roscoe Village Chamber of Commerce, and to the applicant and the entire development team, including myself, worked very closely with the Adjacent Homeowners Association towards the completion of the programming that you see before you here today. I'm happy to report that as a result of that ongoing community review and one final public community meeting, we do have the support of all of the four referenced interested parties, including Alderman Martin, who tendered a copy of his letter of support to your office, Mr. Chairman. I believe it was yesterday.

[Speaker 1] (3:57:36 - 3:58:28)
And- We do have a letter of support from Alderman Martin. Questions, comments from committee members? Hearing none, Alderwoman Austin makes motion to move do pass.

That was Dowell. Oh, I'm sorry. Alderwoman Dowell made the motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections to her motion? Hearing none, this item is passed with the substantive narrative and plans. All right.

On the top page four. What are we doing, another motion? All right.

This is another motion to defer by Alderwoman Smith. Ms. Farnes, you're aware of this item on 2222 North Halstead?

[Speaker 18] (3:58:28 - 3:58:32)
I am, Mr. Chairman. And again, no objection.

[Speaker 1] (3:58:32 - 3:58:59)
All right. Document number 21068, 43rd Ward. Ordinance was referred on 622 of 22.

And the address is 2222 North Halstead and the change request from an RT4 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district to an RM5 residential multi-unit district. Can I have a motion to defer this item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 50] (3:59:01 - 3:59:02)
That would be. I move, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (3:59:03 - 3:59:42)
Vice Chair Raboias makes the motion. Any objections to the motion to defer? No objections.

This item will be deferred. Middle of page four. Document number 21062, T1 in the 47th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on June 22nd of 2022. And the common address, 1654 West School Street. And the change request from B32 Community Shopping District to B23 Neighborhood Mixed Use District.

Again, Sarah Barnes on this item in 47.

[Speaker 18] (3:59:43 - 4:00:02)
Yes, we're aware this one's being deferred as well. There's been some 11th hour modifications that have been requested by the community. And because it is a type one zoning change application, we wanna ensure that the plans properly reflect those modifications.

So you will be seeing a lot of me come September.

[Speaker 1] (4:00:04 - 4:00:23)
All right. So then Alderman Wogasek makes a motion to defer this item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to the motion to defer?

No objections. This item will also be deferred. All right.

And I guess we're doing.

[Speaker 18] (4:00:28 - 4:00:30)
Next one's already been deferred.

[Speaker 1] (4:00:31 - 4:00:32)
So we're on the top of what?

[Speaker 18] (4:00:33 - 4:00:34)
Top of page five.

[Speaker 1] (4:00:34 - 4:00:41)
Okay. So we're done. I think we're done with you, Sarah.

[Speaker 18] (4:00:41 - 4:00:44)
Fine, thank you. So I'll leave you with Nick in a few minutes.

[Speaker 1] (4:00:45 - 4:00:46)
Okay. All right.

[Speaker 7] (4:00:46 - 4:00:47)
Have a great day.

[Speaker 1] (4:00:47 - 4:00:54)
So I'm gonna ask my vice chair, Revoyas to start on the top of page five in the 44th ward.

[Speaker 46] (4:00:58 - 4:01:50)
Okay. In the 44th ward, file number 21063-T1, which was referred on 62222 for the common address known as 1300 West Addison Street. The change request is an RT 3.5 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to a B3-2 community shopping district. This item has a substitute narrative and plans. Alderman Capelman moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call used to deferring quorum. Are there any objections?

Hearing none, the substitute narrative and plans are accepted. We have Alderman, actually we have attorney Tim Barton here to present on this matter.

[Speaker 29] (4:01:52 - 4:03:49)
Good afternoon, Alderman Revoyas, members of the committee. I'm Tim Barton. I'm an attorney with the law firm of Tom Raines.

I'm here on behalf of the applicant 1300 Addison LLC to request the rezoning of the property at 1300 West Addison from an RT 3.5 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to a B3-2 community shopping district. The subject site is improved with a three-story mixed use building with a well-known neighborhood tavern called named Guthrie's on the first floor and two residential units above on the second and third floor. The applicant is seeking the rezoning in order to provide an outdoor patio at the rear of the property.

Guthrie's has operated here at this location for 36 years. The building's first floor historically has been commercial dating back to the turn of the last century. It was initially a corner grocery store.

After prohibition, it became a tavern and Guthrie's opened in 1986. In January of 2021, two of its patrons purchased the tavern and have undertaken substantial improvements while maintaining its traditional neighborhood character. Other than these changes, there will be no change to the building's exterior.

I understand the alderman is in favor of this and I would hope he could speak to this now.

[Speaker 46] (4:03:50 - 4:03:54)
Well, let's find out. Thank you, Tim. Chairman, would you like to speak on the matter before us?

[Speaker 1] (4:03:55 - 4:04:32)
Thank you, Vice Chair. Yes, this new ownership group has, I don't know, reactivated, re-energized this corner of Addison. It is surrounded in a lot of ways by residential, but they have been a great neighbor.

They're excited about it. And we're excited to see us preserving what was this longstanding community asset, I would say. And so no objections from the neighbors and has my full support.

And I hope the committee would support me on this item.

[Speaker 46] (4:04:33 - 4:04:38)
Thank you, Chairman. Is there anyone that wish to ask any questions or comments on the subject matter?

[Speaker 19] (4:04:40 - 4:04:43)
If there are no questions- Vice Chairman, I'll make a motion to pass Alderman Wagesbeck.

[Speaker 46] (4:04:44 - 4:04:58)
Okay, Alderman Wagesbeck makes a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. All in favor? All opposed?

Any hearing? Thank you for your consideration. Thank you, Tim.

All right.

[Speaker 1] (4:04:59 - 4:05:02)
Anna, is this on the item in 44?

[Speaker 20] (4:05:05 - 4:05:13)
Yes, Chairman. Just confirming that the substitute was introduced. I don't remember hearing that.

[Speaker 14] (4:05:14 - 4:05:15)
Oh, member Boyles did.

[Speaker 1] (4:05:15 - 4:05:18)
Yeah, he accepted, we accepted. He accepted the substitute narrative.

[Speaker 20] (4:05:18 - 4:05:18)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (4:05:19 - 4:05:50)
Okay. Thank you. Very competent vice chair that I have.

Thank you, sir. All right, middle of page. Thank you, Ariel.

Middle of page five. Document number 21059 in the 47th ward. Ordinance was referred on June 22nd of 2022.

Common address 1616 to 1630 West Montrose Avenue and the change request from B13 Neighborhood Shopping District to C13 Neighborhood Commercial District. Andrew Scott on this item.

[Speaker 8] (4:06:08 - 4:06:14)
All right, Andrew, can you hear me now?

[Speaker 20] (4:06:15 - 4:06:16)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (4:06:16 - 4:06:20)
Yes, Andrew, proceed on this item on West Montrose in 47.

[Speaker 8] (4:06:20 - 4:07:02)
Thank you, Chairman, members of the committee. For the record, my name is Andrew Scott with the Law Offices of 19 Cossett. We're here with a very straightforward rezoning here.

The property is currently zoned B13 and we are seeking to rezone it to C13 to accommodate a tenant in the building who will operate a massage therapy establishment. We have spoken with Alderman Martin and we are more than agreeable to rezoning the property back to B13 once the tenant is able to secure all the necessary licenses and permits to operate. No other changes to the building and we would appreciate the committee's general consideration.

[Speaker 1] (4:07:05 - 4:07:56)
Thank you, Andrew. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Martin. Questions, comments from committee members?

Hearing none, Alderman Wagesback makes the motion move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, this item is passed.

All right. All right, now we're on the bottom of page five, document number 21056 in the 42nd Ward. Ordinance was referred on June 22nd of 2022.

Common address is 210 through 212 North Canal Street and the change request from DX7, Downtown Mixed Use District, to DS7, Downtown Service District. We have Nick Fatikas.

[Speaker 30] (4:07:57 - 4:08:44)
Thank you, Chairman. Nick Fatikas for the record. I am here on behalf of the owner and applicant of the subject property.

The existing building is actually a one and actually a three-story mixed use retail building with no residential units. The proposed zoning change is being sought to permit food and beverage catering within one of those existing retail spaces that currently operates with the retail food and incidental liquor license. There are no proposed building expansions as part of this zoning change.

This is a use space change to allow the catering use. Our office worked directly with Alderman Riley's office on this proposal. I believe the Alderman is present to speak as to his position.

[Speaker 1] (4:08:46 - 4:09:11)
All right. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Riley, but we'd be happy to hear from our proprietor. The staff.

Oh, I'm sorry. I thought we were gonna hear from the applicant itself, but we do have a representative from Alderman Riley's office. Would you like to comment on this, Joanna?

[Speaker 6] (4:09:14 - 4:09:18)
Yes, good morning or good afternoon, Chairman and committee members. Can you hear me okay?

[Speaker 1] (4:09:18 - 4:09:19)
We can.

[Speaker 6] (4:09:20 - 4:09:42)
Thank you. My name is Joanna Ingram. I'm from Alderman Riley's office.

I'm Alderman Riley's director of business affairs and development. Alderman Riley fully supports this applicant's request to rezone the property at 210 North Canal from DX7 to DS7 in order to allow the existing business the ability to offer catering services. Alderman Riley asks for your favorable consideration of this item.

[Speaker 12] (4:09:43 - 4:09:44)
Great.

[Speaker 1] (4:09:44 - 4:09:46)
Thank you, Joanna. And the name of the business?

[Speaker 30] (4:09:47 - 4:09:49)
So it's actually the Clayton.

[Speaker 1] (4:09:51 - 4:10:42)
All righty. All righty. Any questions, comments from committee members?

Hearing none. Can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? So moved.

That was my vice chair, Roboius. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

All right, moving on page six. Document number 21067 in the T1 in the 40th ward. Ordinance was referred on June 22nd of 2022.

Common address 4912 Northwestern Avenue and the change request from RT4 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district to a B31.5 community shopping district. Nick Fatikas again.

[Speaker 30] (4:10:43 - 4:11:32)
Thank you again, chairman for the record. Nick Fatikas on behalf of the property owner and applicant. Again, in this case, we're dealing with an existing two-story mixed use building that's located on a unique lot that's bound by Northwestern Avenue to the west and North Lincoln Avenue to the west.

I'm sorry. And in this case, what we're doing is trying to permit a proposed one-story addition that would expand the ground floor retail unit at the subject property. We did meet with Alderman Vasquez and obtain a letter of support.

I'd point out for the record that this is a type one application and we did file a substitute narrative and plan set as part of our review with zoning. Just want to make sure that you have both the plans that narrative as well as the Alderman's letter of support.

[Speaker 1] (4:11:33 - 4:12:46)
Okay, so Alderman Roboius moved to accept the substantive narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that? Hearing none, the substantive narrative and plans are accepted.

We do have a letter of support from Alderman Vasquez. Are you finished with your presentation? Yes, sir.

All righty. Questions, comments from committee members? Again, we do have a letter of support from Alderman Vasquez.

Motion to pass chairman if it's, you're ready. Augustak makes the motion move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to his motion?

Hearing none, this item is passed with the substantive narrative and plans. All right, moving on. Document number 21060, 39th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on June 22nd of 2022. Common address is 6320 through 6324 North Milwaukee Avenue and the change request from a B31 community shopping district to a B32 community shopping district. Nick and this item in the 39th Ward, please.

[Speaker 30] (4:12:47 - 4:13:26)
Thank you again, chairman. For the record, Nick Fatikas on behalf of the applicant and property owner. Chairman, in this case, we're seeking a zoning change to permit the residential conversion of a second floor of an existing building.

Today, it's a two story building with multiple use retail office space. The proposal would allow three residential units to be located on the second floor of the existing building. We work directly with Alderman Nugent's office on this proposal, as well as the Gladstone Park Community Organization.

A letter of support should be already on file with your office. And I'd be happy to answer any questions you or the committee members have about our program.

[Speaker 1] (4:13:27 - 4:13:38)
Nick, we do have a letter of support from Alderwoman Nugent. Just a quick question. So you have one commercial and three residential.

Am I seeing any parking?

[Speaker 30] (4:13:39 - 4:13:57)
Yeah, so the rear of the property actually affords us three onsite parking spaces. So the three parking spaces will be dedicated toward the new residential units that would be permitted. No required parking for the commercial that will remain on the first floor of the building.

[Speaker 1] (4:13:57 - 4:14:15)
Great, okay. Thank you. Questions, comments from committee members?

Hearing none, Alderman Ravois makes a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, this item is passed.

[Speaker 50] (4:14:15 - 4:14:16)
Thank you, sir.

[Speaker 38] (4:14:40 - 4:15:33)
Mr. Moore. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. This is a property owned by a caterer who does a very nice job, but he finds that he can't compete because he does events at locations.

There's no events at this location. This location is purely a kitchen and a conference room to sign people up. But when he goes to events, he can't compete because he can't get a liquor license.

So the purpose of this would be, allow him to get a liquor license so that he could, at the events he caters, he could also present liquor. We have the support of Alderman Sposato, and we'd request your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (4:15:35 - 4:15:44)
All right. So there's, this person generally needs an off-premise catering liquor license.

[Speaker 50] (4:15:45 - 4:15:45)
That's right.

[Speaker 1] (4:15:46 - 4:15:57)
And there's no on-site consumption. None at all. And we do have a letter of support from Alderman Sposato.

Any questions, comments from committee members?

[Speaker 41] (4:15:58 - 4:15:59)
Moved to pass, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (4:16:00 - 4:16:33)
Alderman Waguespack. Alderman Waguespack moves do pass by the same roll call it was used to determine quorum. Any objections to his motion?

Hearing none, the item is passed. All right, top of page seven, document number 21071-T1. In the 26th ward, ordinance was referred on June 22nd of 2022.

Common address, 3552 West Grand Avenue. And the change request from M12, Limited Manufacturing Business Park District to B32 Community Shopping District.

[Speaker 38] (4:16:34 - 4:17:38)
Again, Tom Moore on this item. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is a huge lot, 133,000 square feet with a 34,000 square foot building on it, 176 parking spaces.

It was a CVS, but the CVS has been closed for about 10 years. Alderman Maldonado, at some point, zoned it to M, I think to give the community some say in what might happen to it. We now have a local grocer who has a smaller store across the street, but would like to provide much more enhanced and diverse grocery services.

Alderman Maldonado was thrilled because they're somewhat of a food desert at this location. And we have a letter of support from him. There is a substitute narrative and plans that we'd ask you to accept before voting.

[Speaker 46] (4:17:42 - 4:17:43)
So move on to substitute, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (4:17:43 - 4:17:51)
Well, well, well, well, well, hold on a second. Anna, have you received the substantive narrative and plans on this item?

[Speaker 23] (4:17:52 - 4:17:53)
Yes, Chairman.

[Speaker 2] (4:17:53 - 4:17:57)
Just today, there were some changes to the photos that were provided.

[Speaker 1] (4:17:57 - 4:18:22)
Okay. So Alderman Ravois makes a motion to move the substantive narrative and plans by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, the substantive narrative and plans are in front of us. Again, testimony has already been stated, correct, Mr. Moore?

[Speaker 38] (4:18:22 - 4:18:23)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (4:18:24 - 4:18:40)
All right, we have a letter of support from Alderman Maldonado. Any questions or comments? Other than it looks like a great addition, what was formerly a CVS and now it's gonna be a grocery store?

That's right. Not a bad thing.

[Speaker 12] (4:18:40 - 4:18:41)
Put it that way.

[Speaker 1] (4:18:43 - 4:19:25)
All right, so Alderman Wagesbeck moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, this item is passed with the substantive narrative and plans.

All right. Thank you very much. Thank you, middle of page seven, document number 21072, 35th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on June 22nd of 2022. This common address, 2901 North Milwaukee Avenue and the change request from the B23 Neighborhood Mixed-Use District to C13 Neighborhood Commercial District. We have Daniel Rubinow in the 35th Ward.

[Speaker 45] (4:19:26 - 4:20:38)
Good afternoon, Chairman and committee members. My name is Daniel Rubinow. I'm with the law firm of Trolia Kaplan and represent Deep Red Wine Merchants LLC at 2901 North Milwaukee, which is a two-story building.

Just by way of history, this was previously changed, I believe, within the last year from a B1 to a B2. It was an empty building, and I believe they added nine units and a retail unit on the first floor. I represent a retail owner moving in, and we would like to change it from B2 to a C13 because the retail applicant is an upscale wine store.

And in order to get a packaged goods license, we need to change that to at least a C. So we're applying for that. We've been working closely with the alderman who has written letter of support and is also introducing an ordinance to lift the packaged goods ordinance moratorium.

And besides that, the building is not changing at all. We're just asking that it be changed so that we can get packaged goods in there. All right.

[Speaker 1] (4:20:39 - 4:20:50)
Daniel, the C13, why the three? Is that the number of units on the site or something?

[Speaker 45] (4:20:50 - 4:20:54)
I believe it is. There are at least nine units at the location.

[Speaker 1] (4:20:55 - 4:21:13)
All right, we do have a letter of support from Alderman Ramirez Rosa. Alderman Wagesvac makes a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing on this item is passed.

[Speaker 50] (4:21:14 - 4:21:15)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (4:21:15 - 4:21:49)
Thank you, sir. Bottom of page seven, document number 21065-T1 in the 32nd Ward. Ordinance was referred on June 22nd of 2022 and the common address 1894 to 1896 North Milwaukee Avenue and the change request from M11 Limited Manufacturing Business Park District to B11 Neighborhood Shopping District.

And we have Liz Butler or we have Liz on this one.

[Speaker 6] (4:21:50 - 4:25:01)
Hi, Chairman. I'm on. Thank you.

Good afternoon, Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Liz Butler. I'm a partner with the law firm of L.

Rod Friedman LLP located at 325 North LaSalle Street in Chicago. Our firm represents the applicant in this matter, 1894 NMLLC. I'm joined today by Jay Weaver, who is the manager of the applicant and the owner of the subject property.

And Joe Bueller from Present Future Architects who are the architect for the project. So the applicant is requesting a type one zoning map amendment to rezone the property at 1894 North Milwaukee Avenue from the M11 Limited Manufacturing District to the B11 Neighborhood Shopping District in order to establish and operate a daycare at the existing building that's located at the property. The property contains about 600 and I'm sorry, 6,600 square feet of site area.

It's bounded by Milwaukee Avenue on the Northeast and the CTA Blue Line tracks to the rear. The property contains an existing single story commercial building which has been vacant for many years. The daycare is proposing to operate a full day lay based childcare program.

They'll operate from approximately 7 a.m. to approximately 6 p.m. five days a week and will serve a maximum of 75 children ranging in ages from six weeks old to five years old. And you see the elevations being shown on the screen now. The property is well served by transit and bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure.

And the majority of children and employees are expected to walk to the facility. The daycare will work with the Alderman's Office and CDOT to establish a loading zone on the street in front of the building. And a staff member from the daycare will be assigned to stay outside during pickup and drop off to coordinate safe arrival operations.

The applicant is also intending to renovate the existing building by adding new modernized finishes, upgraded building mechanicals, water heater and to upgrade the facade as you saw on the elevations. The applicant discussed the proposal with Alderman Wagesbeck's staff and we met with the Bucktown Community Organization. A number of project enhancements were made as a result of our engagement with the Neighbor Association.

And we understand that Alderman Wagesbeck has expressed no objection to the request and a letter to that effect was provided to the committee in advance of this hearing. So we thank the committee and respectfully request your favorable recommendation of this change. Our team is available to answer any questions that the committee might have.

[Speaker 1] (4:25:01 - 4:25:03)
Thank you. Thank you. Alderman Wagesbeck.

[Speaker 19] (4:25:04 - 4:25:23)
Thanks chairman. Ms. Butler did a great job explaining it, but also all the work that they put into it and we're taking a defunct building here and putting it into operation with the daycare. And for that reason, I'd ask for the committee's favorable support.

I definitely support this and as we move forward on this change. Thank you.

[Speaker 34] (4:25:25 - 4:25:36)
All right. All right. Top of page eight.

I'm sorry.

[Speaker 50] (4:25:37 - 4:25:38)
I did a motion here.

[Speaker 34] (4:25:38 - 4:25:39)
I'm sorry.

[Speaker 1] (4:25:39 - 4:26:17)
Alderman Wagesbeck makes the motion move to pass by the same roll call that was used in determined quorum. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

All right. I want to take a hold on one second before we get to the next item. And we are on the top of page seven.

Document number 21071T1. No, we're not on that one.

[Speaker 12] (4:26:18 - 4:26:20)
Sorry about that, folks.

[Speaker 1] (4:26:21 - 4:26:48)
I'm getting texts and messages and trying to run the meeting at the same time. All right. Top of page eight.

Document number 21069T1 in the 27th ward. Ordinance was referred on June 22nd of 2022. The common address is 2405 West Grand Avenue and the change request from M12 Limited Manufacturing Business Park District to C13 Neighborhood Commercial District.

[Speaker 34] (4:26:49 - 4:26:50)
Liz Butler.

[Speaker 6] (4:26:50 - 4:28:07)
Thank you, chairman. Good afternoon again. My name is Liz Butler.

I'm a partner with the law firm of L. Rod Friedman. We're located at 325 North LaSalle Street in Chicago.

And we represent the applicant in this matter, RDM Ventures, LLC. I am joined today by Jim Piniella, the managing partner of RDM Ventures, and Ben Kennedy of Kennedy Mann, the project architect for the proposed development. As a housekeeping matter, we submitted a substitute narrative and analysis ahead of the committee meeting.

A page of the zoning narrative and analysis that was part of the original application was inadvertently left out of the package that was transmitted to the clerk. And we discovered that over the last couple of days, coordinating with Anna, with Ms. Robles, there are no substantive changes to the project data from the plans in the original application that were submitted and introduced. So this substitute is technical in nature just to correct and include that missing page of the document.

So we would ask that the committee consider the substitute materials.

[Speaker 1] (4:28:08 - 4:28:22)
All right, Alderman Robles has moved to accept the substantive narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call or refused to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the substantive narrative and plans are accepted.

You can proceed.

[Speaker 6] (4:28:22 - 4:28:59)
Thank you. The applicant is requesting a type one zoning map amendment to rezone the property located at 2405 West Grand Avenue from the M12 limited manufacturing and business park district to the C13 neighborhood commercial district in order to construct a five-story mixed-use multifamily building with ground floor commercial and 40 residential dwelling units. The property is generally located at the corner of Grand and Western Avenue.

It contains... I'm sorry.

[Speaker 1] (4:29:00 - 4:29:01)
Continue, Liz, I'm sorry.

[Speaker 6] (4:29:02 - 4:31:19)
Thanks. It contains about 11,203 square feet of net site area. It's currently vacant and unimproved except for an existing billboard sign, which will be taken down as part of the proposed development.

So the applicant is proposing to develop the site, as I said, with a five-story mixed-use multifamily residential building with approximately 4,745 square feet of ground floor commercial space, 40 residential units, 11 parking spaces, and one loading berth. The overall project FAR will be 3.5. The change request from the M12 district to the C13 district is needed to authorize this residential development of the property, which is consistent with the zoning and land uses to the north and the trend of development in this area. The property qualifies as a transit-served location based on its proximity to both the Western Avenue CTA I'm sorry, to the Western Avenue Bus Line Corridor and to the Western Avenue Metro Rail Station entrance.

The proposal includes requests for a transit-served location parking reduction, MLA reduction, and FAR increase. And we meet all of the criteria for approval of a project under the transit-served location ordinance in effect today. The development team worked closely with Alderman Burnett and his staff and met with the immediate neighbors of the subject property.

We hosted multiple stakeholder and community meetings to discuss the proposed development and made a number of enhancements that were all a result of that community, ongoing community review and engagement. We understand that the Alderman is in support of the proposed development and the requested change and has provided a letter of support to the committee in advance of this hearing. So we thank the committee and request its favorable consideration of this matter.

And our team is available to answer any questions that the committee might have.

[Speaker 1] (4:31:20 - 4:31:24)
All right, we have Alderman Burnett on the call on this one, Walter.

[Speaker 50] (4:31:44 - 4:31:53)
Alderman Burnett. I'm sorry, Tim.

[Speaker 29] (4:32:20 - 4:32:24)
Chairman Alderman Burnett was here, but it seems like he dropped off just seconds ago.

[Speaker 1] (4:32:25 - 4:33:16)
Where is Alderman Burnett? We're waiting a minute or two for Walter to come back on the call, please. Committee members, we're going to have to take a recess.

We're gonna move to rules for about 20 minutes, but I will try to get this application done and then reconvene probably closer to three o'clock.

[Speaker 19] (4:33:18 - 4:33:44)
Yeah, all right, I'm not finding. Chairman, just a question. So it's probably a separate Zoom meeting.

So we will use the same Zoom for this meeting.

[Speaker 1] (4:33:44 - 4:33:48)
How about tech support? The question is, do we use the same Zoom when we reconvene?

[Speaker 6] (4:33:53 - 4:33:57)
Just use the Zoom that's for exits, for rules, sorry.

[Speaker 1] (4:33:59 - 4:34:01)
Rules has its own Zoom meeting.

[Speaker 6] (4:34:02 - 4:34:16)
Correct, yeah. So this one can continue on live stream and then we'll just pause, we'll be on recess. Well, everyone should log into the other link and then- Or rules, and then we'll be back to this one.

[Speaker 50] (4:34:17 - 4:34:17)
Yeah.

[Speaker 29] (4:34:18 - 4:34:28)
The live stream will discontinue of this meeting. Zoom can continue. Okay.

We'll have to start the other live stream. All right, so attorneys, do you hear this?

[Speaker 1] (4:34:28 - 4:34:36)
We have to take, we'll reconvene, stay on the Zoom. We'll reconvene at three. How do you reconvene?

[Speaker 50] (4:34:38 - 4:34:39)
Kamal.

[Speaker 1] (4:34:41 - 4:34:45)
Kamal, TAC, would you- Repeat that for the attorneys.

[Speaker 50] (4:34:48 - 4:34:49)
So this Zoom will continue.

[Speaker 29] (4:34:50 - 4:35:10)
Everyone who is not an alderman can stay in this Zoom and I will disconnect the live stream, but the Zoom will continue. Okay. And then once we are done with the rules, then all the aldermans can join back this Zoning Zoom and then we'll start the live stream again.

[Speaker 7] (4:35:13 - 4:35:20)
TAC support. Who's doing promotion of panelists on the rules committee meeting?

[Speaker 29] (4:35:21 - 4:35:25)
Chairwoman, I am. I'm sorry, I was distracted here.

[Speaker 15] (4:35:27 - 4:35:41)
Okay. So- Guys, I apologize. I'm in now.

I support this 100%. We had a community meeting. We had two community meetings and we all supported, so.

[Speaker 1] (4:35:41 - 4:36:30)
All right. So Alderman Roboyes moves to pass on this item on Grand Avenue by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

As you said, we've heard the support of the alderman. Hearing no objections, this item is passed with the substantive narrative and plans, that being the Grand Avenue. All right.

Now, so we are going to take a recess. The Zoom will remain and the attorneys need to stay on the Zoom. All right.

Now, Alderman Roboyes' question was, he's got to get on the rules and then he can click back to this original Zoom to reconvene the Zoning meeting.

[Speaker 7] (4:36:30 - 4:36:30)
Correct.

[Speaker 1] (4:36:31 - 4:36:38)
All right. Committee members on Zoning, we'll see you at three. God willing.

Okay. All right.

[Speaker 50] (4:36:39 - 4:36:39)
All right.
