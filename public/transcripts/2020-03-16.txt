[Speaker 40] (3:49 - 4:37)
Today, I'm going to give you a brief introduction to how to make a simple, easy-to-use,

[Speaker 42] (10:52 - 11:33)
easy-to-use, easy-to-use, easy-to-use, easy-to-use, easy-to-use, easy-to-use, easy-to-use, easy-to-use, easy-to-use, easy-to-use, easy-to-use, easy-to-use, easy-to-use, easy-to-use, easy-to-use, easy-to-use, easy-to-use, easy-to-use,

So at this time, we will now begin public comment period. Out of respect for everyone's time. Each speaker is limited to three minutes to address all items on the agenda.

This will be the only opportunity to address these items on the agenda and the committee will not conduct separate public comment before each agenda item. I think we're over here on the left-hand side, followed by David Kalata. I think both of these are on the utility.

[Speaker 29] (18:34 - 20:12)
Right here, sir? Yes, sir. Good morning.

Good morning. My name is Mark Nabong. I am an attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, NRDC.

We are here in support of the Electric Vehicle Make Ready Ordinance today. Chicago has an opportunity to be a world leader in technology, a world leader in industry, a world leader in logistics. The future of transportation is going to be clean.

It's going to be emission-free. And more to the point, emission-free vehicles are good for everybody, even folks who never buy one. Studies have shown that asthma rates and other respiratory issues are very high in low-income communities and communities of color, and it's typically the emissions from vehicles, the emissions from transportation that drive that.

To the extent Chicago provides support for people transitioning to clean vehicles, provides infrastructure so that everybody, not just rich folks, but everybody can access clean vehicles, it's better for everyone. This ordinance means that new construction will be built with EV readiness. It will have an equivalent number of spaces to competitor cities like Atlanta, Seattle, and the like.

And that this will be done early in the process when new buildings are built, when it's cheaper. I used to build charging stations for Tesla. When you build when a building is going up, when you put these channels in, you put this equipment in early, it's relatively cheap.

When you put it in afterwards, it's really expensive. And so it's not just expensive for the developer, it's expensive for the runner, it's expensive for the owner, and it's expensive for everybody if these kinds of vehicles are harder to build. So I want to say thank you.

That's my time.

[Speaker 1] (20:12 - 20:13)
Thank you, sir. All right.

[Speaker 5] (20:14 - 20:18)
Next, David. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 15] (20:19 - 21:06)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My name is David Kolata. I'm the Executive Director of the Citizens Utility Board.

I won't repeat what Mark just said, except to say we strongly support the EV charging ordinance before you today. This is smart, progressive policy that will make Chicago a leader on transportation electrification issues. It will save consumers money.

It will be good for the environment. I'm here on behalf of not just the Citizens Utility Board, but I've provided statements from multiple members of the Clean Jobs Coalition, including Illinois Environmental Council, Respiratory Health Association, Sierra Club supports this. This has broad-based support among the NGO community.

We thank Alderman Riley and Alderman Martin for their leadership, and we urge an aye vote. Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (21:07 - 21:23)
Thank you, David. All right. Next, we're, for members of the council and the addendum, this is the smoke alarm ordinance.

We have two witnesses that would like to testify. First, J. Chris Richmond, and followed by Margaret Vaughn.

[Speaker 23] (21:28 - 23:38)
Good morning. Good morning. J.

Chris Richmond. I'm a recently retired fire marshal, city of Springfield, 25-year career in the fire service. Look, this is aimed, this 10-year standard for sealed battery smoke alarms is aimed at raising the minimum bar for smoke alarms in older housing stock.

I've seen it work in my community. I've seen it work nationwide. Look, we in the fire service, public safety, we go into homes with outcomes that are often horrible.

And what we see nationwide in the statistics, and I've seen it in my community, I'm sure it's the same here in Chicago, is all too often those batteries are missing in those smoke alarms. Forty percent of the time, they're not working as designed. What this does is raise that minimum bar.

It puts a sealed battery smoke alarm in place that changes those outcomes, those horrible outcomes that we see to much more positive outcomes. So I'm confident that this is, as long as it passes, this is going to save lives in this community. We've partnered and we've seen, I've written grants for the last six years for my department at both the federal level and I've partnered with the American Red Cross who has program.

The only alarms they're providing in their grant-funded programs are these sealed battery models because the technology is so much superior than the old school type where you can remove the battery. So again, I urge you to raise this minimum bar throughout the city, meet where we're at in the rest of the state, and have those outcomes that are more positive. I'm confident that it will save lives.

Thank you. Thank you very much.

[Speaker 14] (23:39 - 26:16)
Margaret Vaughn, I'm the government affairs director for the Illinois Firefighters Association and I work with Mr. Richmond to get this legislation passed in Springfield in 2017. To echo what he said about the Red Cross, they do have grant programs available through FEMA. They've installed in the communities across the country over 2 million alarms and from that they have 700 lives that have been saved directly.

So I know people take it for granted when they go to sleep at night that their smoke detector is going to work. We're finding that's not the case in the majority of fires. There's been 148 of them in the city of Chicago.

In the past five years, the majority of those are happening in homes without working smoke detectors, as we've seen so tragically with the 10 children that were killed in the Little Village fire. And just last week, there was a one-year-old baby that was killed in a West Lawn fire and it was the neighbors that were rushing in, screaming, are there any more babies inside? So we're here today to try to prevent that.

This is not a new mandate. Smoke detectors have been required since the 80s in all housing. This is really just for homes built after 1984.

The old school model with removable batteries only has a 10-year shelf life. So if your smoke detector has been sitting up there for 20 years, the manufacturer can't guarantee that it's going to work anyway. Dust accumulates on the sensory devices.

So this is not saying that you have to run out and put these 10-year smoke detectors in overnight. The law doesn't go into effect until 2023. Even at that time, if you still have the old school models that are not past their shelf life date, you can continue to use those.

So this is a phase in. There's plenty of grant money out there. The Red Cross, FEMA, the State Fire Marshal, they will provide you smoke detectors if they're installed, but it has to be that 10-year model.

Escape time is so critical because the content of modern homes with all the synthetic material is much more toxic. The fires are burning five times faster, five times hotter, and 200 times more toxic smoke. You take a couple deep breaths of that toxic smoke when you're in a deep sleep, that's what's leading to fatalities, not so much the burns.

If you do survive those burns, stay with you for the rest of your life, and you have to live with that. It's not like a broken leg. So today we're just trying to bring the rest of the city of Chicago up to par with Illinois, with Los Angeles, with New York.

In New York and Los Angeles, actually, the smoke detectors with the removable batteries, their sale is banned because they are so dangerous, because it leads to a false sense of security. So we'd appreciate any help. If there's any tweaks that need to be put into this, we'd be happy to work with you.

This law does not go into effect until 2023, so we'd be happy to do a follow-up trailer ordinance if that be the case to address anyone else's concerns. We appreciate your help and support today.

[Speaker 1] (26:17 - 26:49)
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.

All right. All right. Colleagues, bottom of page 11, we have Gene Paul Thomas come up, and the number is 20326 on the bottom of page 11.

Good morning. I'm Mike Litt.

[Speaker 37] (26:51 - 27:53)
Good morning. I'm John Paul Thomas, and I represent the 7400 South Wabash Block Club. We're here to talk about a classification change of an M2-1 to an M2-2 for crack cannabis grow.

I want to make it very clear that the property owners and the 7400 South Wabash Block Club is not opposed to the classification change. We are, however, opposed to the cannabis grow, so I want to make that perfectly clear. We're not opposed to personal use.

We are opposed to the cannabis grow, and we're opposed that way because there has been no communication from the owners of that business with the property holders. So we actually feel that the classification change may be more beneficial so we can attract different types of businesses to that location. It is simply the cannabis grow that we oppose.

Thank you.

[Speaker 6] (27:53 - 27:53)
Thank you.

[Speaker 28] (27:58 - 28:04)
Good morning, Chairman. It was my writing you couldn't read. It's Brendan Schiller.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, no. I know you're writing, Brendan.

[Speaker 1] (28:05 - 28:07)
We have not called you yet. Do we have Brendan?

[Speaker 28] (28:11 - 28:13)
It's for this project.

[Speaker 1] (28:17 - 28:22)
Are you here to talk about the bottom of page 11, 20326? Okay, hold on.

[Speaker 28] (28:25 - 28:29)
No, so my colleagues representing them, I'm here to speak publicly because I represent them not as a zoning court.

[Speaker 1] (28:29 - 28:35)
I didn't want to get your slip out because we didn't have it organized that way. All right, Brendan, proceed.

[Speaker 28] (28:35 - 30:15)
So to be clear, I represent them as writing their state application. They have a different zoning attorney. I showed up today to speak on their behalf because we got the message that they shouldn't be here, and we had an inkling that there may be some community opposition.

They held two community meetings, which their attorney will talk about, but really what I want to say since I wrote their state application and I've written over a dozen grow and craft grow applications, they have a highly competitive state application that will be using state of the art equipment to ensure that there's no impact environmentally on the community. More importantly, this is one of the handful of completely black and brown owned applications in the state, and if this city council is going to continue to push for social equity, this is a team that needs to have the opportunity to win at the state level, and they cannot win at the state level without this zoning change. They operate three other businesses in the community, 100% employees from the community, and while you're going to hear from their attorney that's actually representing them in a zoning manner, I want to speak in the public comment because like I said, I knew that you were going to hear some opposition.

I think if we're going to move forward on a controversial matter such as cannabis grows and really create the economic impact for black and brown communities that we need to create, we need to recognize that even when it's controversial, when we have good operators such as this, we need to approve the zoning. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (30:15 - 30:39)
Thank you, Brendan. All right, now the next two speakers are going to speak on the item on the top of page 15 and the application number is 20331. So we have Tamika Chivers and Robert Hudson.

They would come to the mic.

[Speaker 13] (30:57 - 33:52)
Good morning. I just want to say before I start, due to the situation that's going on right now, it would have been more of my colleagues here today, but due to the circumstances going on, they cannot be here. So good morning.

My name is Tamika Chivers. I live in the 27th Ward and I grew up in Cabrini Green. I was a junior in high school before the transition where we moved to the townhomes on Halsted and Division.

I lived there with my father until he passed away. I thought I would be able to stay there with my three children, but instead I had two weeks to find a new place to live. It was really scary and stressful trying to find an affordable housing option in that area.

I think Related Midwest can do better and provide more affordable housing at 725 West Randolph. I understand that the developer inherited the ability to build 220 of those units under the old affordability requirement, which is why they can do so few affordable units now. When I think about inheritance, I think of my father.

I was not able to inherit my father's house when he passed. There were no loopholes that helped me and my family. Instead, I had to leave the home where I grew up.

I had to fight to find an affordable place for me and my three sons. They are all under 15 and my oldest son Jason has Down Syndrome. There were moments where I was really scared.

I remember how desperate I felt calling through the list of possible places and there wasn't many options. I couldn't just move to another part of the city. I wanted my boys to be able to go to the same school and also I needed to be close to my sister who was also disabled and she relies on me for help too.

I was so lucky to find my current apartment. I know families who aren't as lucky as I was, but sometimes it feels like my family and I are not wanted on the near north and near west side, especially when the developer makes very few units in a new building affordable. The mess is always there.

They don't want people like me living there. We need more affordable housing options for everyone in all neighborhoods regardless of background or economic status. Everyone should be treated with respect and dignity regardless of how much you pay in rent.

I hope Related Midwest will make 20% of 370 units affordable and provide at least 37 units on site affordable. Every affordable housing unit makes a difference and it did for me and my family. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (33:54 - 33:55)
Next, Robert.

[Speaker 19] (34:07 - 36:44)
Good morning. My name is Robert Hudson. I'd like to just piggyback off of what Tamika said.

There would have been a lot more of us here today, but due to the current climate of the country, they could be here. Good morning. My name is Robert Hudson.

I live on the southwest side of Chicago. I'm here to ask Related Midwest to commit to making 20% of the 370 units at 725 West Randolph affordable for working people like me. I understand they inherited approvals years ago to build 220 units under the old affordability regulations, but it doesn't make it right.

The right thing is to honor the current affordability requirements for all 370 units. I work at the Marriott Marquis and I am a proud member of Unite Here, Local 1. I make $22 an hour as a cook and I pay zero a month for excellent health insurance, yet I still can't afford to live on my own.

Right now, I live with my father in his home that he owns in Auburn Gresham. I commute an hour and a half each way to work. I work hard and save money, but it's still so hard to find a decent place to live that is affordable in the city.

I love my job and I love this city, but sometimes I think I can't make it here. I have friends who have left the city of Chicago for cities like Atlanta, Houston, and St. Louis because they can't afford to live in the city. When I was in high school, three of my friends were killed in a drive-by shooting.

I don't want anyone to have that same experience, but it still happens to this very day. Growing up, I was told if I work hard and I get a good job, I can make it, but I feel like I'm doing all the right things and it's not enough to make it on my own. I think about young people growing up now.

What hope do they have? How are we going to help young black and brown men see that they have a future in this city? We need more good jobs and affordable housing so that young working people can live and work in safe neighborhoods.

Related Midwest wants to use a loophole to do the bare minimum on affordable housing on this project. I think that they can do better. Chicago deserves better.

I urge you to defer consideration on this project and close Related Midwest's inheritance loophole. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (36:45 - 37:13)
Thank you very much. All right, next item is going to be in the middle of page seven. While we deferred it, we do have a witness and if that person would like, who's in opposition, so if Joseph Lernahan would want to at least brief us a little bit, this will obviously come up again.

We'll probably hear you again or maybe not.

[Speaker 33] (37:34 - 37:44)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This item you mentioned, document 20350 is on your deferral list.

[Speaker 1] (37:45 - 37:50)
Yes, sir. It is? Yes, sir.

[Speaker 33] (37:50 - 37:57)
Okay, that means it's going to go back to planning. Well, they will consider it and it comes right back to you.

[Speaker 1] (37:57 - 38:11)
It will come back to a future zoning committee here. Okay, I'll speak then. I'll offer testimony.

But I know you came down, so I just want to give you that opportunity, but we'll see you again. Hopefully we'll not, maybe we'll get some progress.

[Speaker 33] (38:12 - 38:19)
Regardless of what happens at planning, past planning, it's coming back to you. Yes. Okay, I'll speak then.

[Speaker 1] (38:19 - 38:20)
Okay, thank you, sir.

[Speaker 33] (38:21 - 38:22)
Okay, thank you very much for the opportunity.

[Speaker 42] (38:23 - 38:28)
Okay, all right.

[Speaker 1] (38:36 - 39:02)
Okay, so let's, we've got two items or two witnesses, I should say, that call guaranteed investments. So I'm not, even though they both, 7401 South State. Do you want to, is Karen Shaw or Brett Berger?

If so, would you come to the mic?

[Speaker 24] (39:07 - 39:10)
So if that's okay, we'll wait for the zoning.

[Speaker 1] (39:11 - 39:12)
So you're a zoning attorney?

[Speaker 24] (39:12 - 39:13)
Yeah, we'll wait for that. Yes.

[Speaker 1] (39:14 - 40:20)
All right, we'll hear from you later. Okay, thank you. All right, so that concludes the public commentary portion of the meeting.

We'll now move on to the addendum to the agenda. We have three text amendments up today. We'll start with the one which is titled the second addendum to the agenda, the one page single item TAD-593, which is the amendment of Municipal Code Section 13-64-150 to further regulate standards for installation of smoke alarms and smoke detectors.

Before we get to the testimony, this item does have a substitute. Do I hear a motion to accept the substitute? Alderman Riley moves to accept the substitute.

All those in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed?

Hearing none, the substitute is accepted and we have our colleague, esteemed colleague, Alderman Villegas and Commissioner Freeland here to testify on the matter.

[Speaker 16] (40:21 - 40:21)
Who wants to?

[Speaker 1] (40:22 - 40:22)
Alderman?

[Speaker 16] (40:23 - 41:06)
Thank you, Chairman. We have Commissioner Freeland who will also give a presentation from the Department of Buildings. So colleagues, in the past five years, there have been 148 residential fires deaths in Chicago.

The majority of these deaths occurred in dwellings without working smoke detectors. In 2017, the Illinois legislator passed a law requiring the 10-year sealed smoke detectors to be used in dwellings by 2023, but Chicago was exempted. And so all this does is just basically bring Chicago into compliance with the rest of the state, similar to Naperville, Evanston, etc.

So all this does is just update the code with the new technology.

[Speaker 1] (41:07 - 41:10)
All right. Commissioner? Good morning.

[Speaker 7] (41:10 - 42:39)
Good morning. Judy Freeland, Building Commissioner, City of Chicago. Thank you for hearing us this morning with everything going on, but smoke detectors, as you know, save lives, and we're happy to be here to discuss this with you today.

The first thing I want to make really clear about this is that this only affects your classic battery-operated smoke detector that many people have in their homes and apartments. This does not affect anything that's hardwired, like, you know, in nursing homes or hospitals or anything like that. It's just your classic smoke detector that you usually use the 9-volt battery in.

And we are not abolishing these current smoke detectors. We're just saying that after their 10- year lifespan is over, you should switch to the new 10-year smoke detector that has the battery that lasts 10 years with it. And the nice thing about these new smoke detectors is that if it goes off while you're cooking, you can just push a delay button and it'll stop for 10 minutes and then reactivate itself automatically so that a lot of people take out their batteries from the smoke detectors when they're cooking and don't put it back, and that's when you get a lot of tragedy.

So this does not take effect until 2023. Your current battery-operated smoke alarm lasts for about 10 years, so the fire department will still be passing out the current smoke detectors for the next couple of years. People will still be able to use them, but when the 10-year expires on the current one then they would replace it with the new one.

[Speaker 1] (42:41 - 42:44)
Questions from committee members? Alderman Deal.

[Speaker 9] (42:46 - 42:51)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Commissioner, is the Chicago Fire Department in support of this ordinance?

[Speaker 7] (42:53 - 43:29)
The Chicago Fire Department is concerned that they will still be able to pass out the smoke detectors that they currently have in stock and that people won't have to take theirs out and have another expense and they will not have to do that. So the fire department can still pass these out till 2023 and they can still be used for 10 years and people do not have to remove their current smoke detector, they can just take it out when it's the end of its life, which is 10 years on the regular ones as well. So those were their concerns about the smoke detectors as I understand it, and so they can still continue to do what they're doing, which is very important.

[Speaker 9] (43:30 - 43:39)
Okay, that was a great answer. However, you did not answer my question. Is the Chicago Fire Department in support of this ordinance, yes or no?

[Speaker 7] (43:40 - 43:50)
You would have to, I mean, it's my understanding that those were their concerns and that this responded to those concerns, but other than that, I just, I can't answer that.

[Speaker 9] (43:50 - 45:42)
Okay, well I'm gonna answer it for you. The Chicago Fire Department is not in support of this ordinance. If they were in support of this ordinance, I think you would have overwhelming support from this body.

But when we have to take the lead, as we do every day from the Chicago Fire Department, who is in the business of saving lives, say that this is going to put an undue burden on residents and they do not support this ordinance. Now, whether the battery lasts two years or 10 years, if you're asking somebody to remember that their battery is going to be dead in 10 years and they can't remember in two years, it's a reason why we say daylight saving times, check your battery, check your battery, check your battery, daylight saving times, check your battery. Now we're going to say don't check it for 10 years.

Now you're asking seniors to remember 10 years down the road to change or check their battery when we have for years embedded in people. Daylight saving time, check your battery. Now, you know, and that's one of the reasons why, you know, I'm opposed to it, that's number one.

Number two is the undue financial burden when we're trying to ask our seniors and everybody else to cut back on resources and now we're about to add another burden on to them and they can't afford their prescription drugs, they can't afford their groceries, they can't afford to do different things and now we're going to ask them to pay a little bit more for a smoke detector. I think that's just unrealistic at this time. Now, we're all in the business of saving lives.

Let me just go on the record. We're all in the business of making sure that safety and the well-being of the people is first and foremost in the city, but to put this burden on people right now at this particular time is an undue burden, especially when the Chicago Fire Department says they don't support this order. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (45:42 - 45:46)
Thank you, Alderman. I think Alderman Villegas would like to say, make a comment at this point.

[Speaker 16] (45:46 - 46:03)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. To my colleague's question regarding the reminding of seniors, so these alarms, given the upgraded technology, when they're about to expire, it actually gives a voice alarm that says the alarm is about to expire, you need to get a new one.

[Speaker 1] (46:04 - 46:06)
Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 17] (46:11 - 46:44)
Thank you, Chairman. Good morning, members. I too have concerns about this and I join my colleague also in recognizing that the Fire Department does not support this.

I, unfortunately, have had to deal with a number of fires in my ward, in no small part because of the financial burdens placed on residents who are already struggling. Asking them now to rewire by 2023 is not realistic.

[Speaker 1] (46:44 - 46:49)
I don't think there's, I don't think rewiring was the comment by our committee.

[Speaker 17] (46:49 - 46:56)
So then in 2023, if someone can clarify then, what happens if they haven't had the switch?

[Speaker 1] (46:56 - 46:57)
Great. Okay.

[Speaker 7] (46:57 - 47:47)
Thank you. You know, the Building Department supports this ordinance along with Mayor Lightfoot and the Mayor's office because it is a much safer system and we're not saying that people have to take out their current smoke detectors at all and that's not a matter of rewiring. So the current smoke detectors that people have are good for the life of that smoke detector.

So if you put in a new smoke detector in your home in December of 2022 before this ordinance goes into effect, you can keep your old smoke detector until 2032 and then in 2032 when it's time to upgrade your current smoke detector that you're changing the batteries for, at that time you would install a smoke detector with the 10-year battery in it. So that's not a matter of rewiring. It's attached to your home the very same way that a regular smoke detector is.

Great. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (47:48 - 47:49)
Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 17] (47:53 - 48:03)
The Fire Department already gives out smoke detectors. The smoke detectors that they give out do not fit this qualification. Is that correct?

[Speaker 7] (48:04 - 48:12)
That is correct, but they can continue to give those out for the next three years and they'll still be good for 10 years after that.

[Speaker 17] (48:13 - 48:15)
What happens after three years?

[Speaker 7] (48:16 - 48:20)
After three years, we will start passing out the new 10-year smoke detectors.

[Speaker 17] (48:23 - 50:10)
Now as many of my colleagues know and I've brought this up two budgets in a row, the amount of money that we spend on free smoke detectors to our residents is abysmal. The fact that we have a contract for these smoke detectors that we purchase to give out that charges the city $5 for a $2 smoke detector is something that I've raised alarms for for the past two years. These detectors will cost significantly more and will already strain the amount of resources that we allocate in terms of helping individuals who don't have smoke detectors, who rely on the free smoke detectors from the City of Chicago.

What I haven't heard to join this conversation is any kind of increased funding effort or outreach to ensure that we are able to maintain the level of support free support to our residents using the new smoke detectors and in particular many of the smoke detectors that we give are not just paid for by the city by taxpayers. Overwhelmingly the number of smoke detectors we give out are based on donations and in cooperation with various organizations and businesses and now we're going to be asking them as well to make a decision as to whether or not they are either a going to maintain their funding levels as they are but diminish the number of free items that we're able to give or ask them to absorb more than doubling or tripling of the cost in order to meet the same level of assistance that we've been providing to date.

[Speaker 1] (50:11 - 50:15)
I think Chairman Villegas wants to comment a little bit on that.

[Speaker 16] (50:16 - 50:47)
Thank you Chairman thank you Alderman. The current smoke detectors that the fire department passes out if they were to switch to the tenure would allow for the City of Chicago to apply for grants from KIDA as well as from the American Red Cross which would not only allow for the distribution of free smoke detectors but also for the installation so that way making sure that these smoke detectors are done that are actually passed out or actually installed and not just sitting on someone's table because they've gotten a free device.

[Speaker 1] (50:48 - 50:54)
All right I'm going to ask Alderman Moore you had your hand up.

[Speaker 6] (50:55 - 51:59)
Thank you Chairman so an effort not to just be repetitive I'm standing support with what my colleagues are saying in regards to the position of the fire department. One of the things that I think we all yes are in the business of keeping people safe but again the fire department they're ultimately responsible in this manner and as much as I want to support this ordinance because I have no doubt that the mayor in supporting this wants to do the right thing it's very important for me as well that the leadership that she's put in place and the subject matter experts because I'm not the expert they are the experts that I have to listen to and so I'm hoping that we can get together and come to some type of agreement where the fire is in support and all their questions are answered because neither one of them leadership or members from our fire department are here today so I'm making a motion that we hold this item until that such time.

[Speaker 1] (51:59 - 52:05)
I'm going to ask Alderman Riley he has a question before we take that.

[Speaker 5] (52:08 - 53:06)
Thank you Chairman I just had one question it's been raised in debate I guess would be for buildings. Commissioner what would the cost differential be between the current supply that the fire department is distributing versus what we think would be a reasonable wholesale cost for the city and for fire to acquire the new technology moving forward once this 10-year period expires on the existing devices is and again I'm asking I guess for today's cost but I suspect as the current devices expire over the next 10 years that technology would likely evolve and hopefully would see the price come down but I just want to get a sense you know today apples to apples what that might look like for the average person who doesn't perhaps get a free device from the city.

[Speaker 7] (53:06 - 53:30)
Of course so we have some prices Menards has one for about $13 Walmart has one for just under $14 and then there's a slightly enhanced one sold by Home Depot that's selling now for $16 and note that you will not have to buy the batteries and change them for 10 years so it'll be that price for the full 10 years.

[Speaker 5] (53:30 - 53:32)
Got it and so and that's retail.

[Speaker 7] (53:33 - 53:33)
Yes.

[Speaker 5] (53:33 - 53:54)
And so I'm because I'm not familiar at all with how the city currently I know a lot of the the current supply that we distribute is donated from large retailers or the companies themselves but do we also purchase these devices and I guess do we have a sense of what the wholesale cost for these new devices might be to the city?

[Speaker 7] (53:54 - 54:53)
Yes we've been meeting regularly with procurement and we've been working and asking the fire department about how many they pass out every year and so we are working to also ask about donations and get these prices down so we're in the midst of all that. Like I said we don't have to pass these out till 2023 we have a long lead-in period for this so we can continue to pass out the volume that we have and just as a note is New York City went to the system a few years ago and you know they have it posted on their website you can go to their website about it and it just explains that at the end of the life of your current smoke detector not the battery but the current smoke detector that you purchase the 10-year one but in the meantime please change your batteries and continue to use them so this is not yanking out every smoke detector out of everybody's homes this is a very gradual way to go through the updated technology.

[Speaker 5] (54:53 - 55:09)
And so even for those folks who for whatever reason really really like their current device right before 2023 they could elect to go out and purchase one of these current devices to add another 10 years of battery swapping?

[Speaker 1] (55:09 - 55:09)
Yes.

[Speaker 5] (55:09 - 55:12)
Yeah okay all right thank you that's that's helpful thank you chairman.

[Speaker 1] (55:13 - 55:32)
All right let me go back to Alderman David Moore. David are you asking to defer this what are you are you are you just questioning out loud? Do you want to hold the item?

Let me let me ask my sponsor Alderman Villegas if you're okay with that.

[Speaker 16] (55:34 - 56:03)
With all due respect my colleague from the 17th ward I want to move forward with it and I would also add that as the commissioner mentioned regarding the fire department's position it's related specifically to the ability to pass out smoke detectors that was their main concern and so if that's a big concern we can definitely take a look at working with them and making sure that they have sufficient smoke detectors to pass out that comply with the new technology.

[Speaker 1] (56:05 - 56:29)
Great hold on yes Alderman Beal I think we well you're let me just before I get to Alderman Beal you're asking to hold and you're asking not to hold. Okay so we do a roll call on that what on the motion to defer okay so let's let's do that. To clarify?

Unless there's a question about about procedure.

[Speaker 9] (56:31 - 57:10)
Before we take a vote to defer or not to defer Mr. Chairman I think it's just important that we just hear from the fire department. I think it's unjust for us to be having a hearing on smoke detectors and the fire department is not even here and it's a reason why they're not here is because you know they're not in support of it and so I would just you know yield to the chairman of this ordinance to wait and just hold it if we're not in a in a hurry until 2023 we're not in a hurry to pass something that our fire department is not in support of so I just ask that you just hold this until we hear from the fire department before we take a vote.

[Speaker 1] (57:10 - 57:17)
You were very strong about that in your testimony. Chairman Villegas do we roll call?

[Speaker 16] (57:18 - 57:21)
Well you need a second first chairman in order for the deferral.

[Speaker 1] (57:22 - 57:28)
Well okay so we have a second but we're doing the roll call about whether we're holding this or not.

[Speaker 18] (57:29 - 58:46)
To clarify a yay vote is a vote to defer the item. Alderman Roboyos, Alderman Hopkins, Alderman Dowell, Alderman Sawyer, Alderman Beal, Alderman Lopez, Alderman Moore, Alderman Rodriguez, Alderman Siccio Lopez, Alderman Burnett, Alderman Cardona, Alderman Wagesbeck, Alderman Austin, Alderman Villegas, Alderman Riley, Alderman Kappelman, Alderman Osterman, Alderman Hadden, Chairman Tunney. No okay we have to happen I can't say no okay okay so we have one two three four five six seven seven no's four yeas.

[Speaker 1] (58:51 - 59:09)
Okay so the motion is defeated on a what is it eight no's and four ayes. All right so we're going to have so we're going to ask for a motion to pass this ordinance I believe right? As amended.

As amended. Chairman Villegas can you make that motion?

[Speaker 16] (59:09 - 59:11)
Mr. Chairman I make a motion to pass as amended.

[Speaker 1] (59:12 - 59:25)
Do we have a second on it? All those in favor? Roll call.

Okay we'll do a roll call. Okay we'll start over again on the roll call. Explain what a yay and a nay is.

[Speaker 18] (59:25 - 1:00:17)
To clarify a yay vote will be vote to pass as amended. Chairman Raboeris, Alderman Hopkins, Alderman Dowell, Alderman Sawyer, Alderman Beal, Alderman Lopez, Alderman Moore, Alderman Rodriguez, Alderman Siccio Lopez, Alderman Burnett, Alderman Cardona, Alderman Wagesbeck, Alderman Austin, Alderman Villegas, Alderman Riley, Alderman Kappelman, Alderman Osterman, Alderman Hadden, Chairman Tunney. Okay one two nine yeas three.

[Speaker 1] (1:00:17 - 1:00:27)
Okay nine yeas three negatives the ordinance is passed out of committee. Thank you. Are you staying around for the election?

[Speaker 42] (1:00:27 - 1:00:28)
No.

[Speaker 1] (1:00:28 - 1:00:31)
Oh okay thank you.

[Speaker 18] (1:00:33 - 1:00:44)
All right now we're on.

[Speaker 1] (1:00:48 - 1:01:40)
Let's go to the addendum on the of the agenda TAD-590 this is an amendment of the municipal code chapters 1710 and 1717 by adding new sections 1710-1011 and 17-17-0251.5 concerning electric vehicles and electric vehicle supply equipment. Before we get to the testimony we do have a substitute. Do I hear a motion to accept the substitute?

Alderman Riley moves to accept the substitute. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Can you share the ayes have it? The substitute is before us.

I think we're going to have Alderman Riley and Deputy Commissioner Grant Ulrich from the Department of Buildings to testify on this matter. Alderman.

[Speaker 5] (1:01:41 - 1:05:49)
Thank you Chairman. I want to thank you and my colleagues for revisiting the city's policy on electric vehicle supply equipment. As you recall a few months ago this committee approved an ordinance that would require for new construction only the essentially the guts of the equipment required for the future installation of electric vehicle charging equipment to be built into garage structures for multi-unit homes.

And the great benefit of this is that by doing this in new construction it is much much much more affordable than trying to go and retrofit an existing building. And when you look at the trend in electric vehicle sales we're seeing those rapidly increase. There are projections that by 2040 alone 55% of all new car sales will be electric vehicles.

They're predicting that 16% of Americans would purchase an EV as their next vehicle. And in six years the cost of an EV is projected to be equal to the cost of a fossil fuel vehicle. And so having an ordinance that requires EV readiness in our new garage structures just for a percentage of those parking stalls can have some significant savings for the future costs of supply equipment.

Basically it's six times more expensive to retrofit a building than it is to install this on the front end. EV ready allows future owners or tenants to easily install electric vehicle supply equipment when desired and it encourages additional EV sales. And then why now?

Many buildings constructed now will be in service when electric vehicles are projected to be a significant part of market share between 2030 and 2040. And so I want to thank the administration for working with Alderman Martin and myself and others to come up with a I guess generation 2.0 of the EV ordinance that we passed a few months ago. There are a number of organizations that support the ordinance.

We heard earlier during public testimony from the Citizens Utility Board and the NRDC. I believe the Illinois Environmental Council supports this. Not surprising Tesla supports this.

And then of course the Building Trades and the IBW Local 130 have also filed slips in support of this ordinance. We have written testimony from the Respiratory Health Association in support as well. And I believe members of committee have that written testimony before you.

But to be clear what this new ordinance would do is it would apply to all new residential buildings with five or more units or new commercial property new commercial properties with 30 or more parking spaces. And it would require 20 percent of any supplied parking spaces be EV ready and at least one of those EV ready spaces be available accessible to people with disabilities. And we would impose a three-month delay from implementation from July 31st moving it back to October 31st 2020 to provide some flexibility for the development community as well.

But this is a progressive ordinance that would land the city of Chicago at the top of all cities in North America when it comes to planning for the future of electric vehicles. It's coming whether you like it or not. And the great news is that it's got tremendous benefits for the environment and weans us off our dependence on fossil fuels which is good public policy both locally and internationally.

So that said we do have experts from the department as well as subject matter experts from those organizations I mentioned who'd be happy to answer any of the more technical questions. Thank you chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:05:50 - 1:06:01)
Thank you Alderman and I know you have been pushing this initiative for a fairly long time so congratulations. Deputy Commissioner Grant Ulrich would you like to expound?

[Speaker 36] (1:06:02 - 1:06:33)
Good morning chairman. I think that the sponsor and the public speakers have done a good job of explaining what's in this ordinance in the substitute package. I do want to thank Alderman Riley and Alderman Martin for continuing to push this and work with us to get this version 2.0 before it goes into effect so I think it's going to be a good package. We also had the department planning and development and CDOT work closely on this as it's a issue that crosses a number of departments so I'm happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (1:06:33 - 1:06:39)
Okay questions from committee members on this ordinance? Alderman Rodriguez.

[Speaker 11] (1:06:41 - 1:07:21)
No questions just wanted to raise my voice and congratulate the sponsors on this laudable effort both Alderman Riley and Martin. This is an important step. We need to continue to think holistically about how we as a city are fitting out our infrastructure to be more much more in line with best practices in and in supporting the health of our environment and in supporting the health of our city particularly given where we're at right now with the coronavirus and other health issues we need to be moving forward many more of these types of efforts so once again congratulations Alderman Riley and Alderman Martin. Other questions and comments Alderman Villegas.

[Speaker 16] (1:07:22 - 1:07:39)
Thank you Mr. Chairman I just wanted to also congratulate my colleague for this forward-thinking investment in technology it's it's here and so we got to continue to be adaptive and as these new technologies do come online be flexible as a city so great job.

[Speaker 1] (1:07:40 - 1:07:57)
Okay no more questions or comments do I have a motion to pass as amended on this ordinance? Alderman Hopkins moves to pass on the ordinance. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? Senior Chair the ayes have it and this item is passed as amended.

[Speaker 5] (1:07:57 - 1:07:58)
Thank you chairman thank you colleagues.

[Speaker 1] (1:07:59 - 1:08:42)
All right next up you're gonna be up here pretty soon next up is TAD-592 amendment of this Chicago sustainable development policy to prioritize bird collision deterrence strategies for building projects to reduce avian mortality and injury. This is on the addendum okay on the addended agenda. So Alderman Hopkins I know this issue is very important to all of us but can you lead us on this one please?

[Speaker 22] (1:08:42 - 1:08:45)
Yeah it is I really do hope this ordinance will fly.

[Speaker 1] (1:08:47 - 1:08:50)
Okay is that your testimony?

[Speaker 22] (1:08:50 - 1:10:41)
No I'll elaborate a little bit more this is actually a much more practical version of a more detailed ordinance that includes some significant changes to the building code that is pending. We'll deal with that later this is actually to codify a practice that we're already doing. When a developer sits down with their intake meeting with the Department of Planning and they meet with the sustainability staff they're presented with options and they're told that there's things they can do to incorporate bird-friendly design into the structure.

We know the types of buildings that tend to not be collision magnets for birds and one example that I'll cite is is Aqua a building that has a contrast built into the design that uses materials that are not translucent that do not appear to migrating birds to be something they could fly through. On the opposite end of that spectrum is McCormick Place on the lakefront which is a dark structure especially at night it's one of the top impact points for migrating birds anywhere in the city. So between those two extremes there's a lot of design features that a developer can incorporate to minimize the likelihood that migrating birds will die from a collision with the building and the building department and the planning department present these options encourage developers to voluntarily in most cases comply and cooperate with them and they're currently doing so.

So all this does right now is to lead the way to a future discussion that we'll have with a more comprehensive amendment to the zoning code as we get a little bit more experience in that bird-friendly design and I believe the building department is prepared to testify in support of this and hopefully someone from planning is here also.

[Speaker 1] (1:10:41 - 1:11:00)
Okay before we get into questions Deputy Commissioner Grant Albrecht are you coming down here? Okay so both of you are going to say a few words why don't you introduce yourself and we'll start with you and then we'll go to Grant.

[Speaker 20] (1:11:02 - 1:12:48)
Good morning my name is Michael Berkshire with the Department of Planning and Development and I just have a few words to say about this proposed ordinance. The City of Chicago lies within a significant bird migratory flyway in the United States. Each year thousands of birds are injured or killed in Chicago by colliding into buildings with certain lighting techniques and glass facades that confuse and attract migrating birds.

The purpose of this ordinance is to reduce these fatal collisions by prioritizing bird collision deterrent strategies and projects that are subject to the Chicago Sustainable Development Policy. The policy has been continuously implemented since 2004 and was updated in 2017 to provide a menu item of sustainable strategies that projects can choose from to meet the policy requirements. This menu includes bird-friendly strategies.

Each strategy has a number of points associated with them and new construction projects must achieve 100 points and renovation projects must achieve 25 or 50 points depending on the depth of the renovation. To date only a few projects have implemented bird-friendly strategies. Under this ordinance the Department of Planning and Development will reconvene the group of experts that helped update the policy in 2017 to consider improvements in the policy to prioritize bird collision deterrent strategies.

The improvements may include increasing the points associated with bird-friendly strategies and or making these strategies mandatory for projects that are located in the downtown zoning districts near the lake and river system and adjacent to large regional parks. This update to the policy will be completed in 2026.

[Speaker 1] (1:12:50 - 1:12:52)
Good morning again.

[Speaker 36] (1:12:53 - 1:13:23)
I just want to thank Alderman Hopkins for working with us so he does have a broader proposal and we encourage that we do a little bit more data gathering working through the Sustainable Development Policy for some of these larger projects or projects with city funding to get more information about what is cost-effective in our region and our construction market before we go ahead with broader amendments to the building code.

So I appreciate that flexibility that I think this is going to be a good experience.

[Speaker 1] (1:13:24 - 1:15:18)
Thank you Grant. Questions for either the Alderman or the departments? Hearing none can I have a motion to pass on this ordinance?

Moved by Viega, second by Cardona. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? I'm sure the ayes have it and this item is passed and reported out. Thank you very much.

All right. Now we're moving to large signs over 100 square feet in area 24 feet above grade. We will hear them all together and I'll read the ward followed by the address and take a motion at the end.

Okay, so a little bit different on this today. There are a couple of signs that we're going to ask for a do not pass on this agenda and I will, do we take the do not pass first? Okay.

So these items I'm recommending do not pass. We have heard from the Aldermen's in each ward and they are comfortable with do not pass. So it's not like something we're not doing without transparency and the support of the Alderman.

So the first item is in the second ward, 105 West Chicago with the document number OR2020-44 and the second item that I'm asking for do not pass will be in the 20th ward that's 5917 through 5927 South Wentworth Avenue with the document number of OR2020-45. So do I hear a motion do not pass? Alderman Hadden makes the motion of do not pass on those, I'm sorry.

[Speaker 22] (1:15:18 - 1:15:32)
For the record the matter in the second ward, it's my understanding that there's a defect in the application. So it's our intention to resubmit and repair it and I just wanted to put that on the record. We'll correct that and bring it back.

We'll be back.

[Speaker 42] (1:15:33 - 1:15:33)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:15:34 - 1:16:23)
So Alderman Hadden makes the motion do not pass on these two items. All those in favor of do not pass say aye. Any opposed to that?

The ayes have it and these two items will not be moved for passage at this time. All right. So staying with these two items the clerk's office has now reassigned them tracking numbers.

OR2020-45 has been reclassified as 02020-706 and item OR2020-44 has been reclassified as 02020-897.

[Speaker 13] (1:16:24 - 1:16:27)
For the record. All right. Back to regular business.

[Speaker 1] (1:16:28 - 1:19:13)
So now we're on to regular business and these again are signs that we're going to ask for a motion at the end and I will read the ward and the address and then ask for that motion. So we'll start in the 45th ward at 4612 West Irving Park Road. Also in the 45th ward 3925 North Cicero.

In the 44th ward we have four signs at 3519 North Clark Street. In the 44th ward three signs at 3301 North Ashland Avenue. In the 44th ward two signs at 2868 North Broadway.

And finally in the 44th ward four more signs at 3519 North Clark Street. Moving to the 42nd ward at 320 West Ohio Street. In the 42nd ward 159 East Ohio Street.

In the 42nd ward three signs at 25 East Ohio Street. In the 41st ward 11601 West Avenue. In the 39th ward 6375 North Milwaukee Avenue.

In the 27th ward 333 North Green Street. In the 25th ward 500 West 18th Street. In the 13th ward 4014 West 59th Street.

Now we're on the next page. In the 11th ward we have three signs at 2201 South Halstead Street. In the 11th ward two signs at 635 West Roosevelt Avenue.

And lastly in the second ward two signs at 1400 West Fullerton. Questions from committee members? Hearing none can I have a motion to pass on the orders?

Alderman Kappelman moves to pass on the orders. All those in favor, aye. Any opposed?

Opinion Chair the ayes have it. The orders will be passed and reported out Wednesday at the City Council. Now on the addendum the last item we have two historical landmark designations.

Document number 020, I'm sorry say it again, 02020-743 in the 42nd ward for the historical landmark designation for Chicago and Northwestern Railway office building located at 226 West Jackson Boulevard. So we have a statement from DPD. Diana are you coming down?

[Speaker 18] (1:19:14 - 1:19:18)
We all like to hear Diana.

[Speaker 1] (1:19:20 - 1:19:28)
So articulate. And then do we have a something to read in the record for Kleiber or we just add it?

[Speaker 18] (1:19:28 - 1:19:30)
Yeah the testimony will suffice.

[Speaker 1] (1:19:30 - 1:19:32)
All right. Good morning.

[Speaker 8] (1:19:35 - 1:21:47)
Good morning Chairman. My name is Diana Cavallo. I'm with the Department of Planning and Development.

I'm here today with a proposed ordinance for the landmark designation of the Chicago and Northwestern Railway office building. The building located at 226 West Jackson Boulevard in the Loop community area and 42nd ward was designed by the Chicago firm of Frost and Granger and completed in 1905. The 14-story classical revival style served as the headquarters for the Chicago and Northwestern Railway.

The building's current owner has consented to the landmark designation. At its February 2020 meeting, the Commission on Chicago Landmarks voted in favor of landmark designation for the building, finding that it meets three criteria for designation. Specifically, criterion one for heritage as the CNW Railway grew into the most extensive Midwestern Railroad company headquartered in Chicago in the early 20th century.

Criterion four for architecture as the CNW building is a fine example of the classical revival style within the framework of the commercial steel-framed skyscraper and criterion five for significant architect as the building was designed by Frost and Granger who are well known for designing railroad office buildings, stations, and terminals for various railroad companies including the now demolished Chicago and Northwestern Terminal of 1911 on Madison Street between Canal and Clinton Streets as well as the now demolished LaSalle Street Station which was built in 1903 and stood on Van Buren Street at LaSalle. Frost and Granger also designed the five-story office and banking hall for the Northern Trust Company which was completed in 1905 at 50 South LaSalle Street and is still standing today. The proposed designation recommends the significant historical and architectural features of the building be identified as all exterior elevations including roof lines.

Thank you. Thank you, Deanna. Questions from committee members?

[Speaker 1] (1:21:49 - 1:22:36)
Hearing none, I have a motion to move on this ordinance. Alderman Riley moves to pass on the ordinance. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? Opinion Chair, the ayes have it and this will be reported out on Wednesday.

Thank you, Deanna. All right, we have while you're here I guess we do have a another item and I'll read it into the record is document number 02020-742 in the third ward for the historical landmark designation of Mount Pisgah, do I get that right? Okay, Missionary Baptist Church complex at 4600-4628 South Dr. Martin Luther King Drive. Deanna, would you like to testify on this for the record?

[Speaker 8] (1:22:36 - 1:24:59)
Thank you, Chairman. Again, Deanna Covallo with Department of Planning and Development. The ordinance in front of you is for the landmark designation of the Mount Pisgah Missionary Baptist Church complex.

The complex located at 4600 South Dr. Martin Luther King Drive in the Bronzeville neighborhood and third ward was originally designed as a synagogue and social settlement house and completed in 1912. The current owner of the complex, Mount Pisgah Missionary Baptist Church, acquired the property in 1962 and has consented to the landmark designation. At its January 2020 meeting, the Commission on Chicago Landmarks voted in favor of landmark designation for the complex, finding that it meets four criteria for designation.

Specifically, it meets criterion one for heritage for its role as a center for community, religion, culture, and society in the Bronzeville neighborhood for the past 107 years. Criterion three for its identification with significant persons, including Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who on August 27, 1967, gave a sermon at Mount Pisgah and an earlier era, Eleanor Roosevelt, who offered a glimpse into a day of in the president's life at the complex. Criterion four for exemplary architecture as the Mount Pisgah complex is an example of neoclassical architectural style and criterion five as an example of the work of a significant architect, Alfred Allshore, who completed nearly 1,800 commissions between 1908 and 1939, including some of the city's most northwardly buildings, including the London Guarantee and Exchange Building, KAM Isa Israel Temple, and the Goldblatt Brothers Department Store, all designated Chicago landmarks. The proposed designation recommends that the significant historical and architectural features of the complex be identified as all exterior elevations, including roof lines of the complex, and the interior of the entrance lobby, sanctuary, and balcony of the former synagogue, with a few minor exceptions, as are detailed in the ordinance.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:24:59 - 1:26:27)
Thank you, Deanna. Questions from committee members on this beautiful structure? 107 years old.

Originally a synagogue, is that what you said? Okay. Any questions?

Hearing none, can I have a motion to move to pass? Alderman Maria Haddon moves to pass on the ordinance. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? Opinion Chair, the ayes have it, and this will be reported out on Wednesday.

Thank you, Deanna. All right. All right.

Now we're going to, we're on to the top of page two, document number 8508 in the 47th and 40th wards. Ordinance was referred on October 16th of 19. Change request is to classify a segment of the North Clark Street right-of-way from the center line of West Lawrence Avenue on the south, and the center line of West Ainslie Avenue on the north, and a segment of North Clark Street right-of-way from the center line of West Argyle on the south, and the center line of West Winona on the north as a pedestrian street.

I know that neither of the sponsors are here in person, but is this a joint letter?

[Speaker 14] (1:26:28 - 1:26:28)
Yep.

[Speaker 1] (1:26:28 - 1:28:42)
Okay. So quickly, I will read Alderman Matt Martin's letter to our committee, and I'm writing to ask for the committee support to extend the pedestrian designations on Clark Street to the stretches between Lawrence and Ainslie and between Argyle and Winona. This is being proposed in coordination with Alderman Vasquez.

We believe that closing these gaps to ensure that Clark Street bears this designation continuously from Montrose to Bryn Mawr will support a more uniform development pattern as the Clark Street retail corridor flourishes and economic activity spreads south of Foster. We are confident that this proposal will ensure that all new developments and businesses contribute to the valuable pedestrian friendly nature of Clark Street. So both sponsors obviously are in full support of expanding this pedestrian street.

Any questions? If not, do I have a motion? Alderman Kaplan moves to pass on this item.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

Thank you. Any opposed? Continue in the chair.

So hold on a second. No, no, no. Hold on.

All those in favor say aye. Any opposed? Continue in the chair.

The ayes have it and this item is passed. Sir, I understand you're in support. We had the witness testimony in the beginning of the meeting, but it sounds like you're for it.

All right. Moving on. Next on page two, item number A8516, 11th Ward, ordinance referred on January 15th of this year.

The common address 810 West 31st Street and the change request, a C11 neighborhood commercial district to a B11 neighborhood shopping district. And we will ask Alderman Thompson to speak on it. Alderman.

[Speaker 4] (1:28:43 - 1:29:57)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It's actually the next six items. I know we need to take each of these, but I am the applicant on the next six items.

These are items where we're changing the zoning district from a C to a B neighborhood shopping district to be consistent with what we've been doing systematically along the way, excuse me, along the way on Halston Street on 31st, on 35th. So we've been systematically doing that. And so I would ask that we support the only question actually, Mr. Chairman is on number A-8518, that we not include that in my presentation as that is the ward office building that is owned by the 11th Ward Democratic Party. We're changing the zoning from C to B.

[Speaker 1] (1:29:57 - 1:30:00)
Alderman, we're staying on 8516. Oh, I'm sorry.

[Speaker 4] (1:30:01 - 1:30:27)
Oh, we have to take it off. Okay. So the comment is the same.

We're changing this. You'll see it's consistent with C to B in each of these matters to be consistent with what the overall planning is. And it's been successful so far in changing it to B districts that are consistent with the community.

So I'd ask for a favorable approval on this matter.

[Speaker 1] (1:30:28 - 1:31:45)
Okay. Questions for the Alderman on 8516? Any questions?

Do I have a motion to move to pass on this item? Alderman Villegas moves to pass on the item. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? The Chair, the ayes have it.

And now we'll move on to document number A-8517. Again, the 11th Ward ordinance was referred on January 15th of 20. And this common address is 828 through 838 West 31st Street.

My understanding we have a substitute on this item and I have a motion to move on the substitute. Alderman Ravoyos moves on the substitute. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? Hearing none, the substitute is in front of us.

Alderman, would you like to comment on this one? Ditto. Ditto.

What I said earlier for these matters. All right. So can I get a motion on this item?

Alderman Riley moves to this item as substituted. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Continuing the Chair, the item is passed with the substitute accepted. All right.

Now what do we have? Okay.

[Speaker 14] (1:31:45 - 1:31:45)
Okay.

[Speaker 42] (1:31:47 - 1:31:47)
Right.

[Speaker 1] (1:31:47 - 1:32:11)
Okay. Fine. So I'll read the next item.

Again, the 11th Ward. Aldermanic item number 8518. This address is 3615 to 3659 South Halsted Street.

And the change request again, C12 Neighborhood Commercial District to a B11 Neighborhood Shopping District. And Alderman, I believe you're going to recuse yourself on this item?

[Speaker 4] (1:32:12 - 1:32:13)
Yes. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:32:14 - 1:33:43)
So you will not be testifying on this item. I heard the word ditto, but I'm going to ask, is there any questions on this item from committee members? Hearing no questions, do we have a motion to move on this item?

Alderman Villegas moves on this item on the 3615 through 3659 South Halsted Street. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? The opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it. And it will be noted that Alderman Thompson is recusing himself from this item.

Okay. Now we're on to document number 8519, 11th Ward. Alderman, you're a busy guy.

This ordinance was referred on January 15th of this year. And the common address is 3465 South, help me Alderman. Lutuanica.

Lutuanica Avenue and 816 through 838 West 35th Street, 825 through 931 West 35th Street and 3501 through 3511 South Sangamon Avenue. And I believe we have a substitute on this item. So I'm going to ask somebody to move the substitute.

Alderman Ravoyos moves to accept the substitute. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Hearing none, the ayes have it and the substitute is before us. Alderman, talk about Sangamon.

[Speaker 4] (1:33:44 - 1:34:13)
This is along 35th Street, just West of Halsted Street. Again, consistent with what we're trying to do on Halsted and our commercials avenues. We are changing from C commercial districts, and in this case there's an RS1, to a B1 district, a neighborhood shopping district, to try to attract more of our retailers in mixed-use retail and residential.

So that's again what we're doing at this location.

[Speaker 1] (1:34:15 - 1:34:58)
So can we have a motion on the substitute ordinance? Alderman Hadden moves to pass on the substitute ordinance. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? Opinion chair, the ayes have it and that substitute is accepted and passed.

Now we are on the top of page three. And I believe, Alderman, the following three items are all going to have substitutes, is that correct? Yes.

And correct me if I'm wrong, what you're doing on the substitutes for our committee is you're taking certain addresses out of this, of these blocks, is that correct?

[Speaker 42] (1:34:59 - 1:34:59)
Correct. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:35:00 - 1:35:22)
All right. So we're now on to document number 8520 in the 11th Ward. Ordinance was referred on January 15th of this year.

Change request, a B32 community shopping district and a C32 commercial manufacturing and employment district to a B11 neighborhood shopping district. Alderman?

[Speaker 4] (1:35:23 - 1:35:40)
Again, trying to be more attractive to the businesses that are coming in and consistent with what we've done in other areas throughout the ward. We are making this a B1 district to make it more consistent with the other areas in the ward.

[Speaker 1] (1:35:40 - 1:36:46)
Okay. Questions? I have a motion, please.

Motion by Alderman Riley to move on the substitute ordinance. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Senior Chair, the ayes have it and the substitute will be reported out on Wednesday. Middle of page, or the second item on page three, document number A8521, 11th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on January 15th. This comment address is 528 through 412, or say it the other way around, 412 through 528 West 31st Street and 451 through 525 West 31st Street. And this change request is a B32 community shopping district, a C12 neighborhood commercial district, an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district, and an RS3 residential single-unit detached house district.

All those will be changed to a B11 neighborhood shopping district. Alderman.

[Speaker 4] (1:36:47 - 1:37:11)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Again, to be consistent with what we've been doing on these other items and what we've been doing throughout the ward over the last number of years is to create a more conducive environment for businesses and residential. And so a B1-1 neighborhood shopping district is what we determined to be the right district and we ask that we get support for that.

[Speaker 1] (1:37:12 - 1:38:30)
Okay. We're going to do two things because we first have to accept the substitute. So I'll get a motion to accept the substitute.

Alderman Cardona moves on the substitute. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? So that substitute is in front of us. Obviously the narrative is the same.

So with that, can I have a motion to move on the substitute ordinance? Alderman Hadden moves to pass on the substitute. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? Continue to hear the ayes have it and it's passed as amended.

The last one in the 11th ward will also have a substitute, I believe, but let me read it into the record. It's document number A8522, 11th ward ordinance referred on January 15th of 2020. This common address is 200 through 336 West 31st Street and 215 through 349 West 31st Street.

So I will ask someone to move on the substitute. Alderman Villegas moves on the substitute ordinance. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? Hearing none, the substitute is before us.

Alderman Thompson.

[Speaker 4] (1:38:30 - 1:38:54)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is our final one that we've gone through systematically and looked at the zoning to bring it in compliance with the B11 neighborhood shopping district, which we believe to be the appropriate district for attracting the businesses and the types of developments that we're looking for in the community. So I would respectfully request the committee support this change as well.

[Speaker 1] (1:38:56 - 1:39:59)
Thank you, Alderman. Any questions for the Alderman? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move this substitute ordinance?

Alderman Haddon moves on the substitute. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Continue to hear the ayes have it and this is passed as amended. Thank you, Alderman.

We'll see you in a couple months. Oh, I thought you said you were finished. Well, that was just worth nine.

I'm only giving you a hundred. All right, let's stick with the 11th Ward and we're going to move to the middle of page 11. And we are on document number 20330, 11th Ward, ordinance referred on February 19th of 2020.

The common address is 1741 South Ruble Street and the change request an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to a C22 motor vehicle related commercial district.

[Speaker 4] (1:40:04 - 1:40:24)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 20] (1:40:25 - 1:40:34)
Morning. Mr. Weinstock had to go to a family emergency at the hospital, so I was wondering if I could step in for him.

[Speaker 1] (1:40:35 - 1:40:37)
Well, step in, step up.

[Speaker 20] (1:40:38 - 1:40:48)
Yeah, so basically this project we're looking at doing an existing gas station and just adding in a convenient car wash in the store, in the car wash.

[Speaker 1] (1:40:50 - 1:40:56)
All right, that's your testimony? Yeah. Okay, so Alderman Thompson.

[Speaker 4] (1:40:56 - 1:41:44)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yes, this is an existing gas station that's at the corner of 18th and Ruble, and we had a community meeting when the neighbors came out and we had no opposition. There's support for this expansion of the existing gas station to allow for a car wash, which I think will be needed in that area of the ward, as well as improving the existing conditions and upgrades to the convenience store inside and the overall corner, and it'll enhance and improve that corner.

So we fully support this project, and like I said, a community meeting was held as well on this.

[Speaker 1] (1:41:45 - 1:43:17)
Thank you, Alderman. And for the record, these are trying times for witnesses and people to come down, so it's the unusual that we're adding the architect speak, but I just want it for the record because we've asked to really minimize the testimony in order to try to get us out of here in a reasonable time. So that would be only today, hopefully.

All right, questions for the applicant, for the Alderman? Hearing none, motion to move on this one first. So moved by Alderman Waguespack.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

Seeing the Chair, the ayes have it, and the item is passed. Okay, thank you. Okay, moving on to the bottom of page 15, document number 20301, 11th Ward, ordinance referred on December 18th of 19, common address 3506 through 3520 South Halstead Street, and the change request is a B33 community shopping district to a C32 commercial manufacturing and employment district, and then to a business plan development.

And okay, we have attorney, please. Andrew?

[Speaker 30] (1:43:17 - 1:44:19)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. Thanks very much for everyone's time today. Andrew Scott with the Law Offices of Dykema Gossett here on behalf of the applicant, Our Revival Chicago LLC.

With me this morning are Tyler Nevis, the principal and sponsor of the proposed project, and to Mr. Nevis' right is Dan O'Reilly of O'Reilly Office, the project architect. This is a very exciting project that we've been working on probably over the last year. It's a redevelopment of the existing Remova Theater, as well as two other properties.

Mr. Nevis' plan is to develop it into a live music venue, a brewery, and a restaurant, really hoping it's going to be a huge catalyst for the neighborhood. I'm sure Alderman Thompson will speak to the popularity in the neighborhood, but we were we're undertaking a plan development principally to the C zoning classification to allow for the brewery component in the project, and then ultimately rezoning it to a business plan development. We're available to answer any questions you might have.

[Speaker 1] (1:44:20 - 1:45:37)
Thank you, Andrew. So since this was at the plan commission, we need to incorporate the records from that plan commission meeting. All those in favor of incorporating the minutes of plan commission?

Alderman Cardona? Who's that? All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? So the records from the plan commission are incorporated into this.

Now do we have questions for attorney and or the alderman? I, as a member of plan commission, this is a I'm sure a very exciting project for, and let me emphasize, South Ulster Street. It is, I don't think we have, we have, we don't have photos of it.

The Ramona, this is Ramona, right? Yeah, okay. So I, for one, want to congratulate the team on this renovation of a, it's a pretty pretty serious block of economic development, and I know the zoning is liberal to accommodate the uses that have been described, but I know, Alderman, you've been waiting on this a long time, so congratulations.

Do we have questions for Alderman Thompson on this one? Did you want to say anything else? Sure.

[Speaker 4] (1:45:37 - 1:46:39)
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Yeah, I do want to reiterate, we did have a community meeting on this. It was unique in that it was unanimous.

I've never been to a community meeting where everybody was in support of this. We had three or four hundred people. It was just approved last week at finance for the redevelopment agreement.

As you mentioned, the plan commission, CDC, there's a lot of excitement, and I think this will be a great project for not only our community, but I think for the city of Chicago, and as you mentioned, on South Halston Street. It's nice to see that development coming down south. This is going to be a great economic engine, catalyst, as well as employment for the entire area, not just in our ward, but throughout the whole south, our neighbors to the south, west, and east of us.

We'll all have opportunities, and I think it'll be a fantastic addition, so I would ask for the support of the committee as well. This is the final sort of step here to get going.

[Speaker 1] (1:46:40 - 1:47:05)
Well, you've been through many hurdles on this, so you've gotten plenty of support in the past. Can I get a motion to pass this ordinance as revised? Alderman Kappelman moves to pass this ordinance as revised.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

Continuing chair, the ayes have it, and again, congratulations, Alderman. This will be passed to the city council as revised for Wednesday.

[Speaker 30] (1:47:15 - 1:47:19)
All right. I'm not sure if this is okay. Wait a second.

[Speaker 1] (1:47:25 - 1:47:27)
Andrew, just identify yourself.

[Speaker 30] (1:47:28 - 1:47:38)
I'm sorry. Again, Andrew Scott with the Law Offices of Dyke and Magossett here on behalf of the applicant, our Revival Chicago LLC. We've discussed this procedural element with your staff, but we have...

[Speaker 1] (1:47:38 - 1:47:38)
We're going to hold it.

[Speaker 30] (1:47:38 - 1:47:52)
We're going to pass out a committee. Hold it in committee, and we will correspond with your office once we've closed on the properties, and if you'd be so good to report it out at that point. Thank you very much.

Thank you. All right. Okay.

[Speaker 42] (1:48:27 - 1:48:27)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:48:31 - 1:49:15)
Moving back to page three, document number A8525 in the Fifth Ward. Ordinance was referred on February 19th of 2020. Common address is 5616 South Maryland Avenue, and the change request is an RM5, residential multi-unit district, and institutional plan development number 43 as amended to institutional plan development number 43.

Patrick, would you enlighten us on this? I'm on Planning Commission, so I'm aware of the subject property. Would you let our committee members be made aware of it, please?

[Speaker 38] (1:49:16 - 1:49:28)
First of all, so Patrick Murphy with the Department of Planning. I'd like to first have the record from the Planning Commission accepted here on the record for all the testimony and details that were given at Planning Commission.

[Speaker 33] (1:49:28 - 1:49:28)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:49:29 - 1:49:38)
So Alderman Wagesback moves to incorporate the records from the Planning Commission. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Making sure the ayes have it, and the records are incorporated.

[Speaker 38] (1:49:39 - 1:50:21)
So then for this parcel in particular, there are a number of standalone parcels that are surrounded entirely by the plan development that establishes or comprises the boundaries of the University of Chicago's campus. This ordinance is designed to take one of those standalone parcels and absorb it within the existing plan development that surrounds it. This particular two-flat is right next door to a multi-story parking garage that serves the campus, and this will allow the university to move ahead for a grant they have received to establish a laboratory for research purposes on that site.

And that's essentially the extent of it.

[Speaker 1] (1:50:22 - 1:51:27)
Questions for the department? And obviously it was Alderman's ordinance, so she's in favor of it? All right.

So can I have a motion to move on this item as revised? Alderman Kaplan moves to pass this as revised. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? Continue to share the ayes have it, and this item will be reported out Wednesday as revised.

Thank you. Next, bottom of page three. Document number 20347, 48th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on February 19th of 2020. The common address of this one is 5440 North Sheridan, and the change request is a residential plan development number 1056 to B35 Community Shopping District. Are we going to hear from the department?

Can you hear me? Oh, yes.

[Speaker 2] (1:51:28 - 1:52:04)
For the record, Rich Clowder, DLA Piper, representing the applicant. Very briefly, a residential business plan development number 1056 approved a project that was never built, which was a 181-foot tall, 174-unit building. The developer of 5440 North Sheridan and property owner LLC now seeks to sunset that PD and revert the zoning to the pre-existing B35 to authorize a much smaller building of five stories and 78 units.

I believe Alderman Osterman on Friday or over the weekend submitted a letter of support to your staff, and I would ask for your favorable approval.

[Speaker 1] (1:52:05 - 1:53:12)
Thank you. We have received the support of Alderman Osterman. Questions for the applicant?

Hearing none, do I have a motion to move on this item? Alderman Kappelman moves on this item as revised? No, I'm sorry.

Just Alderman Kappelman moves do pass on this ordinance. All those in favor? Any opposed?

Seeing the Chair, the ayes have it, and this item is passed. And I'm sure if I lived on Sheridan, I'd be welcome with the change. Okay, top page four, document number 20344 in the 47th ward.

The ordinance was referred on February 19th of 2020. This address is 4845 North Winchester Avenue. The change request is an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district.

Do we have David Smirha? Come on up, introduce yourself.

[Speaker 11] (1:53:13 - 1:53:15)
Hi, David Smirha. I'm the owner of the building.

[Speaker 1] (1:53:16 - 1:53:17)
Speak into the mic if you can.

[Speaker 11] (1:53:17 - 1:53:18)
David Smirha, the owner of the building.

[Speaker 1] (1:53:19 - 1:53:20)
Morning, David.

[Speaker 11] (1:53:20 - 1:53:41)
Morning. I have the support for this project from the Alderman's office, my neighborhood block club, and the Ravenswood Neighborhood Association. If you want, I can read this, but if not, then that's all my comments.

[Speaker 1] (1:53:42 - 1:55:15)
Do we have support from our Alderman? I believe we have verbal support from that, Martin. All right, so yes, Alderman Martin is supporting this zoning change.

We'll put that in the record. Any questions for David? All right, I have a motion to move do pass on the item.

Alderman Wagesbeck moves do pass on this item. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Continue to share the ayes have it, and this will be reported out. Thank you for coming down.

Bottom of page four, in the document number 20340 in the 45th Ward, the ordinance was referred on February 19th of this year. Common address is 5667 West Higgins Avenue, and the change request from an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district.

[Speaker 3] (1:55:24 - 1:56:29)
Counselor? Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Sarah Barnes, and I'm an attorney with the Law Offices of Sam Banks.

I'm here this morning on behalf of the applicant seeking a zoning change from an RS3 to an RT4 in order to effectuate the construction of a new three-story six-unit residential building at the subject property. Although the subject property is currently zoned RS3, the underlying zoning in that area, or I'm sorry, the improvements in the area are mostly multi-unit, so this is compatible with the existing character of the neighborhood. Towards that end, we have met with the local community organizations, as well as Alderman Gardner, and we hosted a public community meeting, which was very well attended and supported, and with that, I do have a letter of support from Alderman Gardner, just acknowledging the same statement, and we respectfully request the support of the zoning committee.

Nicole, if you don't have a copy, okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:56:29 - 1:56:35)
We do have a, I know we have a letter or email of support from...

[Speaker 3] (1:56:35 - 1:56:37)
Okay, thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:56:37 - 1:57:05)
Okay, so we do have a support letter from Alderman Gardner. Questions for the applicant? Hearing no questions, how about a motion to move to pass on this item?

Alderman Maria Hadden moves to pass on this item. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Opinion Chair, the ayes have it. Item is passed.

All right, I'm going to ask my vice chair to take the chair, so to speak, on item in the 44th ward.

[Speaker 41] (1:57:21 - 1:57:51)
Our next item on the agenda is number 20331 in the 44th ward. Ordinance was referred on February 19, 2020. Common address 3123 North Kenmore.

Change request. RS3, residential single unit detached house district to RT3.5, residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district. Attorneys for the record.

[Speaker 21] (1:57:52 - 1:59:05)
Good morning. I am Thomas Pekarsky of the Laughlin Gordon and Pekarsky representing the applicant, Lisa Hall Chang on this matter. We're before you seeking an amendment to the City of Chicago zoning ordinance from the existing RS3 to that of an RT3.5 for the property commonly known as 3123 North Kenmore Avenue. The subject property is a 25 by 125 foot lot and it is currently improved with a two-unit residential building. If the amendment is granted, the applicant will construct a rare addition to the existing building as well as make cosmetic improvements to the interior and exterior. The zoning amendment is sought in order to allow for the additional proposed floor area of the addition.

The building will remain a two-unit building. We have reviewed our plans with Alderman Tunney who is present to provide his insight into the project and have met with the Central Lakeview Neighbors Association at several public meetings and they too have expressed their support for the proposal. Therefore, we ask the committee to vote its recommendation of passage of the application to the full City Council.

[Speaker 41] (1:59:05 - 1:59:11)
Thank you. Any questions members? Alderman Tunney.

[Speaker 1] (1:59:12 - 1:59:48)
Thank you, Vice Chairman. As the attorney represented, this went through a community process and met with the support of the local community. This is a very interesting part of our neighborhood that was down zoned before I was Alderman and most of the buildings are pretty much non-conforming so we have to go through this gymnastics every time we do something like this but the community group wants it that way and I would ask for the support of the Zoning Committee on this item.

Thanks.

[Speaker 41] (1:59:48 - 2:00:04)
Thank you, Alderman. Any other questions? Motion on the floor.

Alderman Kappelman. All in favor? Aye.

All opposed? Any chairs? The ayes have it.

This will be referred to City Council.

[Speaker 1] (2:00:11 - 2:00:43)
For the record, Beal says he's going to oppose me on that one. We won't put that please. Court reporter, I know you're listening.

All right, bottom of page five, document number 20324 in the 40th ward. The ordinance was referred on February 19th of 2020. Common address 4918 North Lincoln Avenue and the change request B12 neighborhood shopping district to B23 neighborhood mixed-use district.

Ready? Mr. Pekarsky.

[Speaker 42] (2:00:43 - 2:00:44)
Good morning again.

[Speaker 21] (2:00:44 - 2:01:48)
Thomas Pekarsky, the law firm of Gordon and Pekarsky here representing the applicant Patrick Landrosch. We're before you seeking an amendment to the City of Chicago's zoning map from the current B12 to that of a B23 for the property commonly known as 4918 North Lincoln Avenue. The subject property is a 75 by 125 foot lot.

It is currently improved with a one-story restaurant building. If the amendment is granted, the applicant will improve the site with a new construction building containing 14 residential units, a ground floor live workspace unit and additional ground floor commercial space. We have reviewed our plans with Alderman Vasquez who has expressed his support of the proposal in the form of a letter that was previously submitted to the chair and have met with the local community at several public meetings and they too have expressed their support.

Therefore, we ask the committee to vote its recommendation of passage of this application to the full City Council. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:01:49 - 2:02:43)
Questions for the attorney? We do have a letter of support from Alderman Vasquez. I have Alderman Scott Wagesback move to pass on this item.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

In the opinion and share of the ayes have it and this will be reported out. Thank you. All right.

Next. Top of page six. Document number 20325 T1 in the 38th ward.

Ordinance was referred on February 19th of 2020 and the common address 6328 West Irving Park Road. Change request a B31 community shopping district to a B23 neighborhood mixed-use district. Good afternoon Mr. Chairman, members of the board. I'm so used to looking right here, so sorry about that. Good afternoon Mr. Chairman, members of the board.

[Speaker 4] (2:02:43 - 2:03:15)
My name is Paul Kulpak with offices at 6767 North Milwaukee. I represent the applicant 6330 Irving Park LLC. Change request is from the current B3-1 to that of B2-3.

If the amendment is passed, the applicant will construct a new three-story nine dwelling unit building. The height of the parking space is in no commercial space. We did have a community meeting with Alderman Sposato there.

[Speaker 1] (2:03:15 - 2:03:41)
We believe we have a letter of support in the file from the Alderman. We do have it. Questions for the attorney?

Again, we do have a letter of support from Alderman Sposato. Hearing no questions, can I get a motion? Alderman Roboyes moves to pass on this item.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

Chair, the ayes have it. This will be reported out on Wednesday.

[Speaker 11] (2:03:41 - 2:03:42)
Thank you for your consideration.

[Speaker 1] (2:03:42 - 2:04:10)
Thank you. Middle of page six, document number 20329, 31st Ward. Ordinance was referred on February 19th of 2020.

Common address is 4341 West Fullerton Avenue and the change request a B1-1 neighborhood shopping district to a C2-1 motor vehicle related commercial district. All right, we have our attorney.

[Speaker 6] (2:04:11 - 2:04:56)
Good morning, Chairman, members of the committee. My name is Hector Morales. I represent the applicant, Luis Venegas, who's requesting a zoning change to the property located at 4341 West Fullerton from a B1-1 neighborhood shopping district to a C2-1 motor vehicle related commercial district.

If the amendment is passed, the applicant intends to use the property for wholesale and retail sales of auto supply and auto parts, including alternators and starters. There won't be no installation on the property itself. One overnight parking space in the rear of the store will be dedicated for overnight parking for the owner.

I'm respectfully requesting that the committee pass the amendment.

[Speaker 11] (2:04:57 - 2:05:49)
All right, let's hear from Alderman Cardona. Thank you, Chair. When the owner of the auto parts place came to speak to me, I was considering it because it's been vacant for many years and it's something that I told them I had to talk to the neighbors surrounding the area, get their feedback, and what I got was very positive.

They wanted something there and I explained to them it could be an alternator, whether you're doing things you like, that they were okay with it. Also, it will provide jobs, certain jobs for the members of the community, and I was greatly supportive with that. So, if I could have your support on this ordinance, I greatly appreciate it.

[Speaker 1] (2:05:50 - 2:06:36)
Thank you, Alderman. Questions for the applicant or Alderman? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move to pass?

Alderman Beall moves to pass on this item. All those in favor? Aye.

Aye. Any opposed? Continuing Chair, the ayes have it and the item will be reported out at Wednesday's meeting.

Thank you very much. Bottom of page six, document number 20338, 31st Ward. Ordinance was referred on February 19th of 2020.

This comment address is 2734 through 58 North Cicero Avenue, and the change request, B11 Neighborhood Shopping District to a C11 Neighborhood Commercial District. Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee.

[Speaker 12] (2:06:36 - 2:07:51)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Daniel Box. I'm an attorney with the law offices of Sam Banks, located at 221 North LaSalle.

I'm here today on behalf of the applicant, Cicero Food Mart, Inc. Although the applicant is not the property owner of the property, the president of the applicant is also the managing member of the property owner itself. The subject site consists of two separate and independent zoning lots, one of which is improved with a four-pump gas station facility and a one-story retail commercial accessory building.

The second lot is improved with a one-story retail commercial building and surface parking lot. The applicant is proposing to raise the existing structures and to locate and establish a new gas station facility, accessory convenience store, and accessory single lane automated car wash at the subject site. In order to permit the project, the applicant is seeking to amend the underlying zoning from a B12 Neighborhood Shopping District to a C12 Neighborhood Commercial District.

The applicant has reviewed the project with Alderman Cardona. A letter of support should already be on file with your office, and with that we'd be happy to answer any questions that you might have on the project.

[Speaker 1] (2:07:52 - 2:07:56)
Alderman, we do have a letter of support on file. Would you like to say a few words?

[Speaker 11] (2:07:57 - 2:08:22)
Yes, I would like to say a few words. This is a great opportunity for that corner on Cicero and diversity. I spoke to the residents and businesses and they were supportive of this new business coming in or basically updating the gas station but also bringing that new business next door which is combining both lots.

I'm trying to bring new development along that corridor and this is the first step and if I could have your support, I greatly appreciate it.

[Speaker 1] (2:08:23 - 2:08:29)
Questions for the applicant? Oh, hold on. We have a department.

Steve, you want to talk about this?

[Speaker 20] (2:08:30 - 2:08:44)
The Valenziano Department of Planning and Development. The attorney said that they're going to a C12, but we have it in the ordinance as a C11.

[Speaker 1] (2:08:46 - 2:08:54)
All right, so let's rectify that situation. I didn't catch it myself. Thank you.

So what is it? The applicant? Counselor?

[Speaker 12] (2:08:55 - 2:08:57)
It's a C11. Yeah, that's right.

[Speaker 1] (2:08:57 - 2:08:57)
C11.

[Speaker 12] (2:08:58 - 2:08:59)
That's right. C11.

[Speaker 1] (2:08:59 - 2:09:54)
Right. His narrative was C12, I guess. Okay, so we're right on.

It's C11, just as it's presented in our paperwork. All right. Thank you, Steve, for catching that.

Any more questions for the alderman or the applicants? Hearing none, alderman walks back. Moves do pass on the item.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

The ayes have it and this will be reported out. All right, we are staying in the 31st ward at the top of page 7. This application number is 20343, 31st ward.

Ordinance was referred on February 19th of this year, 2020. Address 3047 North Cicero Avenue and the change request. B11 Neighborhood Shopping District to a C11 Neighborhood Commercial District.

[Speaker 26] (2:09:56 - 2:11:03)
Mark? Yes, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, my name is Mark Kupiec. I'm an attorney with offices at 77 West Washington.

I represent the applicant and this particular application, we're looking to rezone to property 3047 North Cicero Avenue from a B11 to a C1-1. Doing a little research, it appears that I believe that at one time in the past this actually was zoned C1 being on Cicero Avenue and it was down zoned perhaps by a prior alderman. But the reason for this zoning is to allow the applicant to establish a catering business within the existing building.

Actually, a restaurant operates in the building at this time and the idea would be to operate a catering business actually at least initially to sell to cater to daycare centers. The daughter of the applicants actually owns a couple of daycare centers and initially they're going to sell to her and other daycare centers. We did meet with the alderman, with the applicants, explain the proposal and I believe the alderman's here so I would defer to the alderman.

[Speaker 1] (2:11:04 - 2:11:06)
All right, Alderman Cardona.

[Speaker 11] (2:11:07 - 2:11:35)
Thank you, Chairman. I support small businesses which is this is why I'm supporting this kind of business supply for home daycares or also daycare establishments in our community. This is something that's very vital and I like to see small businesses go forward and also be a product of our community.

So if I could have your help and support on this ordinance, I greatly appreciate it. Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (2:11:35 - 2:11:42)
Just a quick question. The attorney said that it's an existing restaurant as we speak.

[Speaker 11] (2:11:44 - 2:11:49)
So it's an exit, well, it used to be a restaurant. It closed and it's been empty.

[Speaker 1] (2:11:49 - 2:12:04)
Oh, it's been empty. Yes. All right.

Okay, great. Other questions or comments for the alderman or the applicants? Hearing none, do I have a motion to move to pass on this item?

Alderman Hadden moves to pass on this item. All those in favor?

[Speaker 40] (2:12:05 - 2:12:05)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (2:12:05 - 2:12:11)
Any opposed? Opinion chair, the ayes have it and this item will be passed. Congratulations, alderman.

[Speaker 9] (2:12:11 - 2:12:12)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:12:12 - 2:12:13)
All right.

[Speaker 9] (2:12:15 - 2:12:34)
Yes, Alderman Beal. I do have to get to another appointment. I just wanted to state on the record that I just got confirmation from the police, I'm sorry, the fire commissioner, and he knew nothing about this meeting or the ordinance being brought before us that we voted on earlier today.

And so I just wanted to say that on the record.

[Speaker 1] (2:12:34 - 2:13:21)
Thank you, alderman. I think it's a lack of communication or something in the IGA, but so be it. We'll be talking on Wednesday.

I'm sure he should be there. All right. I will reach out to him actually.

So thank you. All right. Top of page eight, document number 20334, 27th Ward.

The ordinance was referred on February 19th of 2020. Common address is 1367 West Chicago Avenue and the change request B12 Neighborhood Shopping District to B13 Neighborhood Shopping District. Good morning or afternoon.

[Speaker 35] (2:13:22 - 2:14:31)
State your name for the record, please. My name is Ali Manesh. I'm the owner of the property and this is an old building that I have been living there for the last 14 years.

Could you speak a little bit louder into the mic, please? My name is Ali Manesh. I'm the owner of the building.

This is an old building which I have been living there for the last 14 years and needs a major improvement. And one idea was to completely demolish that and then build a new construction there. But because of substandard lot, the new building couldn't be enough to economically justify the process.

So we went for application for rezoning. Eckerd Park Community Council met on that and approved that and sent it to Alderman Walter Barnett. And we had in January a neighborhood meeting with Alderman Barnett and there was no opposition.

And therefore, with the blessing of Alderman, I applied the rezoning. And I don't know whether he has sent a letter because I was told by his office that he's going to be here. Right.

[Speaker 1] (2:14:32 - 2:15:10)
Well, the Alderman is not here today, but he did voice his support for this application for the new four-unit building. Yep. And I want other questions for the owner of the building or the Alderman.

I don't have any questions, so can I get a motion to move do pass on this item? Alderman David Moore moves do pass on this item. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? Committee Chair, the ayes have it.

And this item will be reported out in the affirmative on Wednesday.

[Speaker 35] (2:15:10 - 2:15:11)
Appreciate it.

[Speaker 1] (2:15:11 - 2:15:14)
Okay. We hope you're there for another 14 years.

[Speaker 42] (2:15:14 - 2:15:14)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:15:16 - 2:15:41)
All right. Next, middle of page 8, document number 20335T1 in the 27th Ward. The ordinance was referred on February 19th of 2020.

And the common address is 1458 through 1500 North Wieland Street. Change request. RM5 residential multi-unit district to a B23 neighborhood mixed-use district.

[Speaker 15] (2:15:44 - 2:17:28)
Thomas Raines here for the applicants, Nader and Juan Hindo. They are also the owners of the property. The property is currently improved with two buildings consisting of a total of seven units.

The buildings are obviously side-by-side. The plan is to go from the RM5 to the B23 to allow for new construction of a seven-unit building. So they're replacing the seven units with seven units.

There currently is no parking on either lot at this point. They're seeking to build a 12,500 square foot building, 58 feet high, with three on-site parking spaces in a garage, one of which will be handicap accessible. We've met with, we'll also have to go to the ZBA for a reduction of the rear yard from 30 to 10 and to establish a transit serve location.

We're within the 1,320 feet of the Brown Line. We've met with the Old Town Residents and Merchants Association. We started back in July of 17.

We had a complete community meeting in April of 18. There were a couple of different changes to the facade of the building, and we had been back to the zoning committee meeting of Old Town Residents and Merchants several times since. We've entered into a restrictive covenant by which after the zoning is granted and a CFO is issued, there's a certain period of time for which the property will be, the applicant will have to file and rezone the property back to the RM-5.

We also have the support of the Alderman's Office, which I believe has been conveyed.

[Speaker 1] (2:17:29 - 2:17:51)
Great. We do have a letter of, or a verbal commitment from Alderman Burnett. Questions for Mr. Rains?

I just have a comment. You're trying to tell me that this thing is three years in the making? It has been.

Even though you filed in this year, you did not file until you had the support?

[Speaker 15] (2:17:51 - 2:17:58)
We met with the community group. We promised the Alderman we wouldn't file until we had their support. Ended up having to do a restrictive covenant, but we have it now.

[Speaker 1] (2:17:59 - 2:18:26)
So it's been a long process. So I appreciate your patience and the Alderman's support. Do I get a motion to move to pass on the item?

Alderman Roboyes moves to pass on this item. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Opinion Chair, the ayes have it. Item is passed.

Thank you, Tom. Thank you. All right.

Alderman Villegas, you want to take to the floor? Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 16] (2:18:26 - 2:18:44)
I just wanted to clear the record and also add to the record that Chicago Fire Department was aware of the measure. Hence, all of the calls out to the Alderman regarding their position on this and the Mayor's Office did have a discussion with the Commissioner about this measure. So CFD was well aware of it.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:18:44 - 2:19:20)
Thank you. As I say, I think we'll have some discussion about it on Wednesday. All right.

All right. So bottom of page eight. Again, now we're in the 26th board on document number 20337.

The ordinance was referred on February 19th of 2020. And again, in the 26th board, this address 1628 North Harding Avenue. And the change request is an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RM 4.5 residential multi-unit district.

[Speaker 12] (2:19:22 - 2:19:23)
Good morning.

[Speaker 1] (2:19:23 - 2:19:26)
Once again, we're afternoon now. Okay.

[Speaker 12] (2:19:26 - 2:20:14)
Good afternoon. Once again, Daniel Box, Attorney with the Law Offices of Sam Banks, located at 221 North LaSalle. I'm here today on behalf of the applicant, Noel Roman, who's also the owner of the subject property located at 1628 North Harding.

The applicant is seeking to bring into compliance the existing second dwelling unit located within the existing three-story, two-unit nonconforming residential building. No changes are proposed to the height, setbacks, or footprint of the building. In order to permit the project, the applicant is seeking a zoning change from an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RM 4.5 residential multi-unit district. We've worked with the local community and Alderman Maldonado on this project. A letter of support, I believe, is already on file. With that, I'd be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (2:20:14 - 2:21:33)
We have a letter of support from Alderman Maldonado. Questions for the attorney? Hearing none, I get a motion.

Move to pass on the item. Alderman Kappelman moves to pass on this item. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? Then you share the ayes have it.

This item will be reported out. Thank you very much. All right, we are in, I'm sorry, top of page nine.

Document number 20333-T1 in the 25th Ward Ordinance was referred on February 19th of 2020. And the common address is 425-449 West 17th Street, 1700-1734 South Stewart Avenue, 1717-1735 South Stewart Avenue, and 400-448 West 18th Street, and 1701-1735 South Canal Street. The change request is a commercial manufacturing plan development number 1301 to planned manufacturing district number 11, sub area B.

All right, a lot of narrative.

[Speaker 25] (2:21:34 - 2:22:53)
Thank you. Good afternoon, Chairman Taney and members of the Zoning Committee. My name is Richard Tolf.

I'm an attorney at Daly & Georges with offices at 20 South Clark Street in Chicago. I'm appearing on behalf of the applicant's new Chinatown Real Estate LLC, which does seek a zoning change to remove an existing plan development for a project that will not be built and to revert to the underlying planned manufacturing district. Of course, the developer, architect, and contractor had planned to be here, but due to conditions, I'm a poor substitute for all of them.

The applicant is the owner, developer, and will be the operator of the site, which is generally the southwest corner of 17th and Canal. A one three-story building with a courtyard is proposed. The site will focus on grocery and restaurant uses with some retail and office space.

Although it was not required, the applicant agreed to process the application as a Type 1 rezoning. We did submit a substitute narrative and site plan, Type 1 narrative and site plan. There's no significant changes in the substitute narrative and site plan.

There's small adjustments to dimensions and an inch change in the height. Some other minor changes. We ask that that substitute narrative and site plan be incorporated.

[Speaker 1] (2:22:53 - 2:23:11)
So let me ask for a motion to accept the substitute narrative plans for the Type 1 application. Alderman Waguespack moves on that substitute narrative. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? So the ayes have it and the narrative and plans are accepted.

[Speaker 25] (2:23:13 - 2:23:30)
So the applicant did, of course, present the project to the Alderman and to the Alderman's Zoning Advisory Group. That group was supportive of the project and allowed us to proceed to this point. Based on that support, the Alderman was kind enough to provide his own letter of support, which I believe is in your file.

[Speaker 1] (2:23:30 - 2:23:33)
We have a letter from Alderman Sitio Lopez. Yes, we do.

[Speaker 25] (2:23:34 - 2:23:39)
So pending any questions on behalf of the applicant, we do request your favorable recommendation and we thank you for your time this morning.

[Speaker 1] (2:23:41 - 2:23:50)
All right, questions, comments? We have the Alderman's support. This is a very large piece of property, is it not?

[Speaker 25] (2:23:52 - 2:23:54)
It was a plan development that's being removed.

[Speaker 1] (2:23:56 - 2:24:08)
So I get what it is, but so it is 156,000 square feet plus? And it's all going to be commercial? Correct.

[Speaker 25] (2:24:09 - 2:24:11)
Well, correct. So the zoning will be PMB.

[Speaker 1] (2:24:12 - 2:24:21)
Oh, that's right. And you mentioned that we're doing, the deal hasn't been done, basically.

[Speaker 25] (2:24:21 - 2:24:40)
Yeah, so right. So there was a previous plan development approval. That is no longer being constructed, which is not too far a throw from that.

But it's a little different design. So we can do it without the PV. We can't do it with the PV.

So we're actually just restoring the underlying plan manufacturing.

[Speaker 1] (2:24:40 - 2:25:46)
Okay. So it's incumbent on this change to get this going? Yes.

Okay, other questions, comments? Hearing none, do I have a motion to pass this ordinance with substantive narrative and plans? All the Manhattan moves do pass with substantive narrative and plans.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

Continue to share the ayes have it with the substantive narrative and plans. Good luck. All right.

We are in the 23rd Ward, middle of page nine. Document number 20342T1, 23rd Ward. Ordinance was referred on February 19th of 2020.

Common address is 5781 through 5789 South Archer Avenue. And the change request, M11 Limited Manufacturing Business Park District and RT4 Residential Two-Flat Townhouse and Multi-Unit District to a B31 Community Shopping District.

[Speaker 3] (2:25:50 - 2:25:51)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 40] (2:25:51 - 2:25:51)
Good afternoon, Sarah.

[Speaker 3] (2:25:52 - 2:26:54)
And members of the committee, once again, my name is Sarah Barnes, and I'm an attorney with the Law Offices of Sam Banks. Here this afternoon on behalf of the applicant, what we have here, Mr. Chairman, is a split zoned parcel, unfortunately. And in order, therefore, to reactivate the site, we do need to cure the existing split zoning.

And that will allow for the construction of a new medical office building, which was actually very well received by the community and the aldermen. So we are here today in order to convert that split zoning to a single unified zoning. As I mentioned, we did meet with Alderman Tabarez, as well as various members of the community to go over the proposal.

All of them are in support at this time. And we also have a letter from Alderman Tabarez acknowledging that sentiment. And with that, we just very respectfully request the approval of the Zoning Committee for this proposal.

[Speaker 1] (2:26:54 - 2:27:42)
Thank you, Sarah. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Tabarez. Questions for attorney?

Hearing none, Alderman Kappelman moves to pass on this item. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? You can share the ayes have it, and the item will be reported out. Thank you.

Thank you. Now we're on to page 10. And this document number is 20328, 21st Ward.

The ordinance was referred on February 19th of 2020. Common address, 9400 South Bishop Street. And the change request, RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RT3.5 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district.

[Speaker 33] (2:27:45 - 2:28:46)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon. Kenny Olatunji.

I'm the attorney for the applicant for this zoning request change. The zoning request change is to allow the existing RS3 to be converted to RT3.5. This is to allow the conversion of the existing two dwelling units to RT3 dwelling units within the existing building. There is a RT3 garage, RT3 parking space in the building.

So each of the units will be entitled to a garage. This is a large corner lot, 6442 square feet. And the Alderman is in support of this amendment.

So we are asking for your kind consideration for the change.

[Speaker 19] (2:28:47 - 2:28:47)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (2:28:49 - 2:29:07)
Questions for the applicant. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Howard Brookins. No questions.

A motion moved by Alderman Roboyas. Do pass on this item. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? The opinion chair, the ayes have it.

Item will be reported out in the past.

[Speaker 33] (2:29:07 - 2:29:08)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:29:08 - 2:29:40)
Thank you. Middle of, well, we're going to, oh, okay. All right.

Middle of page 10, document number 20332T1. In the 20th board, the ordinance was referred on February 19th of 2020. Common address 1347 through 49 West 47th street.

And the change request M12 limited manufacturing business park district to a C12 neighborhood commercial district.

[Speaker 27] (2:29:41 - 2:30:28)
Councilor. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name for the record is Thomas S.

Moore. And this is a request to take a lot, a double lot that is basically a dumping ground for garbage and make it into Mr. Orsetta's business on the ground floor and two apartments above. We had a community meeting at which no one showed up, even though we mailed on it.

So the alderman asked us to, and we had a second community meeting where we wired the neighborhood in both Spanish and English, and we had some people show up and we went door to door in the neighborhood. And we do have a letter of support from the alderman and we'd ask for your support as well. Thank you, councilor.

[Speaker 1] (2:30:28 - 2:30:40)
Questions for, I am aware because I did talk to the alderman personally and she is in support of this item. Um, did you, did she give you a letter? Was it just verbal?

[Speaker 27] (2:30:40 - 2:30:45)
Yes, which I gave Nicole. I have another copy if you need it.

[Speaker 1] (2:30:46 - 2:31:31)
Okay. All right. Questions?

Hearing none. Do I have a motion? Motion.

Maria Hadden moves to pass on this item. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Can you chair? The ayes have it.

The item will be passed. Thank you. Now we're on top of page 11.

Document number 20341, 14th Ward. Ordinance was referred on February 19th of 2020. And the common address here is 5648 South Archer Avenue.

Change request is a C12 neighborhood commercial district to a C21 motor vehicle related commercial district. Sarah.

[Speaker 3] (2:31:32 - 2:33:10)
Hi again. Um, thank you again, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. Once more for the record.

My name is Sarah Barnes. I'm going to turn you to the last of the campaign here this afternoon on behalf of the applicant, um, Midway Dispensary. Um, towards the end, the property is presently improved with a one-story multi-unit commercial building.

Midway Dispensary has been operating a medical cannabis dispensary out of one of those, um, storefronts for the last several years and recently converted to allow for the adult use cannabis sale, um, around January 1st, 2020. As a result of the same and success in this area, um, they've outgrown their space. There's a vacant storefront immediately next door into which they would like to expand their existing dispensary operations.

So we are here simply for a, to allow for that use for expansion of use. There's no physical changes proposed to the building itself. And then of course, if this committee were to grant or were to approve the zoning change here today, the applicant would still need to proceed to the Zoning Board of Appeals and seek a special use for the expansion of the dispensary operations.

With that in mind, we've met with Alderman Burke as well as various of the community members and organizations. And we do have the support of all those entrusted parties at this time. Towards that end, Alderman Burke has issued a letter of support.

I have a copy with me.

[Speaker 1] (2:33:10 - 2:33:14)
We have a copy from Alderman Burke, a letter of support, I should say.

[Speaker 3] (2:33:14 - 2:33:16)
Thank you so much. I'm happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (2:33:16 - 2:33:23)
Questions for the attorney? Hearing none. Oh, I'm sorry.

Alderman David Moore.

[Speaker 6] (2:33:24 - 2:33:31)
Thank you, Chairman. So just to be clear, it's currently an existing licensed dispensary.

[Speaker 1] (2:33:32 - 2:33:33)
Medical?

[Speaker 3] (2:33:34 - 2:33:55)
Yeah, it was one of the first medical cannabis dispensaries. And then on January 1st, it did exercise the right to convert and add the adult use cannabis. So the expansion will be to allow for both the medical, sale for medical and adult use.

[Speaker 6] (2:33:56 - 2:34:02)
So when you say expansion, it's just expansion of sale. Cannabis, are they expanding the footprint?

[Speaker 3] (2:34:03 - 2:34:19)
They are expanding the footprint. Right now, they're operating out of a single storefront. There's a vacant storefront that's essentially attached to the building.

And they would just be expanding to add some additional space.

[Speaker 6] (2:34:19 - 2:34:20)
All right. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:34:20 - 2:34:23)
And then a trip to the ZBA?

[Speaker 3] (2:34:24 - 2:34:28)
Proceeding to the Zoning Board of Appeals in order to allow for that.

[Speaker 1] (2:34:28 - 2:35:09)
Any other questions, comments? If not, can I get a motion? Motion by Alderman Haddon.

Move to pass on this item. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Opinion Chair, the ayes have it. And this item is passed.

Bottom of page 11, document number 20326. In the Sixth Ward, ordinance was referred on February 19th of 2020. Common address is 7401 South State Street.

Change request, M12 Limited Manufacturing Business Park District to M22 Light Industry District.

[Speaker 42] (2:35:11 - 2:35:13)
Good afternoon. Good afternoon.

[Speaker 31] (2:35:14 - 2:36:10)
Karen Shaw on behalf of the applicant and Schiller Prairie Law Firm. Today, we are seeking a zoning amendment change from an M1-1 to an M2-2 to allow for a special use permit required for a craft grower's license. Currently, the property is not in use.

The applicant intends to renovate the property to be in compliance with all city, state, and federal regulations for craft growing facilities. The facility will create approximately 30 to 50 jobs. It will produce about 6,000 pounds of cannabis to be distributed to other dispensaries.

It's a fully self-contained facility and will not be dispensing any cannabis from that warehouse manufacturing unit. And I invite any questions that the council may have.

[Speaker 1] (2:36:10 - 2:36:18)
Right. So today, we're just doing the zoning change. You said special use, but that's the second step of the process.

[Speaker 14] (2:36:19 - 2:36:19)
Is that correct?

[Speaker 31] (2:36:19 - 2:36:19)
Correct.

[Speaker 1] (2:36:20 - 2:36:24)
Okay. Just want to make sure. You've spoken to the alderman?

[Speaker 31] (2:36:25 - 2:36:41)
Yes, we have spoken to the alderman. The alderman has issued a letter of support. And we did perform two community meetings.

One on February 3rd, 2020 and one on February 27th, 2020. I've also fielded several calls from community members.

[Speaker 1] (2:36:43 - 2:36:47)
Community members. Okay, great questions for the applicant. Alderman David Moore.

[Speaker 6] (2:36:48 - 2:36:59)
Yeah, I have no doubt that the alderman has done his, hopefully, I'm sure he's done his due diligence. But I just want to know for myself, Guaranteed Investment Corporation, is that a minority-owned company?

[Speaker 31] (2:37:02 - 2:37:12)
I'm not too sure of what the official definition of minority-owned is. However, I can say that the owners are not Caucasian.

[Speaker 6] (2:37:17 - 2:37:19)
Do you know the ethnicity of the company?

[Speaker 31] (2:37:22 - 2:37:29)
I would be strained to say what their ethnicity is. I think Middle Eastern.

[Speaker 6] (2:37:29 - 2:37:31)
All right. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:37:31 - 2:37:32)
Other questions?

[Speaker 6] (2:37:33 - 2:37:34)
No.

[Speaker 1] (2:37:35 - 2:38:28)
Hearing no other questions for the committee members, do I have a motion moved to pass on the item? Alderman Roboyas moves to pass on the item. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? Hearing none, the item is passed and we'll report it out Wednesday.

Top of page 12. Document number 20346-T1 in the third ward. The ordinance was referred on February 19th of 2020.

20, common address is 2513-2517 South Wabash Avenue. And the change request, M13, Limited Manufacturing Business Park District to a C13 Neighborhood Commercial District. And all right.

What is C13?

[Speaker 12] (2:38:31 - 2:39:15)
Okay. Counselor. Good afternoon.

My name is Zubin Kamula. I'm an attorney with Siegel and Moses. I'm appearing on behalf of the applicant, JBR Brewing, LLC.

The amendment the applicant seeks is to change the zoning from an M13 Limited Manufacturing Business Park District to a C13 Neighborhood Commercial District. The applicant is seeking the amendment in order to operate a brew pub, a general restaurant with an event space in excess of the 4,000 square foot limitation that is currently in place. The applicant has met with Alderman Dowell and she is in support of the project.

[Speaker 1] (2:39:16 - 2:40:11)
Our records show that Alderman Dowell is in support of it and has written a letter. We have questions for the applicant. Hearing none, can I get a motion to move to pass on this item?

Alderman David Moore moves to pass on this item. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Opinion Chair, the ayes have it and it will be passed out to the subcommittee on Wednesday. All right.

Bottom of page 12. Document number 20336. In the first ward, ordinance was referred on February 19th of 2020.

This address is 1302 North Milwaukee Avenue and the change request, B13 Neighborhood Shopping District to a C13 Neighborhood Commercial District. Interesting application here. Do you want to proceed?

[Speaker 34] (2:40:13 - 2:41:12)
Identify yourself for the record. Good morning, Chairman, or good afternoon, Chairman, members of the committee. For the record, my name is Austin DeLong.

I'm co-owner of the Ray River Group LLC, The Applicant. We are here asking for a change from a B13 Neighborhood Shopping District to a C13 Neighborhood Commercial District for the property in question of 1302 North Milwaukee for a new indoor mini golf and bar in the ground floor commercial space. And I just want to note there will be no change to the existing dwelling units in the building.

We have a letter of support from Alderman LaSpada, the first ward. I have that letter with me if it's not on file. We have a letter from Alderman LaSpada.

Thank you. As part of the application, we also have a letter of support from the owner. And further, we've had meetings with the Wicker Park Bucktown Chamber of Commerce and a community meeting held by the Wicker Park Committee and received their support as well.

Therefore, we respectfully ask for your favorable approval of this change.

[Speaker 1] (2:41:14 - 2:41:57)
So we have a technical change on this moving this application to a Type 1, which is specific to the... Correct. Exact.

So I need a motion to accept the application as a Type 1. Alderman Wagesvac moves to move this application to a Type 1 application. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? Continuing to share the ayes have it.

And it is amended as a Type 1 application. That being said, on the Type 1 application, can I get a motion to move do pass as amended? Alderman David Moore moves do pass.

I'm sorry. I was too eager. David?

[Speaker 6] (2:41:57 - 2:42:05)
Yeah. So is this type of project, which sounds very interesting, is this your first time doing this or have you guys done this elsewhere?

[Speaker 34] (2:42:05 - 2:42:11)
It's our first business, yes. I'm sorry? It's our first business.

Okay. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:42:12 - 2:42:14)
That would be cute if I asked, what about a hole in one?

[Speaker 34] (2:42:14 - 2:42:17)
What do you get? Maybe a free beer.

[Speaker 1] (2:42:19 - 2:42:32)
That's been a long meeting. Well, and it brings up a point. So has this been done in other cities, this type of concept?

Or is this novel to Chicago?

[Speaker 34] (2:42:32 - 2:42:46)
Yeah. We've seen this specific example of a mini golf course and associated bar work very well in other cities, to name a few, Seattle, San Francisco, and London. And we've also seen numerous activity-based establishments here in Chicago do very well.

[Speaker 1] (2:42:46 - 2:42:48)
And the size of this space?

[Speaker 34] (2:42:49 - 2:42:52)
The square footage is 4,679 square feet.

[Speaker 1] (2:42:55 - 2:43:52)
Comments, other comments or questions? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move do pass on the item? Alderman Raboyas moves do pass on this item as amended to a type one.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

Opinion chair, the ayes have it. And item is passed as amended. All right.

What are we on now? 13? Yeah, deferred agenda.

OK. Deferred agenda. Page 13.

And we're on document number 20297, 42nd Ward. Ordinance was referred on December 18th of 19. Common address, 777 North Franklin Avenue.

The change request, DX5, Downtown Mixed-Use District to plan. I'm sorry, to business plan development. And Rich is here.

Rich, you want to talk?

[Speaker 2] (2:43:52 - 2:44:20)
I am. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. Rich Clowder, DLA Piper for the applicant, RPO 225 West Chicago LLC.

This is property located at 777 North Franklin, the southeast corner of Franklin and Chicago. As a preliminary matter, Mr. Chairman, this was before the plan commission on February 20th, excuse me, 21st, 2020. Where it received a recommendation for approval.

May we have the transcript from that hearing be incorporated into the record of today's proceeding, please?

[Speaker 1] (2:44:20 - 2:44:37)
So I'm going to ask to incorporate the records from the plan commission. All those in favor? Aye.

And well, Alderman Moravoyas moves it. And all those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Hearing none, the records are incorporated.

[Speaker 2] (2:44:38 - 2:45:03)
OK, thank you. Very briefly, the property is currently zoned DX5. No change in the underlying zoning is proposed.

Rather, the applicant requests a rezoning to business plan development to permit the construction of a nine-story commercial office building with seven parking spaces. The property is 15,000 plus square feet. It's located at Chicago and Franklin, literally steps from the Chicago Avenue Brown Line stop.

We ask for this committee's favorable recommendation. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:45:05 - 2:45:12)
OK, so repeat for the record, this is all office, correct, Rick?

[Speaker 2] (2:45:12 - 2:45:13)
It's all office, yes.

[Speaker 1] (2:45:14 - 2:45:34)
And I know it's adjacent, obviously, to the station. What is the number of parking spaces? Seven parking spaces.

And you've met with Alderman Riley, and obviously, we have a support letter. OK, great. OK, anything else you want to talk about?

That's it.

[Speaker 2] (2:45:34 - 2:45:35)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:45:35 - 2:45:38)
It's a handsome-looking building. I'm not sure it's a bird-friendly building.

[Speaker 2] (2:45:39 - 2:45:47)
It is a bird-friendly building. That was reviewed by the planning department en route to the plan commission last month.

[Speaker 1] (2:45:47 - 2:46:30)
Great. Questions, comments? If not, can I get a motion to pass this item as revised?

Alderman Kappelman moves to pass as revised. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Committee Chair, the ayes have it, and this item is passed as revised. Thank you.

Thanks, Rich. All right, middle of page 13, document number 20236, 35th Ward. Ordinance was referred on November 13th of 2019.

Common address is 3566 West Belden Avenue. And the change request, RS3, residential single-unit detached house district to an RT4, residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district.

[Speaker 26] (2:46:30 - 2:47:26)
All right, Mark. Good afternoon, members of the committee. My name is Mark Kupiec.

I'm an attorney with offices at 77 West Washington. Represent the applicants, Arthur Kazmarek and Anna Bugheim. Applicants are also the owner of the subject property.

Subject property is currently improved with an old frame residential building, which has an old attic apartment. Unfortunately, there's no permit record for that attic apartment. The applicants plan to rehab the existing building and are looking for a zoning change so they could re-establish that attic apartment and use the building as a three-flat.

They have met and talked extensively with Alderman Rosa and his staff. And at his request, have talked to a number of residents and also met with some of the people from the local community organization to explain the project. And I do believe the alderman has written, submitted a letter to the committee.

[Speaker 1] (2:47:26 - 2:48:20)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Ramirez Rosa. Questions? I need a motion to move on this item.

Alderman Kappelman moves to pass on this item. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Can you chair? The ayes have it.

And this item will be reported out. Thank you, Mark. Thank you.

All right. Bottom of page 13, document number 20248. In the 32nd ward, the ordinance was referred on November 13th of 2019.

Common address is 1514 through 1518 West Diversity Parkway. The change request, RT3.5, residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to an RT4, residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district.

[Speaker 27] (2:48:20 - 2:49:18)
Did I see Mr. Moore? I am here. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm going to take my glasses off. Members of the committee, my name for the record is Thomas S. Moore.

When this was originally filed, it was filed as the same zoning change from a 3.5 to an RT4, but it was originally conceived as a six-unit building. After a community process and at the alderman's request and in his letter of support, he asks us, we have filed with the zoning department a substitute narrative and plans for two three-unit buildings, and the alderman wants us to make it a T1. So as a preliminary matter, I'd ask if we can adopt the amended plans and narrative and consider this a T1 amendment.

[Speaker 1] (2:49:18 - 2:49:32)
So Alderman Maria Hadden moves to amend this application to a type one application. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Hearing none, the ayes have it and the item is amended as a type one application.

[Speaker 27] (2:49:32 - 2:49:38)
And that type one is two three-unit buildings instead of? One six. Instead of a six-unit building.

[Speaker 1] (2:49:40 - 2:50:35)
All right, anything else? No, that's the request. Questions on this application?

Hearing none, do I have a motion? Motion moved to pass by Alderman Kappelman on this type one application. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? Opinion chair, the ayes have it and it's passed as a type one application.

Thank you, Mr. Moore. All right, top page 14. In the, again in the 32nd ward, item number 20312.

This ordinance was referred on January 15th of 2020. The address is 2551 North Milwaukee Avenue and 3061 West Logan Boulevard. The change request to B33 Community Shopping District to a C23 Motor Vehicle Related Commercial District.

All right.

[Speaker 39] (2:50:36 - 2:51:27)
Good afternoon, Katrina McGuire, Thompson Coburn here on behalf of the applicant. The purpose of this rezoning is to ultimately, subsequent to rezoning approval to pursue a special use for a cannabis dispensary at the proposed location. We met with both the Logan Square Chamber, Logan Square Preservation, as well as had a broader community meeting to discuss this proposal.

In conjunction with Logan Square Preservation, we're also proposing to do some rehab work. This is an orange rated building within the landmark district. To rehabilitate the external exterior of the building.

We are also in agreement with Logan Square Preservation and at the alderman's request to either down zone the property back to the B3 zoning upon licensure, or to have a covenant recorded that would limit the uses permitted at the site to those permitted under the B3.

[Speaker 1] (2:51:28 - 2:51:37)
All right. It is in the 32nd ward. Alderman Wagesbach is here.

Would you like to comment, Alderman?

[Speaker 24] (2:51:37 - 2:53:02)
Yes, Chairman. Just quickly, we looked at trying to do a type one. That wasn't possible.

So we're looking at a possible covenant there. But the community and the surrounding area, for the most part, were very comfortable and supported this proposed change. And the fact that we're able to restore this old bank building, a landmark type building to what it used to be, and by having this type of security available, will be a good opportunity for the neighborhood to, I think, make sure that we have a good business in there that's looking to the neighbors, working with the neighbors, and also hiring local.

We did have a discussion about minority participation and the people working in the organization. I think if they want to speak to that, they can. But it was good to see that they brought along several people who work within the company, including a gentleman who was a veteran, a Hispanic veteran, who talked to both the wages and the health care benefits for all their employees.

So we covered a lot of different bases. Everything from parking, alleys, all the way up to the types of benefits they provide. And I do support this change at this time.

[Speaker 1] (2:53:03 - 2:53:07)
Questions for the alderman or the applicant? Alderman David Moore.

[Speaker 6] (2:53:08 - 2:55:13)
Yes. Thank you, Chairman. I just want to make some comments.

And I want to thank their team for sitting with me and going and answering some of my questions. I just want to make clear, as we look at the employees' makeup of this company, I really want them to do better there. They've made some attempts, even in management, they've made some great attempts.

But I want to just push them to do better in their hiring of minorities and African-Americans in particular, especially as we talk about having social equity and diversity on here. What I am happy to hear is that, and I was able to talk to some of the African-American companies who are seeking to get licenses, that Pharmacan has assisted them as they should be doing, both financially and a big part with the intellectual piece in helping them get their applications in so that they can compete. I was happy to hear that.

What I was even greater and happy in hearing is that, what I was even happier about hearing was that they were not asking for a 10% piece of their business. It's just they get, you know, the licenses. And so some of these companies, I would encourage other companies to take a page from Pharmacan.

And because what's happening in our theory as many times is that you can help these companies, these African-American, these social equity companies get started, but then you ask for a piece of their business in time as they go down the road, buy them out. And so that's not this case. And I want to thank Pharmacan for not being one of those businesses that do that.

And with that said, that gives me great confidence in supporting this ordinance, not only that matter, but I know that Alderman Scott Wagesback has done his due diligence as well. That gives me great confidence in supporting this ordinance. So thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:55:14 - 2:55:20)
Other questions or comments? For the application? Alderman Scott Wagesback.

[Speaker 24] (2:55:21 - 2:55:51)
I just want to thank Alderman Moore as well, because I thank and Pharmacan for sitting down with him. I think that's the way these things should operate. And working together to improve those social equity aspects are important.

So during our meeting that came up, and I know it did after about what we were trying to do to make sure that the concerns of the Black and Latino Caucus were listened to. And taken seriously, and then see movement in that direction. So I appreciate his comments as well.

Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:55:51 - 2:56:08)
Congratulations, Alderman. And I'm going to ask for a motion to move to pass on this item. Alderman David Moore moves to pass on this item.

All those in favor? Any opposed? Can you chair the ayes have it?

Report it out on Wednesday.

[Speaker 39] (2:56:09 - 2:56:09)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:56:10 - 2:56:40)
Thank you. Thanks, Katrina. And we're now on the bottom of page 14.

Document number 20113, 27th Ward. Ordinance was referred on July 24th of 19. Common address is 158 through 184 North Ada Street, and 1353 through 1367 West Lake Street.

The change request, residential business plan development number 1384 to residential business plan development number 1384 as amended.

[Speaker 3] (2:56:42 - 2:57:25)
Thank you. Hi again. And for the last time, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Sarah Barnes, and I'm an attorney with the offices of Sam Banks. Before I begin, and as a preliminary matter, this was before the Chicago Plan Commission at its public hearing on February 20th. Sorry, February 21st, 2020, wherein it received unanimous approval for a recommendation for approval from all of the members of the Chicago Plan Commission.

As such, I do request that the transcript and exhibit, from that hearing, please be adopted into the record here today.

[Speaker 1] (2:57:27 - 2:57:40)
So I get a motion from Alderman Rabois to incorporate the records from the Plan Commission. All those in favor? Any opposed?

Hearing none, the ayes have it. Records are incorporated. Continue.

[Speaker 3] (2:57:40 - 2:59:55)
Thank you. And towards that same end, Alderman Burnett was present at the Plan Commission hearing and did voice his support for this proposal on the record at that time. This is a technical amendment with regard to one of the uses within the plan development.

As you can see from the slides above, this building is already constructed pursuant to all proper permits and pursuant to the original plan development. When first initiated, the intent was for a predominantly all-residential development multi-unit apartment building with many amenities for the residents. Towards that end, the grade-level space that's at issue here today was intended to be a cafe for the residents of the building itself.

After the building was up and occupied, the property owners started getting a lot of interest from the other residents and business owners within the area to perhaps open that space up to the public. It's intended to be, again, a cafe and bar. So unfortunately, the original plan development statements did not cover a public bar or restaurant establishment within the building.

We're here today just seeking to, again, a technical amendment to the plan development to allow to convert that purely residential space into a public tavern-slash-restaurant cafe. It's a very small space with very small occupancy. With that, we did go back to the various community groups, the West Loop Community Organization, the West Chamber Association, as well as the neighbors of West Loop to discuss the proposal with them.

It was actually those same groups and members of them that desired for this to be a public offering, and as well, we have been working with Alderman Burnett throughout the process. With that, there's not a whole lot more bells and whistles. I believe that Alderman Burnett has stated or reaffirmed his support to the members of the committee, or at least to the chairman, and I'm happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (2:59:56 - 3:00:15)
The Alderman has voiced his support for this item. I was at plan commission with him. I have a question, though, because to me, it's a no-brainer why this wasn't in the original plan.

I know it's what we thought would be lobby space is now going to be cafe space.

[Speaker 3] (3:00:16 - 3:00:31)
Yeah, it was actually always intended to be, it had a small, very small kitchen. It was always intended to be a gathering space within the lobby. It was just intended to be only for the residents of the building.

[Speaker 1] (3:00:31 - 3:00:32)
So it's the idea of bringing the outside in.

[Speaker 3] (3:00:32 - 3:00:37)
And now it's going to be commercial use, so to speak, because it will be open to the members of the public.

[Speaker 1] (3:00:37 - 3:00:40)
Okay, and just, were you the attorney on the original?

[Speaker 3] (3:00:41 - 3:00:43)
I was not, so I can't.

[Speaker 1] (3:00:43 - 3:00:44)
So you would have caught that from the beginning.

[Speaker 3] (3:00:44 - 3:00:55)
I for sure would have just included that, which I think it was intended. No, this one's actually on the, I think, the developer. I don't think it was his intent the whole time.

[Speaker 1] (3:00:55 - 3:01:15)
Okay, great. Questions, comments? Can I get a motion to move do pass as revised?

Alderman Raboyas moves do pass as revised. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Opinion chair, the ayes have it. This item is passed as revised.

[Speaker 3] (3:01:16 - 3:01:16)
Thank you so much.

[Speaker 1] (3:01:16 - 3:02:30)
All right, so now we are on the top of page 15. We are on document number 20231, 27th Ward. Ordinance was referred on October 16th of 19.

Common address 723 through 741 West Randolph, 101 through 133 North Halsted, and 724 through 740 West Washington. Change request DX5 Downtown Mixed Use District to DX7 Downtown Mixed Use District, as well as DX7 Downtown Mixed Use District and residential business plan development number 1230 to residential business plan development number 1230 as amended. For not clarification to reminder, there were two of the speakers in the public comment period that were not in support of this application.

And I think there were members from Unite here, if I'm not mistaken. So that being said, Rich, are you going to bring the presentation in front of us?

[Speaker 2] (3:02:30 - 3:03:08)
Yes, again, for the record, Rich Clowder with DLA Piper. I represent the applicant, which in this case is Randolph Halsted LLC. It's a limited liability company controlled by Related Midwest, a very prominent developer in and around Chicago.

As the chairman mentioned, this property is located in the west loop on the block bounded by the Kennedy Expressway on the east, Halsted Street on the west, Randolph on the north, and Washington on the south. The matter was before the plan commission on February 21st, 2020, where it received a recommendation for approval. Therefore, I'd like to ask that the transcript of that hearing be incorporated into the record of today's proceeding.

[Speaker 1] (3:03:10 - 3:03:24)
All right. So I'm going to ask Alderman Kappelman move to incorporate the plans from the plan commission. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? Hearing none, the records are incorporated.

[Speaker 2] (3:03:25 - 3:07:15)
Very briefly, the procedural history of this is a little bit complicated, but suffice it to say that originally the property was rezoned to plan development 1230 and then most recently was amended in July of 2018 to permit the construction of the first building, which was a 58-story building, which included 370 residential units, as well as a hotel and building with a sizable health club. Last year, the developer was able to acquire additional property on the block, giving it virtual control of the entire block, with the only exception being the Haymarket Brewery site, which will remain on the site. That, in turn, allowed the developer to program an additional building on this site, and it's that building which prompted this amendment and is intended to be an approximately 18-story commercial office building with ground floor retail.

The site now in total is about 75,000 square feet. It's a significant, iconic gateway project for the West Loop bi-related Midwest. The overall project FAR of 11.5 is achieved through a combination of previously approved bonuses, as well as a neighborhood opportunity bonus. This was the subject of a very robust community process. I did want to acknowledge the people who did speak about this project a couple of hours ago now. Just to clarify for the committee's benefit, the 370 residential units that were approved were approved a year and a half ago.

At that time, 220 of those units had been previously approved on a project that was approved several years prior to that. When that project was approved, it was the subject of a $540,000 bonus payment to be made to the Affordable Housing Trust Fund. So that left 150 remaining units to fulfill under the ARO.

Remember that the 2015 ARO did not, but the new Near North pilot ARO did require a 20% affordable requirement. What Related is elected to do is to provide the first 10% or 15 units on-site to households whose incomes are at or below 60% of AMI. The other 15 units will be provided off-site to tenants whose incomes are at or below 80% or 100% of AMI within the boundaries of the Near North pilot program.

And in addition, and very importantly, I'm pleased to note that because of the community process and a number of concerns that were expressed along the way, the developer along the way agreed to provide an additional 10 units of affordable housing off-site. So their commitment is above and beyond what was minimally required. They are fulfilling their requirements through a combination of ARO bonus from the legacy plan development that was approved several years ago.

And then they're also providing the pilot requirement add-on through a combination of onsite and off-site affordable housing units. As you know, just immediately to the west of this project, a plan commissioned several months ago, 906 West Randolph was approved. That does have a 20% ARO on-site requirement.

And Related obviously receives lots of accolades for their luxury apartment development, but they are also the largest affordable housing developer within the city limits. So I think this is a very good balance that they've struck here that has received a lot of robust input from the community. And we would ask for this committee's favorable recommendation to send us on to the city council.

All right. Happy to take any questions. And I don't know if committee members can see, but there have been a number of different renderings projected on the screen behind you.

[Speaker 1] (3:07:15 - 3:07:16)
All right. Alderman Maria Haddon.

[Speaker 2] (3:07:18 - 3:07:19)
Thank you, Chair.

[Speaker 10] (3:07:20 - 3:07:45)
Thank you for the breakdown and kind of going through the history of this project. That was helpful. You mentioned 10% on-site, and then you broke it down not in percentages, but you talked about kind of another 15 units off-site within the near north boundaries and an additional 10 units off-site.

What does that bring you to on the percentage, though, for this project of affordable units?

[Speaker 2] (3:07:46 - 3:08:07)
So 300, help me do the math if you would. 370 units have been approved. OK.

220 units were approved under the prior ARO, or under the prior, before the 2015 ARO. So out of the 370 units that are proposed.

[Speaker 1] (3:08:07 - 3:08:12)
Hold on a second. The 220, was there an in-lieu payment?

[Speaker 2] (3:08:12 - 3:08:13)
Yes, there was an in-lieu payment.

[Speaker 1] (3:08:13 - 3:08:15)
Just put that down. Put that in.

[Speaker 2] (3:08:15 - 3:08:25)
Yeah. So that was, there's a combination here of in-lieu, on-site, and off-site. But let's just keep to this.

So 370 units in the building.

[Speaker 10] (3:08:25 - 3:08:27)
How many units of affordable housing total?

[Speaker 2] (3:08:28 - 3:09:01)
So in the building, there will be 15 affordable units at 60% of AMI. And then there will be 25 units provided off-site within the boundaries of the pilot area to households whose incomes are at 80% or 100% of AMI. So a total of 40 units of affordable housing through a combination of on-site and off-site.

So slightly over 10% through the combo of on-site and off-site.

[Speaker 10] (3:09:01 - 3:09:03)
And that is in addition to the in-lieu of payment?

[Speaker 2] (3:09:03 - 3:09:04)
Yes, correct.

[Speaker 10] (3:09:04 - 3:09:12)
Which covers what percentage? So it's a little bit more complicated. I know it's of the 220, but what was the percentage of in-lieu of payments at the project at the time?

[Speaker 2] (3:09:15 - 3:09:36)
So under the prior zoning ordinance, there wasn't an ARO requirement. So they used a series of bonuses, one of which was a contribution to the Affordable Housing Trust Fund to build their bonus stack, if you will, because you'll remember that. So not necessarily equivalent in the same way because it was different guidelines.

It's hard to compare apples to apples.

[Speaker 10] (3:09:37 - 3:11:42)
So I'm wondering, and this is, as you mentioned, Related is a very reputable, large, wealthy developer with a robust portfolio of affordable housing units as well that it's wonderful that they do it, but they make a lot of money off of it. So looking at this, and especially with the acquisition of additional property, I realize it's in you guys' opinion that you're providing enough units. But I'm wondering, especially it's hard not to look at the current crisis that we're in.

We're scrambling, right? We're already as a city in a huge, I guess, dearth of affordable housing units. And especially with a partner as capable as Related, I think we need your clients to step up and help us even more.

So I'd be really curious, especially because this project has changed so much. I just wonder, can we get to that 20% within the boundaries? Because you're just over 10%.

And even though the rules have changed, we're still kind of processing through. So I just will note on the record, I'm wondering if you could provide through the chair. I know that Alderman Burnett's not present either.

So if you guys could provide information about with everything you've done, what is the equivalency? Can they do more? Because I won't hold up here in committee, because we've been here for so long.

And this is a complex project. And the alderman's not here to speak to it. But I would like to wonder if you guys can share some more information through the chair about what else Related can do to hit that 20% or the equivalency.

Because you're some of our biggest developers. And we need your commitment to the affordable housing in order to start making a dent in the numbers that we've gotten hit. So thank you for sharing what you've got.

[Speaker 2] (3:11:42 - 3:12:33)
You're welcome. And Commissioner, I just wanted to point out that what's prompting this amendment is not the expansion of the residential uses or the apartment building. It's really just the opportunity that became available to actually kind of square out the site and allow for an 18-story office building.

So the approvals that would have related to the residential were obtained over a year and a half ago. I can't speak for Related. I mean, I'll let their record speak for itself.

And I'll make Kurt, Bailey, and others available to you. I think if you talk to Alderman Burnett, he would rave about their commitment to community outreach and affordable housing. So I'm hoping that this can be approved on that basis.

But I would make available to you through the chair and directly representatives of Related who I think can speak more to their strategy on affordable issues across the city.

[Speaker 1] (3:12:34 - 3:12:37)
Information through the chair, which we will get to Alderman Haddon.

[Speaker 2] (3:12:37 - 3:12:50)
Absolutely. And Alderman, I would also very much agree to make their team available for a meeting with you just so that I think you can introduce yourselves. Because I think you do have aligned interests in many respects.

[Speaker 10] (3:12:50 - 3:12:59)
We've met, though I've had some trouble getting them to respond to some emails about some renovations they're doing on a project in the 49th Ward. So yeah, that'd be great. OK, no problem.

[Speaker 2] (3:12:59 - 3:13:00)
Consider it done.

[Speaker 1] (3:13:01 - 3:13:05)
All the more reason, Alderman. All right, Alderman David Moore.

[Speaker 6] (3:13:06 - 3:13:24)
Yes, I was just on the phone with Alderman. He's going to call me back and give me an opportunity to speak with Mr. Bernanke. Because how many more items we have?

Because I don't want to call a quorum on this thing. But I need to have a conversation with Mr. Bernanke before we pass this thing.

[Speaker 1] (3:13:26 - 3:13:29)
We have two more after this, Alderman.

[Speaker 6] (3:13:30 - 3:13:42)
OK, I think I can have that conversation before that. So I'm just asking if we would just pass on this right now until I have that conversation with the Alderman and Bernanke.

[Speaker 1] (3:13:42 - 3:13:48)
All right, our records show that we have the support of Alderman Bernanke, just for the record.

[Speaker 6] (3:13:48 - 3:13:56)
Will you hold this? I'm not asking to hold it. I'm just saying if we can pass on it until we finish these other two up.

[Speaker 1] (3:13:56 - 3:13:59)
I mean, yes, we're going to go through the other two. And then we'll come back to it.

[Speaker 6] (3:13:59 - 3:14:01)
Right, that's all I'm asking. OK. Right.

[Speaker 1] (3:14:01 - 3:14:40)
I wasn't going to. We'll get through the other two and come back to it. All right, let's move on to the middle of page 15.

Document number 20237T1 in the 27th Ward. The ordinance was referred on November 13th of 19. Common address is 1035 through 1065 North Orleans Street and 325 through 333 West Hill Street.

The change request, RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to a DX5 downtown mixed-use district.

[Speaker 32] (3:14:41 - 3:14:58)
All right. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman. Michael Esger on behalf of the applicant 1065 NOS LLC.

And as a preliminary matter, we do have substitute narrative and plans on file. And I wanted to incorporate those into the record. All right.

[Speaker 1] (3:14:59 - 3:15:15)
So Alderman Wogsback moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type one application. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Hearing none, the substitute narrative is accepted and in front of us. Thank you.

[Speaker 32] (3:15:16 - 3:15:57)
The existing building that is the former Immaculate Conception of St. Joseph's School is being preserved in this proposal. And the eight-story addition is being added for a hotel use. And the project went through a extensive community process with the Near North Unity Programs Development Committee and public hearings where the alderman was in attendance.

And it got a favorable review and a favorable finding. And although he's not here, I understand that Alderman Burnett is in support of the project. Yeah.

[Speaker 1] (3:15:58 - 3:16:22)
Alderman Burnett is in support of the item. All right. Questions?

So I know when I looked at this, we're saving the school? That's correct. And then this novel architecture, I'm putting on top of the school, right?

[Speaker 32] (3:16:22 - 3:16:22)
Correct.

[Speaker 1] (3:16:22 - 3:16:28)
Correct. Zoning, neighborhood was fine with the way it was designed that way?

[Speaker 32] (3:16:29 - 3:16:42)
It was. And there was some interest. Obviously, it's a unique, more modern design.

And there was discussion on it. Ultimately, everyone was in favor of the Wheeler-Kerns ideas about how to do this.

[Speaker 1] (3:16:46 - 3:16:52)
So floors one and two, which was the school, is that going to be the public space for the hotel?

[Speaker 32] (3:16:52 - 3:17:09)
So it'll be like the hotel lobby. There'll be some commercial space, a restaurant. Typical hotel sort of amenities.

There's a banquet facility in the basement and in the first floor. And then the hotel keys are above.

[Speaker 1] (3:17:09 - 3:17:45)
Rooms start above that, above the open space. OK. I've seen a lot of buildings.

This is interesting. All right. All right, questions, comments?

I said enough, I guess. So all right. So Scott Wogsback moves a due pass with the substantive narrative and plans.

All those in favor? Any opposed? Opinion chair, the ayes have it.

And it will be passed with this substitute narrative and plans. All right.

[Speaker 32] (3:17:45 - 3:17:46)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:17:48 - 3:18:21)
On page 16, top of page 16, document number 20152, first ward. Ordinance was referred on September 18th of 19. Common address 1420 North Milwaukee Avenue.

The change request to B3-2 Community Shopping District to a B3-3 Community Shopping District. Who's up on this one? Rich, are you up on this?

Are you back? No, you're not up on Milwaukee.

[Speaker 2] (3:18:23 - 3:18:24)
Well, wait, wait, wait, wait.

[Speaker 1] (3:18:24 - 3:19:48)
We're on a different application right now. We're looking from Samuel Bank. Well, OK.

Why don't we do this? If we're ready to go, before we defer this item on Milwaukee, if it's the will of the committee, do we want to move back to 723 West Randolph? All right.

So let's see if somebody from Sam Banks is around. Can you find what's going on with that? OK.

So all right. So we're going to go to Randolph, so to speak. All right.

So we're back on item number 20231, the 27th ward. This is the common address of 723 through 741 Randolph, 101 through 133 Halsted, and 724 through 740 West Washington. All right.

Updates. We want to hear Alderman, since you've asked to hold on this item. Do you want to give us updates on this or not?

[Speaker 6] (3:19:48 - 3:19:55)
I'm fine. I'm speaking to the parties at the company, and I just moved to pass on this item.

[Speaker 1] (3:19:56 - 3:20:20)
I don't think I would comment any further. Would you, Rich, or not? OK.

All right. So we have a motion from Alderman David Moore to move to pass on the item as revised. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? I know we're going to be speaking with related.

It's going to be speaking with Marie Haddon. I would hope that that would be before Wednesday. OK.

[Speaker 2] (3:20:20 - 3:20:21)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (3:20:21 - 3:21:23)
And that will, you know, if it's the will on Wednesday, we'll pass it. If not, we'll figure out what to do with it at that point. All right.

So before we adjourn, I want to know if anyone's here from the item on 1420 Milwaukee. No luck? Mike?

No luck? All right. We don't have a letter?

OK. So we don't have enough information to that. So I'm going to ask for a motion to defer.

Alderman Maria Haddon moves to defer. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Nope. All right.

So this item is deferred. Now I need a motion to adjourn. Alderman Scott Waguespack moves to adjourn.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

Hearing none, this meeting is adjourned. Thank you, folks.
