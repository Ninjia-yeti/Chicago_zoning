All right.

[Speaker 14] (13:44 - 13:48)

[Speaker 1] (13:49 - 14:47)
We have you recorded for quorum. Alderman Burnett is present. Also, thank you.

Postman present postman is present. Anyone else. Alderman Villegas is for the quorum also.

All right. Can I get a motion to move to defer these previously items by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Alderman, I think Mike Rodriguez made the first effort.

Any objections. Objections. Hearing no objections, these items have been deferred.

We will now move on to the public comment commentary portion of the meeting. We have five public speakers signed up for today's hearing, and we will hear from them now. All right, speaker number one Bernita Turner, Bernita.

[Speaker 20] (14:48 - 17:49)
Good morning. Good morning. Proceed.

Good morning Chairman Tooney and committee members. My name is Bernita Turner, and I am president of West Chatham Improvement Association. Short WCIA WCIA was established in 1946.

76 years later, we are still fighting for a safe, healthy community. Our concerns and objections to project number. Oh, as an Oscar 2022 dash 1159 buddy bear car wash has been submitted to all the members including over 750 signatures of objection.

This project was brought to our attention four years ago by Alderman Howard Brookings and Philip. The radio owner of buddy bear, and our objections were voiced at an emergency standing room only meeting. We thought our voices had been heard loud and clear.

May of 2022 another emergency standing room only meeting was held as notice buddy bear was headed to the planning committee in August. Again, louder and more forcefully objections were made. Our objections were made to buddy bear and Alderman Brookings support of this project as the community of West Chatham felt we had been betrayed.

The objections expressed were not heard and seem to have fell on deaf ears. We asked. I'm sorry, buddy bear was denied in the by Alderman Patrick Thomas in the 11th Ward with 200 signatures from his residence.

And we are asking that the zoning committee, hear our voices of 700 and plus signatures and vote against rezoning of this project. There is currently a buddy bear already in the 21st Ward, less than a mile away. We have five.

I repeat, five car washes, less than a half a mile away. Currently, in our community and a six one we don't see a need for. We had been asking for years for for the development of the vacant area in the Chatham market to include a family oriented restaurant to further renovate the vacant land property.

So again, I asked you to please hear our please with our documents, our objections as stated on the paperwork that has been submitted to you. I thank you for hearing my objections. And it's been a privilege.

Thank you so much.

[Speaker 1] (17:49 - 18:11)
Thank you, Bernita, so the committee members have received the petitions in opposition to this car wash. So just for the record, Miss Turner. Those have been distributed to committee members.

All right. Our next speaker is Laura. Laurel panel.

Laura. Lotto panel. Sorry about that.

[Speaker 28] (18:12 - 18:55)
Hi, good morning, committee. My name is Laura Campano. I didn't hear my address.

I live in the little village community. It was epic zone alpha 8761 address 2130 South Albany. I wanted to ask, I didn't really get a detailed description of what what the city plans to do with that empty lot next to my house.

And I just wanted to ask Alderman Scott if he's present, what are his plans for that lot. He's available or somebody explained to me because I didn't get a detailed letter of what the city wants to do with that empty lot next to my house.

[Speaker 1] (18:57 - 19:19)
Alright, so we will be entertaining that series of buildings in the 24th ward under all the woman Scott's leadership and this is ultimately single family homes I believe. But stay tuned because they'll be on the agenda probably within the next hour. All right, our next speaker.

Lori Baldwin.

[Speaker 29] (19:27 - 19:50)
Good morning. Morning is this morning representative of the West Chatham community, and I am petitioning against the approval of the Betty bear car wash requesting that the Sony approval be denied for the following reasons. So, excuse me, excuse me, would you identify yourself for the record, please.

I'm sorry, I'm a Lori Baldwin. Okay resident of West Chatham.

[Speaker 1] (19:51 - 19:52)
Thank you. Continue please.

[Speaker 29] (19:55 - 21:24)
West Chatham is the only adjacent community to this commercial zone, and will have the only direct impact to this development, both 83rd Street and Whitworth Avenue are directly across the street and alleyway from the Chatham market. Access water flow from this project will create added stress to an already strange drainage system homes adjacent to this project flood, and could be mitigated with a solid building structures and plan vegetation on this land, and therefore we would rather have other buildings and other properties that would develop this land. Increasing job opportunities would be more conducive to our community.

This project only will create two, possibly three jobs. It is not in the best use for this commercial property development to increase value to our community. We have, as our president stated, and many times told that we were not interested in the car wash.

It has been disregarded. And there so I would like to also mention that it seems the incumbent auto has totally ignored our input that this be tabled until we have a decision made in the new automatic election for someone to really hear us and represent us. Thank you so very much.

[Speaker 1] (21:27 - 21:31)
All right, thank you. Our next speaker Gloria Banderas.

[Speaker 46] (21:41 - 21:43)
Good morning, how are you my name is.

[Speaker 1] (21:44 - 21:45)
Good morning.

[Speaker 46] (21:48 - 22:49)
Good morning. My, my. I am calling I'm basically seconding.

Laura. I live next to an empty box. I'm going to be for development according to the letter we received in the 24 village, North Columbia.

We have not received any information. Matter of fact, my concern is that I've found myself to speak with the alderman of our ward when they used to be on 24th and Boulevard. It's been a place filled with drugs.

Nothing has ever been done. There's going to be construction so see that I live next to that last, I'm very concerned and I feel a little left out that we haven't had any information at all. So, basically, I just want to know the who, what, you know, things like that.

[Speaker 1] (22:49 - 23:43)
All right, again, this is an initiative I think that aldermans Michael Scott had working with Cook County on putting new single family homes in affordable single family homes. Obviously the new older woman Scott has following in that tradition so it notices been sent, but articulate. My staff tells me the, what is actually happening on these lots are not fully understandable from the notice.

So stay tuned we'll have, we'll have a list of all that I believe there's 20 plus pieces of property we're going to be looking at working with all the woman Scott, and they, I think, 100% or affordable housing. So, all right. Next speaker Gloria Davis.

[Speaker 23] (23:52 - 23:53)
Good morning.

[Speaker 1] (23:53 - 23:55)
Good morning, and you are.

[Speaker 23] (23:55 - 26:18)
I am Gloria J Davis I live at 1160 South Michigan in the condo building the Colombian. I'm not sure if the cannabis dispensary that is asking for approval at 48 East Roosevelt is on your agenda, but I did want to speak to that. I'm a retired school superintendent that lives in the condo building, and I am very concerned about a Canada's cannabis dispensary being open right behind our building with two schools in near proximity of the area.

Jones College prep, as well as South Loop Elementary School. I have a serious concern, also that the building itself which is the current potbelly restaurant, which I understand is going to be empty. And that's where the proposed location will be.

There is no parking or only five parking spaces right behind the building, which is also the driveway or alleyway, where the garage for the garage where cars come in and out, right next to a trader Joe's it's a very busy intersection there at Roosevelt and Wabash, and all the traffic and what is possibly going to be even more traffic with a dispensary there I think is just hugely inappropriate for the community and for the area. We have lots of buildings still going up with more residents the traffic is already a huge problem on any event from football games and soldier field, and so on.

I'm also concerned about the crime, and the possibility of crime that this dispensary will bring, and I just would ask that the planning committee gives serious serious consideration to not approving this request but as I said my biggest concern is a former educator, that is in a neighborhood where lots of children are walking back and forth to school and I just don't think it would be appropriate so I appreciate your consideration, my request, and I look forward to the results of this dispensary. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (26:21 - 26:25)
Thank you. Our next speaker, Emily coffee.

[Speaker 19] (26:25 - 29:25)
Good morning chairman and members of the zoning committee. My name is Emily coffee, and I am the senior counsel and director of equitable community development and housing at Chicago lawyers committee for civil rights, along with legal action Chicago and the National Housing Law Project. I represent the Chicago housing initiative and Virginia Burns Hope Center and opposing the rezoning of DHA lands for Chicago fire practice facility.

This proposal will continue patterns of economic and racial segregation, contrary to the city's obligations to comply with civil rights laws. This facility is proposed to be built on the former site of Abla home. The land is subject to a declaration of trust, and to be used exclusively for public and affordable housing.

As part of its plan for transformation, the DHA displaced thousands of Abla residents with the promise that they could return to the new or rehabilitated units, and to their historic community. This area offers easy access to good job, high quality health care shopping parks, universities, and many other amenities in Chicago city center access that thousands of DHA families once had, and lost over the past two decades, as the plan for transformation pushed families out to the far south and far west side. This site used to have 3600 public housing units.

The vast majority of these units were torn down with the promise of replacement as mixed income housing, yet the numbers of deeply affordable units committed to have only dwindled over time, as our city faces an ever increasing affordable housing crisis. Two decades after residents were forced out, DHA has only built 245 new units and only has approved plans to build 80 more in 20 years. The DHA delays in delivering replacement units cannot serve as the basis to jettison a vital supply of coveted available public housing land.

The city has a duty not to discriminate and to comply with the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits policies and practices with the intent or effect of discriminating against members of a protected class. It also has an obligation to affirmatively further fair housing. This proposal would allow more than 25 acres of DHA land located in a rapidly gentrifying community and long intended to be used as public housing, which primarily serves families of color and people with disabilities, to be released for private development by a private sports team.

This action fails to address the ongoing needs for replacement housing in the Oslo community, while offloading more than half of the remaining land available for redevelopment. The proposal before you today does not include the creation or funding of a single new public housing unit. This proposal needs to be taken back to the drawing board, as it does not comply with the city's obligations under civil rights law.

I urge you to reject it today. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (29:28 - 30:58)
Thank you. That concludes the public speaking portion of the hearing. We are now going to start off with code amendment on the addendum to the agenda.

Document number 02022-2008. Mayoral ordinance introduced June 22nd of 2022, repealing the existing title 14N, parentheses, the 2019 Chicago Energy Conservation Code, and replacing it with a new title 14N, which is a revised 2022 Chicago Energy Transformation Code. The item has a substitute.

All members of the committee should have received a copy of the substitute, as well as a one-page summary, I believe, electronically. And at this time, I would ask for a motion to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Can I get a motion to accept the substitute?

So moved, Mr. Chairman. Alderman Austin. Alderwoman Austin makes the motion to accept the substitute.

Any objections? Hearing none, the substitute's in front of us. We have Commissioner Matt Beaudet of the building department here to present on the matter.

And during our briefing, Matt, it sounds like there's a lot of cleanup and some compliance with national standards and something that revised of the code every three years. So let's start with the revisions, please, Commissioner. Sure.

[Speaker 7] (30:59 - 34:08)
Good morning, Chairman. This is Grant Ulrich, Managing Deputy Commissioner. Commissioner Beaudet and First Deputy Hopkins are dealing with a building emergency, so I will be speaking this morning.

So good morning, Chairman and members of the committee. Again, my name is Grant Ulrich. I'm Managing Deputy in the Department of Buildings.

Commissioner Beaudet would have liked to have been here, and I think he enjoyed the briefings they did with several of you. The department would like to thank Mayor Lightfoot, her sustainability team, and the City Council for their continuing leadership on addressing these energy and sustainability issues with an equity focus. I am here today to ask for your favorable consideration of the 2022 Energy Transformation Code, which, as Chairman said, will replace the 2019 Energy Conservation Code.

This ordinance represents the city's ongoing commitment to address energy and climate issues, and to do so in a cost effective and equitable manner. In April of 2019, the City Council adopted the 2019 Energy Conservation Code, which made significant progress, and we are here today to continue that progress. Both the 2019 and 2022 codes are based on the International Model Energy Codes, which are updated every three years to incorporate the latest technology and practices.

One question that you may have is why is this changing its name from the Energy Conservation Code to the Energy Transformation Code? Simply put, we know that as a city and a society, we need to address not just energy conservation, energy savings, but also to transition to a clean energy future for ourselves and future generations. This includes preparing for the electrification and solar energy in new buildings that are going to be part of our city's building stock for decades and generations.

Energy transformation requirements are also proven to provide monetary savings for Chicago's residents and small businesses, especially with rising energy costs. The U.S. Department of Energy has determined that the new model code represents a 9.4% energy savings improvement and an 8.7% improvement in carbon emissions for residential buildings relative to our last model code, and this will save homeowners an average of $2,320 over the life of a typical mortgage. The new model code is also estimated to result in a 5% energy savings for commercial buildings relative to the prior model code.

There's also a number of ways in which the new energy code will exceed the model code baseline and advance the city of Chicago's decarbonization commitments, and those are summarized, I believe, in the handout that you received. By being among the first to adopt requirements based on the 2021 model code, the city of Chicago will be at the front of the line to apply for $1 billion in federal financial assistance that was recently authorized under the Inflation Reduction Act. The U.S. Department of Energy will begin releasing those funds next year to support local training and other activities. We're also excited that homeowners and businesses who build under the Energy Transformation Code in a very efficient way will be eligible for a range of energy efficiency rebates and tax credit programs that were created or expanded under the Inflation Reduction Act. Again, my thanks to Mayor Lightfoot, Chief Sustainability Officer Angela Tovar, the City Council, and others for their leadership on this vital matter. Thank you for your time, and I ask for your favorable consideration.

I'm happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (34:08 - 34:37)
All right, Grant. Questions from committee members? Did we also send an update on what the substitute did?

Okay. All right. Grant, do me a favor and just talk about in the substitute, what were some of the minor changes based on stakeholder feedback?

[Speaker 7] (34:38 - 35:21)
Absolutely. So this was introduced in June. We had some ongoing conversations, so we did not present it in July.

We're presenting it now. We did get some feedback from architects, engineers, builders, others who looked at it. They pointed out some wording changes that could make it tighter, some coordination issues with other provisions of our existing code, so we were able to incorporate those.

Really, the substance did not change of anything that was proposed, but we did have some coordination items and cleaned up some wording to make it, again, clearer to everyone who's going to have to follow this code as we implement it starting this fall. The other thing that changed, because we did have it heard this month instead of in July, the effective date for some of the provisions changed from September to November.

[Speaker 1] (35:21 - 35:48)
All right. So let's talk about just the homeowner. Sure.

You talked about permit fees. You talked about roofing. I know we've talked about some of these items in our briefing session.

So for the benefit of the – how does this affect small business and individual homeowners as they either – more on the renovation side, right?

[Speaker 7] (35:49 - 36:51)
Sure. So, again, a lot of it deals with new construction, and again, for a homeowner who's buying a house that's built under this code as opposed to our last code, the energy savings actually balance out that they save more money. For renovation, again, the code is more flexible, recognizing that there's a range of conditions that are being dealt with, and it continues to have those provisions, recognizing that there are limitations to existing structures.

But we believe that it's cost-effective for renovation as well. It's going to drive new technologies into the market that are effective and efficient energy saving for both people doing new construction and doing renovation. So it's going to enable homeowners to do cost-effective renovations of their home that will save them energy.

And again, it's exciting that under the recent federal legislation that happened after we introduced this and before today's hearing, there are a range of rebates and tax credits that are coming from the federal government that are really going to help homeowners seeking to do those energy efficiency upgrades.

[Speaker 1] (36:51 - 37:12)
So, I'm a homeowner buying a new home. My understanding is that the home will have to be wired for electric appliances and also the ability, if I have an electric vehicle, to be part of the original construction rather than a very expensive renovation.

[Speaker 7] (37:13 - 38:19)
Yeah, that's correct. So for a new home starting with permits applied for January 1st or later of 2023, there is a requirement that if you are building with gas appliances for either cooking, so stove, oven, clothes drying, or hot water heating, if it's individual tier units, so a single family home or individual inside an apartment, that we are going to require at the time of new construction that the wiring and the electrical capacity be installed. So if, when you choose to switch out that gas appliance, the electrical capacity is going to be there.

It's a few hundred dollars in extra cost to do that up front. It's several thousand dollars to retrofit that later and also a lot of time and hassle with ComEd if you have to do an electrical service upgrade. So we are excited about that electrification ready provision for new homes.

That's not going to apply to any renovation projects, but it's going to enable things that are newly built starting in January with permits starting in January to have that ease of converting.

[Speaker 1] (38:19 - 38:25)
So, normally, if I'm not mistaken, a house has about 100 amps to serve the house. Is that correct?

[Speaker 7] (38:26 - 38:36)
I would say probably most houses are being built with more capacity than that today because they have air conditioning systems, so they're probably more like 200 amp service for a new single family home.

[Speaker 1] (38:37 - 38:43)
And with these changes, 200 amps generally should be sufficient?

[Speaker 7] (38:43 - 39:09)
I think in most cases, yes, because again, it's a balance of increasing the efficiency of the building envelope, so reducing the amount of energy that's required to heat and cool it, as well as these. So, in most cases, it will not require change in service for a single family home. Again, for an apartment building, there's going to be some trade-offs, but again, they share walls and so there's some different efficiency things going on there.

[Speaker 1] (39:09 - 40:35)
Thank you, Grant. Any questions from committee members? All right.

With that, no further questions. Can I get a motion to move due pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Vice Chair Roboius moves due pass on this item.

Any objections? Hearing none, the ordinance is passed as amended. All right.

Thank you, Grant. Good luck on the department drama today. All right.

We'll now move on to four mayoral appointments. First, we have document number A-2022-116, the appointment of Danielle Tillman as a member of the Chicago Planning Commission for the term effective immediately and expiring on January 25th of 2026. To succeed, Linda A.

Searle, whose term has expired. I'll say that lightly because I think she served for over 20 years on the Planning Commission, so we wished her and thanked her for her service. All right.

All committee members should have received an electronic copy of Ms. Tillman's resume, and we have here to speak on the appointment. Danielle, you want to say a few words before we ask you a few questions if there are from committee members, please?

[Speaker 17] (40:36 - 41:21)
Yes. Hello. Thank you.

Good morning, Chairman Tunney and Zoning Committee members. It is my pleasure to come before you today. I am Danielle Tillman.

I am a licensed architect and currently the managing principal at BKL Architecture. Just a little bit about myself over the course of my career, I've been involved in a myriad of projects throughout the city of Chicago, including multifamily education and civic projects. It is and would be my distinct honor to serve the city in this manner as I look forward to working with the Planning Commission in order to provide the city with thoughtful and equitable architecture, design, urban planning, and development.

So thank you again for your time and your consideration.

[Speaker 1] (41:24 - 42:03)
Thank you, Ms. Tillman. Do we have questions, comments from committee members? I'll just start off by saying thank you for committing to this public service aspect.

BKL, I think it's a pretty well-known firm in the city. You commented a little bit about some of the public work projects and or work that you've done. Would you also tell us what your vision is from an equity lens in terms of the Planning Commission and maybe some of your projects in the past that might bring some light to this issue?

[Speaker 17] (42:04 - 43:20)
Yes. So as an architect, I truly do believe in design. I understand how to consider and think about buildings in a way that I believe creates equity throughout the design process.

So some of those projects that I've been involved with include the Whitney Young Library in the Chatham neighborhood, where we thought about the design and how that would relate to the community for a library within that neighborhood. Also working right now within the Woodlawn neighborhood on the Washington Park Bank building, which has gotten some press quite lately. Again, thinking about design and considering the effects that that can have on areas that have, quite honestly, not necessarily always been considered.

And so I think that that is a point that has been made, of course, through this administration and look forward to continuing that.

[Speaker 1] (43:23 - 43:31)
Thank you. One of my staffers is very familiar with Lathrop. Talk to us about Lathrop, please.

[Speaker 17] (43:31 - 44:59)
Yes. So we worked on the Lathrop project, of course, which is in the Bucktown and Roscoe Village neighborhoods. They're at Diversity, Clybourne, and Damon, and worked on the first new construction building within Lathrop.

And we're very proud of being able to, one, that community process, which was challenging and thoughtful. And then also understanding the historic process of that district, it being a historic district and being able to create a new construction building, which likened itself back to the history of the Lathrop project and the housing project or housing development that was there previously. So what we had to consider was how do you create 21st century living, but still considering 1930s architecture.

But we were able to do that, we think, quite well with a very handsome building and brickwork. But again, detailing it in a way that still considered design and brought that building to life.

[Speaker 1] (45:01 - 45:13)
Well, thank you very much. I do not see hands up. All right, can I get, can I get a motion to move to pass on this appointment by the same roll call that was used to determine.

[Speaker 47] (45:13 - 45:14)
Rodriguez.

[Speaker 1] (45:15 - 45:36)
Alderman Mike Rodriguez makes the motion any objections to the motion. Hearing none. Congratulations, and this appointment recommendation will be sent to the city council tomorrow.

So look forward to working with you on the planning commission, and thank you for your commitment to serve the city of Chicago in this capacity.

[Speaker 17] (45:37 - 45:39)
Thank you so much. I appreciate it.

[Speaker 1] (45:39 - 46:26)
All right. Next we have document number, a 2022 dash 117, the appointment of Claude that Soto, as a member of the Chicago planning commission for a term effective immediately and expiring on January 25, 2027 to succeed. Teresa, or Dover, whose term has expired.

And Teresa was our chairwoman for a number of years and want to thank her for her service, but our committee members should have received the background information from the Soto. Let's start with your introduction, please. Thank you.

[Speaker 21] (46:27 - 47:27)
Chairman Tony vice chair rebel yes and committee members, it's an honor to be before you for consideration on my appointment to the plan commission. My great grandparents settled here in Chicago in the 1920s from the state of high school in Mexico, and I am proud to say that I am a fourth generation Chicago and I was born and raised in the south side community of gauge park graduated from mother Macaulay High School, went on to obtain my undergraduate degree in architecture and my master's degree from the Illinois Institute of Technology, and upon graduation, I entered the field of construction management and owners rep services.

I've been in that field for the past 20 years, managing a variety of project types both public and private. And I look forward to serving and sharing my technical expertise and experiences growing up in Chicago, with my fellow members. So thank you again for your consideration.

[Speaker 1] (47:28 - 48:28)
All right, questions, comments from committee members. Let's see hands up. Well, I'm a brother rice grad so I have lots of good things to say about mother Macaulay.

Fantastic. And obviously you know from that schooling public services should be part of everyone's career at some point. So, in terms of the planning mechanism so construction management is one aspect, obviously, we need that expertise, but how do you plan to use your background.

And the planning perspective of the planning commission, you know when we evaluate sites what what what's going to be your. I'm sure you'll be well rounded in your focus but your expertise in your vision. Could you talk a little bit about that for the planning commission, please.

Sure.

[Speaker 21] (48:28 - 50:02)
So, the owner's rep field is actually a component where we're there from inception upon completion. So we help our clients actually build their, their budgets, when they want to start their projects and we leave them through the planning process. Little feedback.

We leave them through the planning process and I'm very familiar with the plan commission as well as zoning. So, back in the day I also served as a consultant, so the Department of Buildings from 2003 until 2007, where it was so busy that we actually had to do zoning reviews and analysis. So that helped to prepare me as well.

It also helped me coordinating with all the different city departments including CDOT, landscaping, you know, all the different departments that were needed in order to put a project up for plan commission. So in the 20 years that I've been working in this industry I've seen all types of projects, I've worked in affordable housing, managing those projects, educational infrastructure even and creating new streets. So the, the variety of the projects that I have experience on I think will be a great asset.

Also the fact that I have a degree in architecture and a degree in structural engineering, and that gives me a unique perspective when reviewing projects as well.

[Speaker 1] (50:03 - 50:22)
Thank you very much. Good answer, I must say. Other questions.

Hearing none. Can I get a motion to move to pass on this appointment by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. That Alderman Cardona on that one.

[Speaker 47] (50:22 - 50:22)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (50:23 - 51:25)
Alderman Cardona makes the motion to move to pass any objections to the motion. Hearing none. This appointment is approved by the committee and will be forwarded to the city council tomorrow.

And I believe you'll be immediately on the plan commission if the city council approves that so look forward to working with you. Thank you very much. All right.

Thank you. All right. Next.

Okay, next we have document number, a 2022 dash 124, the appointment of Jonathan, he fare as a member of the Commission on Chicago landmarks for term effective immediately and expiring on March 11 of 2023 to complete the unexpired term of Lynn J. who has resigned. Maybe members you should have received an electronic copy of the resume, we have him here to speak on his appointment.

So, Jonathan. Talk to us about landmarks and how you're going to save the city.

[Speaker 27] (51:25 - 53:12)
So, good morning. Thank you chairman Tony and the council. My name is Jonathan fair.

I'm a lifelong Chicago and born and raised in the Roseland community on the far south side. I'm a licensed architect, and in general and advocate for affecting change through design and built environment. I'm really excited and grateful for this opportunity to serve with the commission, because of its ability to help recount Chicago's rich history and culture through the built environment.

I work at the University of Illinois Chicago, as the director of planning and design where my team and I are responsible for the short and long term planning, as well as other decisions impacting our nearly 200 buildings throughout our campus. And doing so in a way that not only supports our academic research and healthcare missions but also ties it back to what our role is in the city at large and what that means to be a supporter of the city in general. For those of you all familiar with our campus.

You may know that we have a plethora of buildings that have both architectural and cultural significance to name a couple the Jane Addams whole house, as well as the UIC police station which is the former seventh district police station, as well as what may have some mixed opinions but a plethora of architecture buildings on our historic campus. Those buildings present some unique and complex decision making which are partaking on a day to day basis. So pending this council's approval I'm excited to embark on this work with the city at large, with the Department of Planning and Development and the historic preservation division.

[Speaker 1] (53:16 - 53:23)
Thank you, Jonathan. I see all the woman doll has her hand up on this appointment. All the woman doll.

[Speaker 8] (53:25 - 54:03)
Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to speak positive to positively on this nomination. Jonathan is a really bright star in our development community. I know of his work outside of what he does on a day to day basis in terms of supporting development and communities.

And I think it's great that we have such a young person with, you know, new ideas to be on the plan commission so I wanted to just support this nomination and move to pass.

[Speaker 1] (54:03 - 54:11)
All right. All the woman doll I believe Jonathan is an applicant for the landmark commission is that correct, whatever.

[Speaker 8] (54:12 - 54:21)
But we can get them on both. He could be on both. But I think it's a great nomination either way.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (54:21 - 54:46)
Alrighty. Thank you all the woman any other hands up on this appointment please. Alright, so Alderman Pat doll makes a motion move to pass on this appointment by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections to her motion. Hearing none, this appointment will be passed out of committee today and referred to the city council tomorrow. Good luck and look forward to working with you, Jonathan.

[Speaker 4] (54:47 - 54:47)
Thank you.

[Speaker 27] (54:47 - 54:48)

Oliver, as member of the Commission on Chicago landmarks for term effective immediately and expiring on March, 11 2023 committee members should have received a copy of his resume we have him here to speak on this appointment we have Mr. Reverend Tolliver. Okay.

That part I didn't know. All right. Well, you're you'll be reappointed I just I'm going to double check because normally those reappointments are for three or four year period so how many years have you been on the landmarks commission, several.

[Speaker 1] (57:28 - 57:32)
All right. Thank you all the woman doll. All the woman Carrie Austin.

[Speaker 29] (57:32 - 57:43)

[Speaker 6] (57:43 - 57:48)
So, we were praying that he can his extension will be a little longer.

[Speaker 1] (57:49 - 58:21)
Thank you. All right, I don't see other hands up so with that all the men carry Austin makes emotion to move do pass the same roll call that was used to determine quorum on the reappointment of Richard Tolliver. Any objections to our motion.

[Speaker 44] (59:59 - 1:00:00)

And if there's no questions by committee members, do I hear a motion to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Do I get a motion to pass? Alderman Sawyer makes the motion to move to pass.

Any objections to the motion? Hearing none, these orders are passed. We will now move on to the regular agenda in an effort to minimize technical difficulties and to ensure the committee meeting runs as smoothly as possible.

The typical order in which items will be heard has been updated throughout the duration of virtual committee and zoning meetings. Items will be grouped together according to witness attorney and will be heard in that order rather than the ward order. Oh, we have capable staff tells me that we need to go out of order.

So committee members, let's move to page nine. Top document number 20753 in the 46th ward. One common address 4030 North Marine Drive, also known as 640 West Irving Park.

This change request from an RT for residential to flat townhouse and multi unit district to an RM six residential multi unit district, and then to a residential plan development. And this item did pass plan commission, if I'm not mistaken.

[Speaker 14] (1:04:00 - 1:04:01)
I'm sorry, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:02 - 1:04:04)
I'm sorry, David Moore, what's up?

[Speaker 14] (1:04:05 - 1:04:17)
My page nine looks different from yours. I got something that came differently. I got at the top, I got 10th ward and following 10th and 11th, which one I got.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:18 - 1:04:29)
Okay, that's David, we're going to send you the revised agenda, sir. I think you're the previous one, so we'll get it to you right away, sir.

[Speaker 14] (1:04:29 - 1:04:30)
Thank you so much.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:31 - 1:04:49)
Okay. Change request from our T four to an hour six residential plan development as I said, past the plan commission I think this is the Immaculata, if I'm not mistaken corner of Irving. Yes, and American Islamic College Thank you staff.

All right.

[Speaker 4] (1:04:50 - 1:04:51)
Rolando, please.

[Speaker 12] (1:04:52 - 1:05:03)
Excuse me. Good morning Mr Chairman members of the committee Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant. It's a pleasure to bring this project before you.

Let us start with the chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:05:04 - 1:05:09)
David, David Moore would you mute please, when we get that. All right, Rolando continue.

[Speaker 12] (1:05:09 - 1:07:10)
As the chairman previously noted this is the formerly known as Immaculata high school property currently known as the American Islamic College property at the northwest corner of Irving Park and Marine Drive. The property is currently improved with a high school building that was built in the 1920s and then with an addition in 1950s. It is a Chicago landmark as well as a national landmark.

The proposal before you is to rehabilitate the existing building into residential units with a maximum of 245 units. There's also a large parking lot in the center of the site that is proposed to be developed with a senior building a 22 story senior building that will contain 192 units, and will include in the mix, assisted living as well as memory care and independent living units. The proposal was the building will contain it at space, approximately 98 parking spaces.

There's an approximate sorry 96 parking spaces. There's another 22 parking spaces that will be provided on an existing surface lot on Irving Park Road. This matter was reviewed by the Chicago landmark commission and approved.

It's also been preliminarily reviewed by the state landmark division, as well as the National Park Service personnel in terms of the proposed rehab as well as the construction of building, and it was favorably received. And we, and allowed us to proceed. It was the subject of extensive community process over a two year period that included more than 12 broad based community meetings in the area, which culminated in a meeting before alderman campelman's ward zoning and planning committee.

Lastly, Mr Chairman, it was before the Chicago plan commission on July 21 2022. And I would ask that the record before that body be incorporated in the proceedings before this body.

[Speaker 1] (1:07:11 - 1:07:24)
All right, we'll start with Vice Chair voice moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum objections to his motion. Hearing on the records are incorporated. Continue, please.

[Speaker 12] (1:07:24 - 1:07:33)
One more item Mr Chairman, I believe there is a substitute ordinance so you may have to move the substitute, as well as incorporating the records.

[Speaker 1] (1:07:34 - 1:07:40)
All right, Anna Robles. On. Is there a substitute.

[Speaker 5] (1:07:42 - 1:07:43)
Chairman Can you hear me.

[Speaker 1] (1:07:44 - 1:07:45)
I can hear you and a good morning.

[Speaker 5] (1:07:45 - 1:07:59)
Good morning. I'm looking at the documents sent to me, and I don't see a substitute for final publication that was stamped. So I would have to reach out to Noah if he's still on all.

[Speaker 38] (1:08:00 - 1:08:03)
I don't have a substitute I think the committee.

[Speaker 1] (1:08:03 - 1:08:06)
Hold on, hold on a second. Noah.

[Speaker 38] (1:08:07 - 1:08:22)
Yes, the, the substitute, the ordinance itself was not substituted but the findings of fact and documents from the plan commission need to be incorporated as those were revised, but the zoning ordinance itself remains as final ordinance being substituted.

[Speaker 1] (1:08:23 - 1:08:28)
Okay, Rolando. Agree with that, those statements.

[Speaker 12] (1:08:29 - 1:08:58)
Actually, Mr Chairman there was a technical change in the description in the ordinance in terms of the boundary, and I believe the staff has a substitute ordinance. Let me verify your staff committee staff. The only change was a directional change in terms of one of the boundaries.

And it was that way before, when it went before planning commission.

[Speaker 1] (1:09:02 - 1:09:04)
All right, I think Noah is checking on that.

[Speaker 12] (1:09:16 - 1:09:20)
I'm also checking but I hate delaying the committee.

[Speaker 1] (1:09:21 - 1:09:23)
But we don't want you to come back.

[Speaker 12] (1:09:24 - 1:09:37)
I don't want to come back either and I'm pretty certain there's a substitute because I noticed a an error in the legal description. This matter was also we noticed we published, and also reposted in terms of signage.

[Speaker 1] (1:09:37 - 1:09:42)
So, our committee says you're correct on that last statement.

[Speaker 38] (1:09:56 - 1:10:03)
He is correct. Chairman there was a directional change made we'll get that substitute in right now.

[Speaker 1] (1:10:06 - 1:10:26)
So, we'll wait for the substitute is that correct. I know it's minor but it needs to be correct before go to counsel. Okay, we don't have the substitute, how long will it be Noah.

We move on and can come back to this.

[Speaker 38] (1:10:28 - 1:10:30)
Yes, that would that would be perfect chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:10:30 - 1:10:43)
Okay, what we'll do, though. In the effort of Alderman Kaplan's time, since this is not a substantive issue. Alderman Kaplan I know you're on a time constraint, would you like to speak on this project.

[Speaker 45] (1:10:44 - 1:11:48)
Thank you, Chairman I really appreciate it. This was a project that started, I believe in all the public process started in January 2020. Many, many meetings.

But I was impressed with all the negotiations that took place between the community and the development team there was a lot of give and take on both sides, scoring wins and providing concessions. So, it's also a proposal that will provide some sorely needed housing that will address the high demand we're seeing in the north side, especially the senior housing, which will allow a lot of seniors. I'm one of them to age in place.

There's the committee that I have is worldwide. About 30 members, and we had 21 voting in favor, seven opposed and three abstaining so I, I agree with the 46 words only development committee that the benefits of this project far outweighed any negative repercussions so I asked my colleagues to support this as well.

[Speaker 1] (1:11:50 - 1:12:04)
Thank you Alderman Kaplan and I know how much work. This project was just being. Alright, so what we're going to do is we're going to wait for the substitute, because it's a technical substitute.

We have it.

[Speaker 23] (1:12:06 - 1:12:07)
What about to my committee members.

[Speaker 1] (1:12:10 - 1:12:40)
Okay, okay. All right. So we do have a copy of the substitute, which clarifies the directional issue that Mr Acosta talked about.

So, for the benefit of the committee we don't normally this kind of technical you don't get your own copy but I'm going to ask, based on my narrative, if I would. Someone would make the motion to accept the substitute. Vice Chair, was that Alderman Kaplan.

[Speaker 28] (1:12:40 - 1:12:41)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (1:12:42 - 1:13:08)
Okay. Alderman Wagesbeck makes the motion to accept the substitute any objections to his motion. Hearing on the substitute is in front of us.

We've talked about the change, and just for the benefit. And while Alderman Kaplan is here. Rolando this substitute, basically is a technical on a directional boundary of this PD.

[Speaker 12] (1:13:08 - 1:13:27)
Yes, Mr Chairman the original ordinance called out the wrong curve of, I believe it was bittersweet, and that this substitute does call out the correct curve. And as the substitute the boundary and the substitute was the subject of the new publication and you notice, as well as the new posting.

[Speaker 1] (1:13:28 - 1:13:29)
James Are you comfortable with this.

[Speaker 45] (1:13:30 - 1:13:33)
Yes, yes I'm very comfortable with it. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:13:33 - 1:13:42)
Okay, so the substitutes in front of us. Can I get a motion to move to pass on this ordinance as substitute.

[Speaker 32] (1:13:43 - 1:13:44)
Move to pass German.

[Speaker 1] (1:13:45 - 1:13:59)
Alderman Wagesbeck makes the motion to move to pass any objections to the motion. Hearing none. This item is passed as revised and substituted and substituted.

Okay.

[Speaker 12] (1:14:00 - 1:14:01)
Thank you. I'm sorry for the confusion.

[Speaker 1] (1:14:01 - 1:14:45)
All right, well we'd rather do it now than later. So, thanks. All right, now we're going back to page one.

And this is document number eight, eight, 8776 in the first ward the ordinance was referred on June 22 2022. The common address is 460 North noble street and the change request from an M one to limited manufacturing business part district to an RS three residential single unit detached house district. And this is in the first war.

And we have first ward staff on this call, please. On Noble Street.

[Speaker 32] (1:14:45 - 1:15:29)
Good morning Chairman Chairman Tony thanks so much for having me on the committee and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Nicholas settle, I am the chief of staff in the first ward office, and I am here to speak to recommend to the committee in favor of this zoning map amendment. The property is currently improved with a with a single unit residence, and it is a to the best of my knowledge, a legal non conforming dwelling because it is in manufacturing zoning.

So we are looking to bring the building into conformance with the zoning by with the zoning ordinance by converting it to a proper residential district, I would be happy to answer any questions that any committee members or the chairman has.

[Speaker 1] (1:15:31 - 1:15:47)
Okay, so the existing single family home in a M district right so it's non conforming. Is there a reason why at this point, and is there more than one house or is this just like a building permit issue or what to the best of my knowledge.

[Speaker 32] (1:15:48 - 1:16:17)
Yes, there's so there is some there there's been a whole host of redevelopment issues and adjacent condominium building. Allegedly there's there's some issues with repairs that need to be made due to some construction in the area and it is our understanding that the zoning was cited as a reason that that whatever repairs couldn't previously be made. So we are.

We are correcting that and bringing it into conformance with the zoning with the zoning ordinance.

[Speaker 47] (1:16:18 - 1:16:18)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (1:16:19 - 1:16:44)
That's a good, good explanation. Any questions from committee members. Hearing none.

Can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. So moved on the woman had makes the motion. Any objections to her motion.

Hearing on the item is passed. Thank you very much. We're moving on.

[Speaker 32] (1:16:44 - 1:16:45)
Thank you committee members.

I thank you so much Scott Boorstin here on behalf of learn charter school, right, that ring a bell.

[Speaker 6] (1:18:33 - 1:18:57)
I'm very familiar with this learning is a charter school of 83rd Street. Tom, they're building out the space to include some parking and some improvements to the building. There's been several meetings with the community, and we do support it and your most favorable consideration is appreciated.

And Mr Boorstin can go over the exact project in detail.

[Speaker 1] (1:18:57 - 1:19:10)
I don't think we need the detail if you're comfortable with because you are automatically introducing this so I am absolutely comfortable with this.

[Speaker 6] (1:19:10 - 1:19:29)
This is a great charter school is the benefit to the community. Learn is a is a is not a private school. It is a charter school.

So in the CPS network and and we'd ask that it be done automatically. Alrighty, any questions from committee members.

[Speaker 1] (1:19:30 - 1:19:53)
Hearing none, can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Some of them Riley makes the motion any objections to his motion. Carrying on the item is passed.

Thank you, Howard. We have that car wash later on, are you going to be back in back in the saddle, so to speak.

[Speaker 6] (1:19:53 - 1:19:56)

Common Address is 4401 through 4431 South Knox Avenue and the change request from m one to limited manufacturing district to RS to residential single unit detached house district all demand Mike Rodriguez, Michael.

[Speaker 22] (1:20:39 - 1:20:57)
Thank you chairman forgive me for not being able to put my video on, but this is certainly something we've worked with the community on have the local community based organization on on board with no opposition as of yet so thank you so much for bringing this forward and we ask our colleagues to pass favorably.

[Speaker 1] (1:20:58 - 1:21:04)
Michael is this is this a planning use. Future planning use on this one.

[Speaker 22] (1:21:06 - 1:21:20)
Chairman, the property in question sits on a residential block. Okay. And we're just bringing it into, into the preponderance of use on that block.

[Speaker 1] (1:21:20 - 1:21:24)
Okay. And it is a big, it is a vacant lot is it not Mike.

[Speaker 22] (1:21:25 - 1:21:25)
It is.

[Speaker 1] (1:21:25 - 1:21:39)
Okay. All right. Any other questions, comments.

If, if not, can I get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call those used to determine quorum. David Moore makes the motion. Any objections to his motion.

[Speaker 4] (1:21:40 - 1:21:55)
Hearing none, the item is passed. Okay, now we are for the, oh my gosh, we got all right.

[Speaker 1] (1:21:55 - 1:22:28)
So, as was talking to public comment period, the following items are in the 24th Ward. And I will read all the legal descriptions and the file number. We are going to hear from Brian O'Donnell from the Department of Housing to explain this initiative for members of the committee.

This is not the first time we've been doing this in the 24th Ward. My belief is this is in conjunction with Cook County housing. Help me here, staff.

[Speaker 5] (1:22:31 - 1:22:34)
Chicago initiative brought forth by the Department of Housing.

[Speaker 1] (1:22:34 - 1:27:58)
Okay, so Department of Housing is bringing forth the single family home initiative in the 24th Ward, and these are parcels I believe that are vacant. And we'll ask Mr. O'Donnell to elaborate a little bit further. But again, under Michael Scott's leadership we did this a number of months ago, and I believe we're, this is one of a series of initiatives in the 24th Ward.

All right. So with that said, work with me, staff, because we've got a fair amount of the next 16 items are part of reclaiming Chicago initiative brought forth by the Department of Housing. We hear from them together.

The items were introduced by Alderman Michael Scott on April 27 of 2022, and are now supported by all the woman, Monique Scott. I will read the items out. And after a presentation is made we'll take a motion on the items.

And these items are as follows. And just to reiterate, it was in the public comment period. There were two witnesses that hopefully are still on the call.

So, they were concerned about what actually was going to be built on these on these items which are their neighbors. So, file number, a 8754 for the common address 1219 South Kedzie Avenue change request be 33 community shopping district to be to one neighborhood mixed use district. I believe all these are going to be changed to be to one but let me keep reading file number a 8755 for the common address 1243 South Kedzie Avenue the change request for be three three community shopping district to be to one neighborhood mixed use district file number a 8756 common address 1251 South Kedzie Avenue, the change request from be three three community shopping district to be to one neighborhood mixed use district file number a 8757 common address 1255 South Kedzie Avenue and the change request again from be three three community shopping district to be to one neighborhood mixed use district found number a 8758 for the common address at 1601 South Sawyer Avenue, the change request from be free to community shopping district to be to one neighborhood mixed use district file number eight, a 8760 common address 2116 2118 South Albany Avenue, and the change request from m one to neighborhood manufacturing business park district to be to one neighborhood mixed use district file number a 8761 for the common address of 2130 South Albany Avenue, the change request from m one to neighborhood manufacturing business park district to be to one neighborhood mixed use district file number a 8762 common address is 1530 South Kedzie Avenue, and again the change request from a be free to community shopping district to be to one neighborhood mixed use district file number a 8763 common address is 1549 South Chicago Avenue, and the change request be free to community shopping district to be to one neighborhood mixed use district file number a 8765 with common address is 1951 South Troy Street, 2016 South Albany Avenue, the change request from see one to neighborhood commercial district to be to one neighborhood mixed use district file number a 8766 common address 1950 South Kedzie Avenue, the change request from a be free to community shopping district to be to one neighborhood mixed use district file number a 8767 common address 1933 through 1935 South Kedzie Avenue, and the change request from be free to community shopping district to be to one neighborhood mixed use district file number a 8768 common address is 1902 South Kedzie Avenue, and the change request from shopping district to be to one neighborhood mixed use district file number a 8769 common address is 1875 South Kedzie Avenue, and 3150 West 19th Street, the change request from be free to community shopping district to be to one neighborhood mixed use district file number a 8770 common address is 1908 South Kedzie Avenue, the change request from the be free to community shopping district to be to one neighborhood mixed use district.

And lastly file number eight, a 8771 for the common address 1957 South Kedzie Avenue, the change request again be free to community shopping district to be to one neighborhood mixed use district. And we have Brian O'Donnell as I said earlier here from the Department of Housing to explain this initiative in the 21st or 24th work.

[Speaker 4] (1:27:59 - 1:29:58)
All right, Brian. Good morning chairman before I proceed could be a person give me screen sharing capability. Can you try now please.

I, I got it. Thank you. So good, good morning Chairman Tony vice chairman for Boris, and committee members, for the record, my name is Brian O'Donnell testifying for the Homeownership Bureau in the Department of Housing.

The department supports the proposed zoning map amendments, and as detailed by the chair. If approved these amendments would allow for ground floor residential use. For the sake of ease and time I approved the lots by black for today's presentation.

The first batch of lots under consideration around the 1200 block of South Kedzie, as you can see on this zoning map. Lots have been owned by the city and bacon for 23 to 35 years. This is a bird's eye bird's eye view of the 1200 block of South Kedzie.

As you can see, both sides of this block are largely. The next batch of lots around the 1500 block of South. Sorry 1900 block of South Kedzie.

The lots have been owned by the city and bacon for 21 to 42 years. The birds I've used this block indicates predominantly residential uses, which in my deal means single family and, and two flats, sometimes a three plant thrown in 1601 South.

[Speaker 1] (1:29:58 - 1:30:07)
Hold on one second. So, mentioned that these lots as you proceed.

[Speaker 4] (1:30:08 - 1:30:18)
Our ground floor residential. So we're building single family homes and the B to one allows for ground floor residential to be three to does that.

[Speaker 1] (1:30:19 - 1:30:33)
I get that part, I get that part, but what I'm, what I'm saying is, will these be single family homes, yes, a bit of the neighbors is what I'm getting it. Okay, I just want that on the record.

[Speaker 4] (1:30:34 - 1:30:34)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (1:30:34 - 1:30:34)
Okay.

[Speaker 4] (1:30:35 - 1:34:10)
Thank you. And they'll see the type of home on the last slide. Continue with the restaurant.

Okay. The 1900 block of South Kedzie. Again, residential right by the Kedzie plant stuff 1601 South Sawyer, the corner on it is owned by the city and make it for 21 years.

It's truncated the block is truncated by Ogden Avenue, and it's predominantly residential uses, mostly. The last on the 2100 2100 block of South Albany currently have m one zoning, as you can see, the last have been owned by the city and vacant for 24 and 26 years. Serial shows that even though the zoning is m one.

The block is residential with the mix of single family homes, and two and three flats across the street is a larger VHA rental building. The two lots on the 1500 block of South Kedzie at B three to zoning and have been vacant and city owned for 26 and 29 years. The block is largely residential or mixed use those buildings being two or three stories.

There's a church on the east side of the block. These two labs, which are across an alley from each other when a toy when an Albany certainly have see one to zoning, and both have been vacant and city owned for 23 to 25 years. The east side of Troy is entirely residential, mostly two and three flats, although there is a small industrial property across the street in the 1951 property.

On the Albany side, again the west side of Albany is entirely residential. The single family and two and three flat property. As you can see both larger just south of the pink line track.

Sorry north of the, no I'm sorry south of the pink line track. The station will be a three minute walk. The last batch of larger at 1875 South Kedzie and 3150 West 19th Street.

The main parcel the Kedzie parcel has been city owned for 33 years, and the smaller parcel has been city owned since 1997. As as much of Lawndale this block is peppered with two flats with the mid, with the mid black church. The 3150 parcel will allow the home built at 1875 South Kedzie to have alley access.

As a reminder reclaiming Chicago is an effort to build up to 1000 new homes across the city. And the first effort to do this is taking place in the north and south Lawndale community areas. In ordinance to approve the sale of 100 that to the joint venture between Lawndale Christian Court Lawndale Christian Development Corp, or LCDC, the Chicago neighborhood initiatives, or CNI was approved by city council in October, 21.

That's under consideration today were included in the land sale ordinance. This concludes my presentation. Thank you, Brian.

[Speaker 1] (1:34:10 - 1:34:18)
So that's your prototype, obviously we as construction started on the first set of it all on the first set.

[Speaker 4] (1:34:18 - 1:34:47)
No, so this is a. The ordinance, there were two ordinances for this one was the land sale which I just mentioned the other was an infrastructure funding project ordinance. Because the lots are currently city owned and while the city owns a lot, we're going to be doing site excavation, water and sewer connection, building a foundation.

[Speaker 1] (1:34:47 - 1:34:53)
Yeah, the foundation part of it to get this. This, I think we talked about this the first batch.

[Speaker 39] (1:34:54 - 1:34:54)
Yeah.

[Speaker 1] (1:34:55 - 1:35:29)
All right. Alder woman Scott, are you on the call, would you like to speak on this please. Okay, wait a second.

So, all the, all the woman Scott, put a letter in is that we're saying, okay. Okay, all the woman dowel. So this is more for the department at this point, we do have a letter of support from all the woman Scott.

And of course we heard loud and strong, the Michael Scott when he was the ultimate on the first batch.

[Speaker 31] (1:35:29 - 1:35:30)
All right.

[Speaker 8] (1:35:31 - 1:35:45)
Chairman, I remember this when it came before us before excited about this project Brian I'd like to did I are you, did you say that the city is assuming the cost for water and excavation.

[Speaker 4] (1:35:46 - 1:35:46)
Yes.

[Speaker 8] (1:35:47 - 1:36:01)
Okay so for each home whether it's the traditional one or the modular one. The city is assuming that cost. What's the funding source for, for that.

[Speaker 4] (1:36:01 - 1:36:15)
When, when the cost is tip eligible, if we'll be funding it. There are two different tips, the Midwest and the item Alaska. And then recovery grant money will be the other.

[Speaker 8] (1:36:15 - 1:36:29)
And how much for those three items. What's the typical or the average cost per home, that the city would be additional subsidy besides the land costs.

[Speaker 4] (1:36:29 - 1:36:35)
So for us that don't need remediation, we're going to be between at and $100,000.

[Speaker 8] (1:36:36 - 1:36:42)
So at and $100,000 for no remediation and for houses that require remediation.

[Speaker 4] (1:36:42 - 1:36:55)
That's going to depend on the extent of remediation, and we're still working through that with a is. So the first thoughts that we're going to be doing this on will be lots that do not need remediation.

[Speaker 8] (1:36:55 - 1:37:03)
All right, but the remediation costs would be assumed by the developer by the city, so that that's an entire that's a tip.

[Speaker 4] (1:37:04 - 1:37:10)
Cost. By the city. The city is paying for everything.

There is no developer.

[Speaker 8] (1:37:11 - 1:37:19)
Okay, and what's the cost to the homeowner what's the average price for these homes. So, additional and the module.

[Speaker 4] (1:37:19 - 1:37:23)
Both of them are targeted to sell it about $250,000.

[Speaker 47] (1:37:28 - 1:37:28)
Okay.

[Speaker 8] (1:37:29 - 1:37:31)
Thank you, Mr. Chair.

[Speaker 4] (1:37:32 - 1:37:33)
Thank you all the woman.

[Speaker 1] (1:37:34 - 1:37:42)
So, again, for the record who's the city is putting the foundations in water sewer etc. The.

[Speaker 4] (1:37:44 - 1:37:51)
This is a joint venture tell us the partners I'm sorry. It's London Christian Development Corp. Chicago neighborhood initiatives.

[Speaker 1] (1:37:55 - 1:38:08)
And what is, what is their role. If they don't have a financial role. Is it just to screen and get the app, get the neighborhood excited about it and get them.

[Speaker 4] (1:38:09 - 1:38:24)
Alderman Tony I misunderstood your question. So, in terms of building the houses, the parties I just mentioned are the two responsible party. In terms of doing the infrastructure work in the site prep etc that's going to be Chicago neighborhood initiatives.

[Speaker 1] (1:38:28 - 1:38:30)
Say it again Brian I'm sorry.

[Speaker 4] (1:38:30 - 1:38:58)
So, and so once we complete the work, and everything is signed up by the building department, we will sell the last to the joint entity of London Christian and CNI for $1 and they will proceed to build a house. In terms of doing the actual site prep and excavation water sewer foundation. That's a project it's see Chicago neighborhood initiatives is working on with the city.

[Speaker 1] (1:39:02 - 1:39:14)
Okay, your, your testimony basically said the cost of water sewer foundation is a city cost. Correct.

[Speaker 4] (1:39:15 - 1:39:22)
But what so neighborhood Chicago neighborhood initiatives will be our contractor. Okay. Okay.

[Speaker 8] (1:39:23 - 1:39:25)
All right. All right.

[Speaker 1] (1:39:26 - 1:39:28)
All the woman down like your hand is up again.

[Speaker 8] (1:39:28 - 1:39:38)
Yeah, just one other question. I'm just curious. This is the zoning question.

Why are we doing B2 dash one instead of a residential zone.

[Speaker 4] (1:39:38 - 1:39:54)
Because most of the areas are zone that we're addressing our zone B32, and so they wanted it I think so anyone that's probably Patrick and enter that better but it's to keep it as close as possible to what's current, what the adjacent lots.

[Speaker 8] (1:39:55 - 1:40:52)
Okay. Um, you know, I'm very excited about this project because I think this will be the first community, where we can actually demonstrate that we can bring a home to market. That's under $350,000 or $350,000, I need to have that kind of housing in my ward and I know I'm talking to Brian S and Berg about this now, but I'm really excited about this to see how these homes are received, how they fit into the context of the Lawndale community North Lawndale community which mirrors, many of which mirrors Brownsville's housing stock in many cases.

So, congratulations to all of us that moving this forward. Looking forward to seeing it come out the ground. Thank you, Mr. Chair.

[Speaker 1] (1:40:53 - 1:40:54)
Thank you all been Burnett.

[Speaker 26] (1:40:56 - 1:41:19)
Thank you, Mr Chairman. Also commend this project I think is great and excited about it when I first saw it. Happy that Alderman Scott can can carry the baton and keep moving.

Brian who so are these clinics. Marginal homes.

[Speaker 4] (1:41:19 - 1:41:23)
Yes. And the traditional will be built by breaking ground.

[Speaker 26] (1:41:25 - 1:42:08)
Breaking ground. Okay. Yeah, so it's interesting.

So, so, Brian, I don't know, and maybe this is a broader question for the administration and and CHA, and, you know, housing and planning. Maybe CHA need to look at some of these things to, you know, we get properties that has been vacant for, you know, going almost 30 years now. And we need housing to be replaced.

And then, so they maybe they need to look at that too just a thought. All right. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:42:09 - 1:42:21)
Thank you Alderman. So, Brian, what kind of conversations you had with CHA in regards to this novel development.

[Speaker 4] (1:42:22 - 1:42:40)
Alderman Tunney none, but I wouldn't anyway I, it's not any part of my portfolio I handle single family development and I'm trying to get the contract with CNI done and other projects done and so that kind of work is that above my head.

[Speaker 1] (1:42:40 - 1:43:02)
Okay. Well again it's probably for the administration, you know we don't live in silos, you know, we've got a housing crisis so I just think communication is the key. So, but on this issue.

I don't see any other hands up. Okay. Can I get them.

I'm going to read. Do I need to read all these decades. Okay.

[Speaker 4] (1:43:03 - 1:43:06)
Okay. Sherman so someone just raised their hand.

[Speaker 1] (1:43:07 - 1:43:12)
I'm sorry. Anna. Chairman.

Yes.

[Speaker 5] (1:43:12 - 1:43:29)
I just want to confirm. File number 88764 and 1554 Patsy 1559 South Patsy that deferred or was that on the list that individual item has been deferred. Okay, great.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:43:29 - 1:45:21)
Okay. All right. So let me, let me get a motion moved to pass by the same role because you determine quorum on the following file numbers.

They're all a is an aldermanic. We'll start with 8754 8755 8756 8757 8758 8760 8761 8762 8763 8765 8766 8767 8768 8769 8770. And 8771.

Thank you chairman. As you mentioned, this address is a parcel immediately north of a hotel or you've had ongoing disciplinary issues we had a shooting on this property. drug use other legal activities.

And, as such, the neighbors in this immediate neighborhood are very concerned about the addition of more hotel use to the block, as such, we did work with Sander hotels which was interested in the property. We had them meet with various neighboring properties and residents. My office also facilitated other conversations with neighbors, and it became abundantly clear, there was a resounding no to adding more hotel units to this block and so as such for land use planning.

And as per the two letters I sent to your committee staff on rational basis. I'm asking my committee colleagues to support the amendment. Thank you.

Thank you, Brendan.

[Speaker 1] (1:46:30 - 1:47:07)
First of all, this item was heard in the plan commission. So, Alderman Waguesback moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections.

Okay, so the records are incorporated to the committee, and I was on plan commission as Alderman Waguesback so for the benefit of what Brendan is saying that this is a change of use within the plan development to not allow any future hotel use. Moving forward. In this plan development.

[Speaker 41] (1:47:07 - 1:47:14)
Is that correct, Brendan. I think it is correct that that is correct chairman. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:47:14 - 1:48:02)
Alrighty. Any questions, comments. Hearing none.

Can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Move to pass German Alderman Waguesback makes the motion any objections to the motion. Hearing on this item is passed as revised.

All right, thank you Chairman, you are on page five document number 21098 in the sixth board ordinance was referred on July 20 of 2022, the common address is 650 East 77th Street, and the change request from an RS three residential single unit detached house district to an RM 4.5 residential multi unit district. And we have all see Tom Moore is the attorney on this.

So this is a gentleman who lives in the neighborhood, and who. Here we go. Now I'm here.

[Speaker 34] (1:48:44 - 1:49:31)
There you are, sir. How are you today. Very well thank you very much.

So this is a gentleman who lives in the neighborhood who bought this four flat five, he thought it was a five flat at the end of the block. He only found out later when he had a disgruntled tenant that the city's records only showed it as a four flat. He'd like he wants to legitimize and make compliant.

The basement unit. He has hired an architect, and his plans. And we have the support of Alderman Sawyer, and we respectfully request your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (1:49:33 - 1:49:39)
You're correct we do have a letter of support from Alderman Sawyer. I don't know. Right.

That completes our testimony this morning, we respectfully request your approval of the matter and the team is available to answer any questions. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:00:51 - 2:00:57)
Thank you, Carol. Alderman King, do you want to comment on this exciting development.

[Speaker 16] (2:00:58 - 2:01:50)
Yeah, thank you chair I appreciate it. So I'm, I'm happy about the Northwesterns Bronzeville advanced healthcare facility, coming into the community, as was mentioned they've had numerous amount of community meetings and adapted and listen to what the community said they wanted. And I'm also happy that they have a robust commitment to diversity in their over $100 million budget with an African American prime on here, and also commitment to hiring diverse subcontractors.

So, I wholeheartedly support this and would ask my colleagues for their favorable support as well.

[Speaker 1] (2:01:50 - 2:02:12)
Thank you all the woman. I just have one question. Obviously I saw this a plan commission, Carol.

You know we know that some of these hospital floors are higher but how did it get to 102 feet. Just five floors that sounds like an average of 2020 feet of floor.

[Speaker 5] (2:02:12 - 2:02:37)
As Paul Brian from Lamar Johnson who's on our call today the project architect to maybe answer that question about, you know, the floor levels and how five stories got to 102, I think that also includes, I would say before Paul jumps on. I think it includes some of that mechanical space that's enclosed on top that you can see, but I'm going to let Paul speak to that specifically. How are you on the call with me.

[Speaker 27] (2:02:37 - 2:02:53)
I am yes thank you Mr Chairman Thank you Carol yes that Carol that is correct. The building height of 102 feet is driven, essentially by the mechanical penthouse up on the up on the roof level and the over the elevator overrun associated with getting to that level.

[Speaker 1] (2:02:53 - 2:03:08)
And the department has verified that that that adds to the height I get the reality. But oftentimes, the mechanicals are not part of the legal zoning height.

[Speaker 5] (2:03:09 - 2:03:42)
That's correct. And I think that when we when we think about improvements, mechanicals, etc that are located on the roof, if it's enclosed, and it is an excess of 6.6 feet nine inches it is considered a floor. So, based on our discussions with the department, 102 is the max of the, of the building height.

Now the under, if I don't have a apologies, I don't have a, it's more technical in nature Carol I think so. Yeah.

[Speaker 1] (2:03:43 - 2:04:51)
Yeah. And of course it's obviously has been vetted and supported by the older woman in their community so it's obviously an amazing resource so congratulations. Any other questions, comments from committee members.

If not, can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. So move Chairman, Alderman Wagesback makes the motion, any objections to the motion. Hearing none this item is passed as revised.

And we are going to stay in the fourth ward. Thank you, Carol. All right.

Topic eight seven document number 21085 fourth ward ordinance was referred on July 20 of 2022. And this change request is a plan development change and amendment number 815 to 815 as amended. And we have Katrina McGuire on this item.

Katrina.

[Speaker 43] (2:04:51 - 2:05:12)
Good afternoon, Mr Chairman members of the committee Katrina McGuire from Thompson Coburn here. It's my pleasure to be here on behalf of Family Roots LLC, Matthew Brewer of Family Roots is joining me this morning. This is a matter that went to plan commission on September 15, and accordingly we would ask that the record of the plan commission proceedings be incorporated here in.

[Speaker 1] (2:05:13 - 2:05:26)
So Alderman Cardona moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections. Hearing none the records are incorporated and proceed.

[Speaker 43] (2:05:27 - 2:06:14)
Thank you. So the purpose of this amendment was actually very simple it was simply to amend the use list within sub area B of the PD 815. In order to allow the applicant to move forward to the zoning board of appeals for an application for special use for for a cannabis dispensary.

The cannabis dispensary is not being approved as part of this amendment. Again, as I noted is simply to allow us to advance to the zoning board of appeals for that approval to engage in further community meetings as required by the zoning board of appeals rules. As well as provide notice of those meetings as well as hearings as required.

And with that, we have no further presentation but again, my client Matt Brewer is on as well if there's any questions.

[Speaker 1] (2:06:14 - 2:06:22)
All right. Questions by committee members. If not all the woman King on this item, please.

[Speaker 16] (2:06:22 - 2:08:11)
Yeah, thank you, Chair. This, as you know is dispensary that would like to locate in the ward we had detailed meeting with the public. Before this zoning application was submitted, and the applicant came in freely and heard you know feedback from the residents.

Most of the negative feedback was about issues that we already have on Wabash and Roosevelt Road. Also, you know there's kind of a fear of the negative impacts of dispensaries, which we know have been unfounded. You know, I also said, you know, during the planning commission that, you know, I also, you know, had some similar fears, but have visited dispensary in the West Loop and have, you know, kept up with how dispensaries are doing and, you know, they're very regulated and secure.

With that in mind, you know, and also the fact that this is a social equity applicant, and we know that they've been waiting years to start dispensaries in the city we can have a whole nother meeting on why but I think they deserve to be in high traffic areas as well. To that end, the applicant has said, you know, he will engage in other community meetings. And for these reasons, I'm in support of this project moving forward, and would also love to have your favorable, the committee's favorable decision on this as well.

[Speaker 1] (2:08:13 - 2:08:16)
Thank you Alderman. Alderman Mike Rodriguez has his hand up.

[Speaker 22] (2:08:17 - 2:08:35)
Yeah, I just wanted to congratulate Alderman King on a, you know, real wise look at this issue and, you know, sometimes it's nuanced and it seems like you've dotted your eyes and crossed your T so kudos, and just wanted to move to pass Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:08:36 - 2:09:03)
Thank you. Any other questions I have just have one comment just so. I think there was a caller, all the woman King.

That was in opposition to this. I understand the community process portion of it but this is where the potbelly, this is where was the yeah there's currently have a picture. We don't have it does does Katrina have a picture of the building I know it was that plan commission.

[Speaker 16] (2:09:03 - 2:09:56)
Yeah, it's, it's right on Roosevelt Road just a little west of Michigan. You know, in the potbelly location across from an Amoco once one story building right so one story. Yeah, well it's, it's a two story building, it may even be three actually but Trader Joe's is near there in the same building potbellies.

You know, really, the red line is, you know, right next door across Wabash just west of Wabash so it's a very vibrant area. And, you know, we have had some concerns over there, new commander seems to be handling those, but they have nothing to do with the dispensary.

[Speaker 1] (2:09:56 - 2:10:04)
And so, right, as one who has a dispensary the burner security is somewhat reassuring to the neighbors.

[Speaker 4] (2:10:04 - 2:10:06)
So, all right.

[Speaker 1] (2:10:06 - 2:10:37)
And again, just as we all know, this is the first step, zoning Board of Appeals, and then obviously at the end of the day, the state has their final say on this but this is part of the process so appreciate your leadership on the issue. And we have Mike Rodriguez, with the motion who passed by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to his motion.

Hearing none this item is passed as revised. All right.

[Speaker 47] (2:10:37 - 2:10:37)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:10:38 - 2:11:16)
Thank you. All right. Middle of page six document number 21107 in the sixth ward ordinance was referred on July 20 of 2022 and the common address to 6930 through 6962 South Vincennes Avenue, and also 100 through 108 West 70th Street.

And we have the change request from an RT for residential two flat townhouse and multi unit district to be one free neighborhood shopping district. Scott Borenstein on this item in six.

[Speaker 33] (2:11:16 - 2:12:37)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman members of the committee Scott Borenstein from the law offices of Neil and Roy here on behalf of POA preservation for affordable housing. This is really a technical amendment. There's no change to the building.

No changes to the use. Other than we do have a new ground floor commercial tenant. That's going to be expanding, and so we did some research to try to determine whether this was a pre existing legal use because there have been some commercial users on the ground floor it's it's the office management company, but it didn't date back far enough to get us into the legal non conforming status so the only way to correct it was to change the zoning.

And then when we did that we thought okay we would just clean it up and get it as close in terms of FAR and number of units, and so forth. Under the proposed zoning so that that's what we're doing here there's no change. You know POA is going to continue to own the building, and there will just be a new office management company on the ground floor.

You should have a letter of support from Alderman Sawyer but I see that he was here before I'm not sure if he's still here if he wants to hear Scott.

[Speaker 9] (2:12:37 - 2:12:39)
Good afternoon. All right.

[Speaker 1] (2:12:39 - 2:12:42)
Alderman Sawyer on this item on Vincent's.

[Speaker 32] (2:12:43 - 2:12:49)
Thank you, Chairman and good afternoon to everyone again yeah we are very aware of the prior uses of the building.

[Speaker 10] (2:12:50 - 2:12:57)
We're around the building quite often and we support the, the technical change, and I hope that I can get favorable consideration.

[Speaker 1] (2:12:57 - 2:13:19)

[Speaker 42] (2:13:47 - 2:14:57)
Thank you, Mr Chairman. My name is Mark I'm an attorney with offices at 77 West Washington. I represent the applicant.

This is for the property 3100 North LeClaire Avenue. The applicant LLC the sole member of the LLC is Tony Santiago. Tony bought this building a while back as a six flat with two basement apartments.

More recently a city inspector question the permit history of the basement units, and we were not able to find any, any permit history for those basement apartments. Tony hired an architect to apply for a permit was advised that he would need to change the zoning change in order to keep those two basement units. Please know we're 31 3100 North, but a block off Belmont Avenue, and I believe under that new changes to the zoning ordinance I believe that Belmont at this stretch is a TSL bus corridor now, so perhaps a good spot to add some additional units.

We did speak to all the members about this application, and I mentioned that he's going to be on the call so I would defer to him.

[Speaker 1] (2:14:58 - 2:15:01)

[Speaker 12] (2:19:55 - 2:21:24)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, my apologies because it appears that my camera doesn't seem to be. I don't have the function to turn it on, but don't want to delay you. Oh, hold on there I was upgraded again to a panelist.

Good afternoon again, Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant. The property before you is at the southwest corner of 26th Street and Hamlin. It is currently improved with a three story building that has been vacant for a very long time, more than a decade probably more than two decades.

The ground floor of the building is to be rehabilitated for restaurant carnitas, which is a Chicago favorite. And then the proposed rezoning is to allow the upper two floors which are vacant to be converted to residential use with a dwelling units on those floors for per floor parking for the property will be provided an existing lot. That is owned by the applicant, that is approximately about a 50 feet north of the property on Hamlin.

We have met with the alderman, I believe he is supportive in the community is supportive of this proposed rezoning because it will bring this building back into productive use and provide housing in the area. With that, Mr. Chairman, I am happy to answer any questions you may have.

[Speaker 1] (2:21:24 - 2:21:28)
Okay, this item is in the 22nd ward alderman Mike Rodriguez.

[Speaker 22] (2:21:29 - 2:22:56)
Thank you, Mr. Chair. This is a great project. So excited about this.

Our community is very excited about this. The historic 26th Street. The second magnificent mile has had an eyesore for the better part of two decades, and the building.

While not formally historic certainly historic in the minds of the residents and those who have come to Little Village for over the years as one of the most iconic buildings in our ward, and we are finally getting a badly needed facelift here. This is a Latino owned restaurant longtime restaurant from Pilsen expanding into Little Village, and everything they've proposed here has been passed through my advisory council block club meeting block club folks and with great enthusiasm the neighborhood is supportive of this effort, not only are we bringing another famed restaurant to the community. But we were, we are also creating a housing density with more apartments here, and relieving some of our parking issues on in the ward hopefully through this effort as well.

Can't say enough about this project, those moving it forward. We are 100% in support, and I urge my colleagues to be as supportive as well.

[Speaker 1] (2:22:56 - 2:23:06)
Thank you, Mr. Thank you, Mike sounds like an exciting project especially the building has been vacant for a number of years right.

[Speaker 22] (2:23:07 - 2:23:20)
Oh yeah, it's been vacant for a long time, and, you know, it's got some peculiars to it very high ceilings on the second and third floor which are creatively being adapted for this project so really really excited.

[Speaker 1] (2:23:20 - 2:24:09)
All right. Questions, comments, many members hearing on can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. So moved on the woman had makes the motion and the objections to her motion.

Great. Good effort. Good morning.

Good afternoon, Chairman Tony and members of the committee. My name is Lenny sorrow. I'm a partner at the law firm of bakery drinker fiddle and read.

We represent the applicant healthy Brighton members of the committee on August 18 2022, the Planning Commission voted to recommend approval of this plan development application.

[Speaker 4] (2:25:25 - 2:25:45)
Pursuant to that I would request that this committee incorporate into the records on the records that were presented and incorporated at the Planning Commission. Okay, so when we get into the presentation here. The common addresses here.

[Speaker 1] (2:25:45 - 2:26:17)
Help me here. We've got 2833 West 47th Street. And then we have to see me overlapping 2749 to 57 West 47th Street.

Is that a, is that some kind of typo or what am I doing, it's a, it's a, it's a typo. So we should be for the presentation. It should be just 2749 through 57 West 47th Street.

[Speaker 18] (2:26:18 - 2:26:47)
Actually, no chairman, it is, so it's it's one parcel that has two lots, and that is so that's at the corner, the south east corner of California and 47 so that address, I believe should be 27. 55 through 57, and then we skip over two lots, going towards the east, and that address should be 2749 dash 2745.

[Speaker 1] (2:26:47 - 2:27:23)
Okay, so let me read that in, let me read that again. If I'm correct in saying that the common address is 2833 West 47th Street 2755 to 2757 and 2749 through 2745 on West 47th Street. And then of course 4717 through 4723 South California.

Okay, just another, another typo but that's okay. Just so we have it straight for the record. Thanks.

Thank you Chairman apologize for that typo. Members of the committee Esperanza health centers is planning a significant expansion of health care services at its flagship location Esperanza Brighton Park, which is known as BP one. It's located at 4700 South California Avenue, which is at the southwest corner of 47th and California Esperanza plans to construct a separate second building BP to immediately south of and adjacent to BP one.

Both buildings will be located on the same zoning lot. The slide that you see there is a slide of the prior slide is a slide of the existing building BP one, and then on the bottom right is a picture of the proposed location for BP to which is immediately south of BP one.

BP to will provide more needed health care and social services to Chicago southwest side, the 43,000 square foot annex will offer expanded medical and behavioral health services comprehensive senior programming, a family medicine residency program with Rush University Medical Center to train the next generation of community based physicians, multiple indoor and outdoor spaces for health, learning and recreation, a community super lobby full service cafe, a public plaza, and a link pedestrian pathway between BP one and BP to that will provide safety for pedestrians and a quarter mile walking track that encourages movement and physical activity.

So your most favorable consideration on this matter is greatly appreciated.

[Speaker 11] (2:38:48 - 2:38:49)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (2:38:49 - 2:38:56)
Hold on, hold on, before we go, we got the records incorporated but Alderman David Moore has his hand up.

[Speaker 14] (2:38:59 - 2:39:05)
We got the overall project I let him finish and then you can call on me. Okay, we'll do the present.

[Speaker 1] (2:39:05 - 2:39:09)
We'll, we'll do the presentation and go back to Alderman David Moore is that right, David.

[Speaker 14] (2:39:10 - 2:39:11)
That's correct.

[Speaker 1] (2:39:11 - 2:39:13)
Okay, Chris continue please.

[Speaker 11] (2:39:14 - 2:39:53)
Thank you very much. PD 966 was initially approved in September 29, 2004, and encompasses the entire Chatham Market shopping center, consisting of approximately 42 acres. The proposed amendment before you today is to add the permitted use of a car wash and cleaning services to outlaw be to allow outlet outlaw be to be improved with a one story car wash building 4775 feet in size with 26 on site parking spaces, access to the site will be from the existing driveway on 83rd Street, and from access drives within the Chatham Market shopping center.

[Speaker 1] (2:39:53 - 2:40:17)
Hold on, hold on, hold on. We've got an aerial but where is. Can we can someone point out where this.

Yeah, the subject site is okay, but what is it, what is it, I see planet fitness, and what is it on the, on the know lows I see but immediately I on 83rd Street.

[Speaker 11] (2:40:18 - 2:40:25)
Is that a, is that a vacant lot or. This is the that's making a lot in the subject site is also a vacant lot.

[Speaker 1] (2:40:26 - 2:40:32)
Okay, just want to put it in a perspective because we have a lot we had a lot of comment on this.

[Speaker 11] (2:40:32 - 2:40:42)
I appreciate that. Yes, it looks like although it's shaded, it is, it looks just like the one to the right there it's a vacant lot, it's a grass, vacant lot right now.

[Speaker 12] (2:40:42 - 2:40:42)
Okay.

[Speaker 11] (2:40:42 - 2:42:18)
And the proposed development is that it does not add any new curb cuts to 83rd Street, the car wash facility will be extensively landscaped grass parkways surrounding the site, and with 31 new trees added to the four existing trees and new shrubs and along 83rd Street. The facility has, like I mentioned before 26 on site parking spaces and three lanes of stacking area to accommodate all customer vehicles on site. The proposed amendment does not make any other changes to PD 966, the economic and community benefits of the proposed amendment include a $5 million investment in the Chatham community area.

The activation of a vacant unimproved out lot within PD 966 fronting on 83rd Street, your creation of approximately 100 construction jobs, the creation of approximately eight permanent jobs, and a commitment to the MBE WBE city residency participation goals of 26% 6% and 50%. The applicant has received a letter of support from Alderman Brookins, and has participated in a community meeting posted by Alderman Brookins as well. On behalf of the applicant, I would like to thank Alderman Brookins, and his staff, and the staff of DPD for their work on this project, particularly, Patrick Brutus, I stand ready to answer any questions that you may have, and ask for your favorable recommendation.

Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (2:42:19 - 2:42:26)
All right, Chris. I see Alderman Moore's hand up, please, David.

[Speaker 14] (2:42:26 - 2:43:58)
Yes, thank you. Always, unless it's something that fully impacts me, or my constituents, I always defer to the Alderman, who, in most cases, our Alderman try to do their due diligence to work with the community and I'm not, I have no doubt that Howard Brookins, head of community meeting. Unfortunately, on my end, at a West Chatham meeting, which is a very vocal voice in the community.

If it was one person, I can see but there was some concerns by last meeting I was in, had to have about 50 to 60 members there had some concerns and I don't, I don't know if the chairman want to speak on that, or how we could possibly. If you would consider holding it or having some discussion with the West Chatham community group to see how they can get on board, it'd be very important for me that they are on board, given that's one of the strongest voices in the West Chatham area. And so I don't know if Chairman Brook is want to speak to that, but I want to support it with their support but at right now their support isn't there.

And I want to if our Brook is before I take a position on this. If you can comment on that. Hold on, hold on a second.

[Speaker 1] (2:44:02 - 2:44:09)
Howard, it's obviously your ward. Would you, can you comment on Alderman David Moore's concern.

[Speaker 6] (2:44:10 - 2:49:16)
Absolutely. So I assume that he's talking about a meeting that just happened recently, which I've been told from my sources I was purposely not invited to come because they knew my stand. We've had several meetings regarding this Alderman Moore, but specifically I talked to Ms. Turner and other people four years ago, regarding this. I held this, this property four years ago, because they had some concerns. If you listen to what Ms. Turner said this morning and Ms. Baldwin who was also president of that organization at one time, they said that they objected for two reasons. The first reason was they just didn't want a car wash, period, end of story.

And it's nothing that I'm going to be able to do to convince them with respect to a car wash. The second reason that Ms. Baldwin stated was that she was concerned about some flooding with respect to the area. With respect to, let me take the easiest one, with respect to flooding.

One, these are modern car washes. They use little to no water. They reclaim the water.

But more importantly, when it's raining, people don't get car washes. So there is no adding to the sewer system that would overtax any system because nobody is going to get a car wash while it is actively raining outside. With respect to the second, the main complaint of the residents in West Chatham is we just don't want a car wash.

Why don't you try to get something else? This property was vacant for more than or approximately 40 years. When we first decided to develop this with the Walmart and Lowe's, you know the history as to how long it took to get those stores and retailers open.

I have worked tirelessly every day for nearly 20 years to get this mall filled with anybody that I could get in there that made sense to the community. A car wash, so after four years and we have lobbied a variety of businesses to come, we are not able to get anybody who wanted to invest their money with respect to the subject site here despite all of our efforts and going back and forth. I cannot, I don't pick winners and losers and if the main reason is we don't want a car wash because there's a car wash on 79th and Vincennes and there's a car wash on 75th and State Street and there's a car wash on 83rd Street.

I also would point out that there's a McDonald's on 87th near State Street, there's a Burger King across the street, there's a Wendy's on Lafayette, but you kind of get what I'm saying. I don't pick those winners and losers. When people want to invest their money in a community and particularly with respect to Buddy Bear who does a yeoman's job of one, making sure that his facility is clean, making sure that people are not hanging out at the particular location, then they are welcome with respect to our community.

We still also have a significantly larger parcel of property which is approximately three acres to the immediate east that we've been having a difficult time trying to get some business to develop that area. So I hear you with respect to the meetings, they just don't like the answer and it is unfortunate that if those are the two reasons why you're opposing these developments, they don't make logical sense nor hold up with respect to the reality of this particular site. Last but not least, business begets business.

These businesses in this mall are in a fragile state. As you know, Alderman Moore, Walmart almost did not open back up after the store was significantly damaged and burned down. The numbers for the sales in the store are not great.

We do need to drive traffic to these particular retailers for them to be successful or else we will be another ghost mall with businesses leaving. So I implore my colleagues on this committee to defer to my judgment with respect to this and trying to get businesses in my community and as I say, you heard it from them. The two reasons they gave you were one, we don't want flooding and two, we just don't want a car wash.

[Speaker 14] (2:49:19 - 2:49:20)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:49:21 - 2:49:24)
Spoken like a veteran Alderman.

[Speaker 14] (2:49:26 - 2:49:27)
Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:49:27 - 2:49:44)
All right, David, anything else in comment to that, or other questions, comments from committee members. All right, hearing no more questions or comments going to get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

[Speaker 36] (2:49:49 - 2:49:51)
So moved Chairman Alderman Wagesbeck.

[Speaker 1] (2:49:51 - 2:49:56)
Alderman Wagesbeck makes the motion to move to pass. Any objections to the motion.

[Speaker 36] (2:49:59 - 2:49:59)
Hearing none.

[Speaker 1] (2:49:59 - 2:50:03)
This item is passed as revised. Thank you everybody. Thank you.

[Speaker 47] (2:50:03 - 2:50:05)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (2:50:07 - 2:50:34)
Back to the bottom of page 10. Document number 21101 t one in the 27th Ward, or this was referred on July 20 of 2022 common address 2654 West Adam Street, and the change request from M one to limited manufacturing business park district to an RT for residential two flat townhouse and multi unit district. And we have Miss Sarah Barnes.

Sarah.

[Speaker 2] (2:50:34 - 2:53:09)
Thank you. Good afternoon, Mr Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Sarah Barnes, and I'm an attorney with the losses of the bank.

Please forgive me I'm so a little good news for you Mr Chairman I'm still a little under the weather from last week. And so my voice might come and go I'm going to do my best to get through the next couple cases and be as brief as possible. And if you guys lose me at any point.

Just nudge me. Yeah, boy. Um, I'm super happy to be here this afternoon on behalf of the applicant Judah investments LLC and MKB business strategies, LLC.

This proposal is actually quite similar to the amazing efforts that we saw in the 24th Ward earlier, but at an individual scale. The subject property is currently part of a packet of properties on West Adam Street that still has an underlying zoning classification of manufacturing, and even though most of the improved last in that area are residential. My client, the current property owners actually purchased this property from the city.

About a year ago, with the intention of building affordable housing over affordable single family homes in this part of the ward. So towards that and the proposal does call for the permitting of a new two story single family residence on that will have off street parking for two vehicles. Again, the intention is to make this home available at a very affordable rate to people in need within the 27th Ward towards that and the applicant has engaged ongoingly with the Garfield Park Community Council towards these efforts.

Over the last year and now community meeting was also had related to this proposal, I'm happy to advise that we do have the support of the Garfield Park Community Council, and we to have engaged with alderman Burnett in this respect and I believe he might still be in the meeting and can make further comments towards these.

[Speaker 1] (2:53:09 - 2:53:22)
All right, let's hear from alderman Burnett and you said brief so we got a couple to get through so you know, for your voice and for our ears. Let's hear from alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 26] (2:53:22 - 2:54:41)
All right, thank you, Mr. Chairman, as a counselor said, we did have a community meeting in regards to this development and several other developments. This is one of the city is it is a city lots of working families that they're engaged with where they have to do a certain percentage affordable and a certain percentage market rate. Working with the Department of Housing, they bidded on several pieces of property, this developer, one of the development partners is a guy by the name of Melvin Bailey, who's actually a young man who pulled hisself up out of bootstraps.

He used to march on construction sites now he's doing construction, and he's motivating and encouraging so many other people who are doing negative things to do positive things. So this community is wrapping their arms around him. This would be his second or third development, working with Mr Judah, and we look forward to seeing them build some affordable housing in this area, and the community supports it, I support it.

And I know the Department of Housing, which is working with them on these lots supported also. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:54:42 - 2:55:42)
Thank you Alderman Burnett questions for the Alderman or the applicant. Hearing none. Can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Some of the chairman Alderman August back makes the motion any objections to his motion. Hearing none, the item is passed. All right.

Page 11 top of page 11 document number 20814 in the second ward ordinance was referred on September 14 of 21 address 2258 to 2276 North Clyburn, and the change request institutional business plan development number 1189 and M one to limited manufacturing business park district, all to a seat to to motor vehicle related commercial district, and then to institutional business plan development 1189 as amended. All right, Sarah Barnes.

[Speaker 2] (2:55:42 - 2:56:44)
Thank you. Once more Mr Chairman and members of the committee for the record my name is Sarah Barnes and I'm an attorney with the lobsters and CMV. And here this afternoon on behalf of the applicant, the Salvation Army, who owns the subject property, and has been operating their flagship family thrift store and a no fee adult rehabilitation center at the subject property, since 2012.

That was part of the original plan development, which we are here today seeking to amend towards that end Mr Chairman, and for your recollection. We did a present this proposal and application to the Chicago Plan Commission at their public meeting on July 21 2022, wherein it received unanimous approval, I would therefore please seek to have the record of those proceedings adapted into the record here today.

[Speaker 1] (2:56:45 - 2:56:55)
Great the records from the Plan Commission by the same role for those who determine form. Any objections. Carrying on the records are incorporated if you would continue please.

[Speaker 2] (2:56:55 - 2:58:47)
Sure. And the reason we are here today is the original plan development from 2012 did omit a couple of adjacent parcels that have frontage on five or an avenue, which were under private ownership at the time so there's kind of a notch in the boundary of the plan development Salvation Army Army recently had an opportunity to acquire one of those sites, which it did with the intent to expand their off street parking accommodations to service, the existing rehabilitation facility as well as their family thrift store.

So it's not super exciting but we are just adding. Currently there's 145 parking spaces that service. These existing uses and we're adding 15, which includes some ADA compliant and accessible parking spaces on beyond the new surface parking lot there will be no expansion to the physicality of the existing improvements or their uses.

This is only to permit the additional 15 parking spaces. With that we worked actually for quite a while with Alderman Hopkins, as well as with the city's Department of Transportation to ensure that the addition of these 15 parking spaces would not have any sort of adverse impact on the adjacent community because it is near a pretty busy intersection. We do have the support of all of the internal divisions within the Department of Planning and Development, as well as the support of Alderman Hopkins, who has issued a letter of support memorializing and acknowledging his consent to this amendment.

So with no further ado, I do respectfully request that the committee's approval of this amendment to the plan development.

[Speaker 1] (2:58:49 - 2:59:05)
Thank you, Sarah. This went through plan commission with Alderman Hopkins support. I don't think all the minutes on the call.

Oh, is he Oh, Brian. You want to comment on on the Clyburn lot please.

[Speaker 40] (2:59:06 - 3:00:15)
Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just to add to what Council for the applicant said we did go through an extensive review process with CEDAW traffic engineers just to try and maximize the efficiency for this lot it's important we do that because this is not just a thrift store and a rehab facility. It's also a drive through donation center.

So a significant amount of the traffic generated at this lot is people just driving into donate supplies, and they want to get in off Clyburn empty their trunk or whatever they're doing and move out quickly. And sometimes they can't do that because there's too many cars in the parking lot circling the lot, looking for a space. This will alleviate that problem.

This is one of the busiest thrift stores and donation drop off centers in the entire Salvation Army system, and we like it, we're glad to have it in our community. But this will definitely reduce the traffic impact on the nearby busy intersection that our console alluded to which is quite bored and national so I'm in full support of this are the communities in full support of this and I urge an aye vote. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:00:16 - 3:00:43)
Brian questions for the ultimate the applicants. Hearing none. Vice Chair voice moves to pass by the same roll call it established form any objections.

Hearing on the items past. All right, I'm going to ask my vice passes revised I'm sorry. And the gavel over to my vice chair for an application in 44.

[Speaker 28] (3:00:43 - 3:01:36)
All the men are avoidance. Chairman, in the 44th Ward file number 21066, which was referred on 622 2022 for the address, commonly known as 3355 North Southport Avenue. The change request is a B three dash two community shopping district to a B three dash three community shopping district.

This, this item has a substitute narrative plans. I'm going to go now moves to accept the substitute and narrative plans for the type one application by the same roll call use determined form. Are there any objections.

Hearing none. Substitute narrative and plans are accepted. We have attorney Sarah Barnes here to present on this matter.

Sarah.

[Speaker 2] (3:01:36 - 3:04:54)
Thank you. I will like you to continue and do my full presentation because you just took a lot of the work away from me. Thank you.

I appreciate it. I'm once more for the record. My name is Sarah Barnes and I'm an attorney with the last is Sam bank.

With regard to the substitute type one narrative, I would like to note for the record that because this type one TSL application was submitted and introduced into city council in June 2022. Prior to final ratification of the subsequent community connection ordinance. We are proposing this type one be adopted pursuant to the prior provisions of the transit serve location ordinance.

And that is referenced in the substitute narrative. With that, we are here today, seeking approval of the proposed type one zoning map amendment pursuant to the transit serve location provisions of the current zoning ordinance. In order to allow for the construction of a new four story mixed use building at the subject property, which such building will feature commercial new commercial space on the first floor, and a total of six dwelling units on in between the second through fourth floors.

Because we are located the subject site is located less than 500 feet from the PTA Southport brown line entrance to the train. We are seeking this a parking reduction from six to down to one ADA compliant parking space on as alderman Tony knows the owner of the subject property and his family have own and been vested members of this particular part of the ward for many, many, many years, over a quarter of a century, and he owns several similar buildings in this neighborhood on Southport Avenue and none of those buildings have on site parking and it hasn't been demanded as well.

So that has been tested to be true so we do feel like one parking space is more than sufficient for the proposed new development. With that, pursuant to the transit serve location provisions of the zoning ordinance we are also seeking with pursuant to this type one application and increase to the maximum allowable FAR up to a 3.5, as well as a height increase. Again, that has all been set forth in the type one narrative, and is also memorialized in the, in the type one plan package towards these, and we have engaged with the Westlake view neighbors Association, and they actually had some very meaningful input on the design for the building, which can be found in the substitute plan package.

In the end, we have the favorable support of the Westlake view neighbors Association and chairman Tony if you would like to take over the microphone and have any additional comments. It's all yours.

[Speaker 28] (3:04:55 - 3:04:59)
Sarah those are my words. Yeah, I know.

[Speaker 46] (3:05:01 - 3:05:02)
Thank you.

[Speaker 28] (3:05:03 - 3:05:04)
We'd like to speak on the matter.

[Speaker 1] (3:05:04 - 3:05:32)
I would, and be brief, it made some changes. This is a new commercial, and that Southport amazing corridors so it's definitely a plus for that. And it's transit served and met with community support with some revisions and, and I support it.

So I hope my committee will support me on this application and 44.

[Speaker 28] (3:05:32 - 3:05:47)
Thank you, Chairman. If there are no questions element wagons back and make some motion do pass by the same roll call use to determine quorum. Are there any objections.

Hearing none, the item is passed with substitute narrative implants.

[Speaker 1] (3:05:48 - 3:05:48)
Thank you.

[Speaker 28] (3:05:49 - 3:05:50)
Thank you, Sarah.

[Speaker 1] (3:05:50 - 3:06:12)
All right, thank you. Moving on bottom of page 11 document number two 1062 t one in the 47th ward ordinance was referred on June 22 of 2022. Common Address 1654 West School Street, and the change request from be three to community shopping district to be to three neighborhood mixed use district, Sarah.

[Speaker 2] (3:06:13 - 3:06:46)
Last one. Last time for the record here today my name is Sarah Barnes and I'm an attorney with the lobsters and Sam being happy to be here this afternoon on behalf of the applicant school streets flat LLC. Similar to the prior matter, this a substitute type one TSL narrative along with a substitute set of plans was tendered to the Department of Planning and Development, prior to this hearing, I would please respectfully request that those substitutes be adapted into the record here today.

[Speaker 1] (3:06:46 - 3:07:00)
All of them were a boy is moves to accept the substantive narrative plans for the type one application by the same roll call it was used to determine form. Any objections. Hearing none, the substitute is in front of us.

[Speaker 2] (3:07:00 - 3:08:34)
Thank you. I'm here today because the applicant is seeking a type one zoning map amendment in order to permit the reactivation of the subject site with a new four story 17 units, all residential building that will have reduced parking for 13 vehicles as well as on site bicycle parking, parking and storage for 17 bicycles. We had a very very robust community review with by and through alderman Martin's office.

We met with the and engaged with the North Center neighbors Association as well as the Lakeview Roscoe village chamber of commerce. As well as had ongoing communications and engagement with the adjacent homeowners association, as well as the adjacent Montessori school for the programming for the new improvement. After many many months of ongoing review and engagement we are happy to advise that we have the unanimous support of all such parties for the programming that you have here before you as well I believe that alderman Martin's office tendered a copy of a letter of support for the proposal to your committee yesterday evening.

Mr. Chairman. So, with that, I read, and I just very respectfully request the approval of this honorable committee here today.

[Speaker 1] (3:08:35 - 3:08:42)
Thank you Sarah, we do have a lot of support from Alderman Martin. This is a transit serve location is it not.

[Speaker 2] (3:08:42 - 3:08:46)
It is it's actually in multiple ways it's 600.

[Speaker 1] (3:08:47 - 3:08:59)
Okay. Okay, that the answer is yes. Yes.

Was there a lot of discussion about 17 unit residential and 17 parking spaces.

[Speaker 2] (3:09:00 - 3:10:10)
So, we had originally proposed for one to one parking 17 units and 17 parking spaces and that was because the mix of units on is a little bit more unique and diverse there's more family oriented units so two bedroom units for this building rather than one, one bedroom and studios. So at the beginning, we were proposing one to one parking in case anybody had more than one vehicle. After again that robust community review on an engagement, it was determined that maybe 17 wasn't an ideal amount of parking and to reduce the parking and provide some more larger units.

So as that compromise, you will see in the substitute package that we actually went from 17 parking spaces down to 13 parking spaces, which was the mix that the community found would be appropriate and then we were able to add a couple more of those larger units. And towards that end, there are three of the 17 units are going to be affordable and those are going to be the larger unit, and those will be located on site.

[Speaker 1] (3:10:11 - 3:11:17)
All right. I sorry I asked the question. We have a letter of support from Alderman Martin questions or other comments from committee members.

Good afternoon Mr Chairman members of the committee. On behalf of the applicant Quincy Ventures Lincoln Square LLC. We are seeking to rezone the property from B one one to see one one.

This is a three unit commercial building in the Lincoln Square neighborhood. My client is seeking to rezone the property to see one one to allow for a massage establishment to locate in one of those commercial units it's about a 2900 square foot space. The property has been vacant for a little over a year year plus it used to be a chase bank.

And so we're just simply seeking to get the zoning to a classification that will allow allow my client to to move in and begin operating. We've had a lot of discussions with Alderman Martin the Chamber of Commerce, and they would like to see the property rezoned once we get our permits and our license and we have committed to doing so to rezone and actually back to a B three one. So, you know, Chairman I would say it will be back before your committee but it may be sometime next year so we'll be back in front of the zoning committee with somebody else's chair.

At some point to rezone the property. I think you should have a letter of support on file from Alderman Martin.

The change request from residential business plan development number 896 residential business plan development number 896 as amended, and be three to community shopping. All right, we did have an objector on the record right from the Chicago Council lawyers committee of civil rights is we have Lisa measure here from Brian.

Oh, okay so Brian hacker is on the, on the wall from our city department, law department.

[Speaker 9] (3:19:21 - 3:19:28)
Good afternoon Chairman Sonny and members of the community. So, my name is Brian hacker and I'm actually a planner with Brian, Brian, hold on one second.

[Speaker 1] (3:19:29 - 3:19:33)
Procedural question or question on this from all the woman hand.

[Speaker 13] (3:19:34 - 3:19:38)
It'll be a question on the matter Chairman, but we'll hear it and then we'll get to you.

[Speaker 1] (3:19:38 - 3:19:40)
All right, Brian.

[Speaker 9] (3:19:42 - 3:20:09)
Yeah, I'll just start over. So good afternoon everyone. My name is Brian hacker I'm actually with the Department of Planning and Development and not the Department of Law.

So I'm here to present this proposed amendment to plan development 896 this matter was recommended for approval by the commission, the public hearing last Thursday, September, 15, I'd like to request the transcript from that hearing be incorporated into the record for today. If you can advance the next slide please.

[Speaker 1] (3:20:09 - 3:20:34)
Let me just take the motion vice chair or boy it's normal. Incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same role follows you to determine quorum. Any objections.

Hearing none. The records are now incorporated. Continue Brian and I'm sorry.

You got promoted or demoted from the law department or the Department of Planning, I know you're with Department of Planning so my, my apologies.

[Speaker 9] (3:20:35 - 3:25:46)
No promotions. It's just, just a little bit of confusion so apologies for that. This slide shows the proposed location of the Chicago Fire Football Clubs performance center development within plan development 896 for background PDA 96 is a large redevelopment area in the near west side community, it's about 165 acres and gross site area and it's commonly known as Roosevelt Square Roosevelt Square is a mixed income development that's led by CHA and their master developer related Midwest. This amendment is a joint effort between CHA, the Chicago Fire Football Club related Midwest and DPD. Next slide please.

The purpose of the PD amendment is to facilitate development of the Chicago Fire soccer training facility. But there are going to be some other zoning changes involved here I'll get to the fire proposal in a couple slides from now. So, this was also an opportunity to make some needed zoning and master planning revisions to the PD in cooperation with related Midwest and CHA who are involved throughout this process.

There's some technical changes that are going to occur to the PD, such as what you can see here, the areas outlined in red along the east side of Ashland Avenue will be removed from the PD boundary. It's going to result in the reduction in gross site area of roughly four acres, and these sites will be rezone to be a B3 dash three shop business district. Next slide please.

Another change will be made to the PD and this amendment is to modify the sub area boundaries to create dedicated sub areas for the Chicago fires project which you can see in sub area G on the western edge there, and also Adams Medill Park, which is now within sub area, the revised sub area boundaries are also going to redistribute density throughout the other undeveloped areas of the PD, due to the inclusion of the fire project. Next slide please.

So, the primary purpose of this PD amendment is to facilitate the development of the Chicago fires performance center training facility is proposed for a 24.2 acre site on land that's jointly owned by the CHA and Chicago fire. As you can see in this rendering here it'll consist of a two story building, there's going to be 142 parking spaces proposed. There are three soccer pitches at the north end there in the darker green that are proposed for their youth academy, and also roughly two and a half soccer pitches that are devoted to their professional team which are in the lighter area green area there.

The youth academy that's at the northwest corner of the site so this would be kind of to the upper left in the view that you see here would be the site of a temporary inflatable dome during the cold weather months so roughly November to March. The fire is currently located or the training facilities currently located in Bridgeview, Illinois, so this would bring their administrative and practice locations back to the city of Chicago. This facility also hosts its academy program, and some other youth soccer programs that provide mentorship and internship opportunities, as well as recreational opportunities for young people in the community.

The fire CHA and related been holding meetings with community stakeholders resident groups and members of the public since January, and several of these meetings were held in partnership with DPD and the 28th ward Alderman Jason urban. Next slide please. So, being a complicated PD.

This amendment also allowed CHA and related Midwest to come in and make some updates, make some needed updates to the Roosevelt Square master plan, and then revise the PD accordingly so they are planning to redistribute density and units to areas like Roosevelt Road, and the northern portion of the PD and your Taylor Street and scene, you can see on the map here in those kind of mustard colored areas as you can see those are some areas that are identified for increased density, and because of the fires proposed development, it's not going to result in a significant change to the plan number of units within this PD just shifted around to other locations within the boundary.

Next slide please. And this concept plan which was generated by related Midwest, their consultant team shows the focus areas for new development, where the residential units. Some already previously planned and some of the units that would have been planned for the fires location will be distributed to you within the PD boundary.

And this is a updated view of their master plan. So, to conclude all the nerve and spoke at last week's plan commission hearing in support of this project, and I would respectfully request the committee's approval for this item. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:25:46 - 3:26:33)
All right, I know we're going to hear from Alderman urban, we do have before we get to the first question from all the woman. Brian. There was the narrative says, we're doing a development and amendment to residential business plan development 896.

And then we're adding as amended and a B three to community shopping district. So, what is everything is, you said, you're going to take a few parcels out to a B three three chairman knows the parcels along Ashland. Okay.

[Speaker 10] (3:26:33 - 3:26:41)
Those are the parcels along gas. Yeah, part of the original PD and to that no longer are.

[Speaker 39] (3:26:42 - 3:26:43)
Okay.

[Speaker 9] (3:26:43 - 3:26:56)
And it is to a B three dash three zoning district that it's getting changed to if it said a B three dash two I'm almost positive that that was a typo, so I apologize for that.

[Speaker 1] (3:26:58 - 3:27:13)
All right, that's, that was my question. In the, in our written, it says B three two versus B three three. So, Noah is that it's all kosher.

[Speaker 38] (3:27:15 - 3:27:26)
B three three is the recommended district from the department Alderman I'll check on the final version that was sent your way if not we'll get that corrected right away it should have been in the final publication packet as B three three.

[Speaker 37] (3:27:26 - 3:27:45)
And if I may interject chairman. This is Mariah degree now from DLA Piper representing the Chicago fire just as a procedural matter on that point. I believe that was a change made since the city filed the application so we may need the committee to accept what the submitted materials today as a substitute ordinance.

[Speaker 4] (3:27:49 - 3:27:53)
And I'll defer to know if you want to chime in on that point to the copies now.

[Speaker 1] (3:27:54 - 3:27:59)
So Noah, are we going to accept a substitute on this B three three or.

[Speaker 38] (3:28:01 - 3:28:05)
We should do so Alderman and we'll correct the documents according chairman sorry.

[Speaker 1] (3:28:06 - 3:28:41)
Okay. All right. So, all of all the woman, or I'm sorry alderman.

Vice Chair rebellious moves on the substance. Okay, so Alderman rebellious moves to accept the substitute by the same roll call it was used to determine quorum, and then any objections to that, which we just understood now is from a B three two to B three three on those three parcels. Good.

Noah, right.

[Speaker 38] (3:28:42 - 3:28:43)
Correct.

[Speaker 1] (3:28:43 - 3:29:04)
Okay, so all men voice makes move to accept the substitute any objections to that. No objections to that particular portion of it. The substitute is before us.

And with that, I think the presentation is over.

[Speaker 47] (3:29:08 - 3:29:09)
Yes, that's correct.

[Speaker 1] (3:29:10 - 3:29:13)
Brian. Okay. All right.

So we'll start with.

[Speaker 38] (3:29:13 - 3:29:35)
Sorry, Chairman, Chairman, this is Noah, I just want to let the record reflect the final for publication stamped ordinance is a substitute to be accepted but it is correct in its documentation that was provided to the committee. It just needs to have the word substitute added to the top, we will do so and send another copy to through Nicole. But the, but the B three three is correct in the documents that were sent to the committee.

[Speaker 1] (3:29:36 - 3:29:49)
Okay, just so we keep it all is as accurate as we can. All right. Thanks Noah.

We'll start with other woman hadn't.

[Speaker 13] (3:29:49 - 3:30:10)
Thanks chair. I guess my questions are going to speak to the concern that the public commenter brought up and I think many of us received some information about this as well through the committee. Is there anyone from CHA on the line who can speak to us about the, about the plan development changes.

[Speaker 1] (3:30:11 - 3:30:21)
Okay, we do have, I think, Miss McKenzie. Yep. Is here from CHA.

So, we do so continue. Other woman.

[Speaker 13] (3:30:22 - 3:31:30)
Awesome. Thanks. I guess Miss McKenzie.

The primary concern here right is, you know, from from the latest kind of planned forward from 2016. CHA is well and far behind its goals of creating affordable housing that it destroyed years ago and so seeing this change the biggest concern. As you can imagine right is CHA, the authority who's who's in charge of kind of managing so many of our federal dollars and our subsidized housing and even by your own plan this seems to interfere with that right.

So this plan does not add to any affordable housing, though it will create some revenue for you to kind of continue to maintain or make some improvements. That's clear. What, how, how is this going to impact the your obligation, I guess to build 775 units of public housing within this PD and can you speak to the timeline of when the public can expect that housing to be created.

[Speaker 3] (3:31:30 - 3:35:06)
Sure, sure and I really appreciate that. One thing that Noah mentioned or that Brian mentioned which was very important and it really came up when we did the last development which we did, which closed in 2019 which was the, the late Taylor Street apartments, so if you haven't seen them on Taylor Street they're, they're quite impressive, but that actually took an amendment to, to the PD that this PD has been amended many many times so when we went to Noah and said wait, we need to amend it he was actually cited I hope you will agree with that Noah.

So, part of what I did want to make clear that the land over even on Ashland. We don't own that the CFA doesn't own that land so we said, why is it in this PD. But I do think what has happened is each phase has not really complied with the existing PD so we took advantage of this opportunity.

The other part of it which I think is your main question which is commitment. Housing is what we do housing at Roosevelt Square and our other CHA housing on the site, we own Loomis courts, we own homes. We own hundreds of units on this site.

So we both have to preserve them and build new. We actually welcome this as an opportunity to build community and have worked incredibly hard with the fire to make this something that would push housing. So you'll see in this, I'm glad that this slide that's up because you'll see housing to the north of the proposed development housing to the south of it.

These were sites that we that my team had been struggling with, with related so we actually think this is an improved plan. The other parts is it's responding to the changes in the community, so that there is a site over on Blue Island for the southeast you'll see here that we didn't know what to do with a while ago. And now we will be responding to a community that has embraced this area so we do not think we're going to struggle there at all, figuring out the housing.

This is a good mix of elevator buildings for accessibility walk ups larger units for larger families, smaller units for our primary waitlist. And we actually are embracing this as a solution to a problem which we've had which is pushing this forward. The next phase you asked about this the next phase we are busily working on right now.

It's been into HUD for a while it will close by November, I am crossing fingers I'm sorry I think you know that interest rates affect us just like everybody else with mixed income. And that will be three buildings, as well as units that will allow the National Public Housing Museum to complete so it will be partly units which we're really excited about. We are pushing them for the next phase which is proposed to be homeownership.

We have had a lot of discussion with the aldermen in the community. And at the same time that homeownership we're talking about the next phase of rental, which would again be a building or two, we're really prioritizing Roosevelt, and then probably Blue Island, and then the homeownership is owed up closer to Taylor. In the end, there are lots of units to bring back, and we embrace this as building community, bringing a neighbor who wants to balance with housing, and we think this is going to push it, but we do have a long way to go.

[Speaker 13] (3:35:07 - 3:35:34)
Can I guess it's a clarifying question and I appreciate. Thank you for being here for that answer, and for sharing some of the complexity. I didn't hear any numbers, so like I want to ask this again.

How many units of affordable rental housing will this change, create this change is neutral.

[Speaker 3] (3:35:34 - 3:35:36)
So our commitment remains the same.

[Speaker 13] (3:35:37 - 3:35:45)
And then the phase in November that's kind of the next step that you're going to get done. How many units of affordable housing is that going to create I know you mentioned there's some.

[Speaker 3] (3:35:46 - 3:35:57)
It's 80 for CHA 45 other tax credit. And we are under a court order still so then there's market rate so it's a total of 222 units.

[Speaker 13] (3:35:57 - 3:36:27)
So that's the November phase. Yeah. And does the 200 plus units count towards the 775 at CHA is on is on the hook for just just for CHA families, right, just for CHA family so we will still owe 500 units when we're done with that.

Gotcha. And then for this phase right so what's kind of planned here. How much is the CHA spending on this project, anything.

[Speaker 3] (3:36:28 - 3:36:33)
No, we are actually. This is a market rate, we are being paid.

[Speaker 13] (3:36:34 - 3:36:46)
Okay. And then for the second phase that you think in November. Do you guys have any estimates of if all goes well, according to plan, I guess I'm what are what we put into a deal.

[Speaker 3] (3:36:46 - 3:37:07)
Well, how to expect that I mean we do pay for, for, for, for our units right either the city pays or we pay. And it is. I'm sorry.

It's a little tricky because we've gotten good with the financing on it. So, um, but it's hundreds of thousands of dollars per CHA unit, and that's what we measure against.

[Speaker 13] (3:37:08 - 3:38:08)
So then my next question I guess speaks to the concerns that our public commenter and the Chicago Housing Coalition right and kind of others have brought up to what's the legal assessment here it's really difficult I'll say, you know, we had news earlier this year of a colleague of ours right who's been on the CHA waitlist for 30 years and finally got a call. I have a lot of residents in my 75% renter ward here in the 49th, who are on CHA waitlist, we're dealing with record levels of people experiencing homelessness, which is crashing around us. So it's it's concerning to me to see, I guess, such sluggishness, and I don't know if you can speak to the legal concerns that people might have that the CHA leasing some of its property that could be used to develop housing or something other than housing could put the CHA or the city in trouble legally, I could you speak to that.

[Speaker 3] (3:38:10 - 3:39:12)
We are required to go through an approval process with HUD. We have. We have definitely used our land for other community assets, so we have grocery stores on some of our land.

We have definitely used our funding that even help pay for parks. Schools are important. So we have done this before.

It's incredibly important that we do it the right way I agree it. And we are working diligently with the city to actually identify other affordable. I mean developers in the community who are looking for project based vouchers also because remember we bring up, we, we bring a tool, also, so we don't limit ourselves to our land.

I think most of you know that housing choice vouchers and project based vouchers are important also. So I don't know if I really answered your question but I think legally, we will, we, we do need the Declaration of Trust removed that that you've heard about and that is a process for us.

[Speaker 13] (3:39:12 - 3:39:17)
So has HUD, has HUD not approved this use yet.

[Speaker 4] (3:39:18 - 3:39:29)
They have not. Thank you. And thank you.

Let's see, we have David Moore, Alderman Moore.

[Speaker 14] (3:39:32 - 3:40:45)
Thank you, Chairman. Hi Anna, as you know, this is near and dear to my heart. First of all, when the mayor took over in 1999 to come over to the CHA in an effort to make sure the residents were taken care of for the simple fact that I came from public housing.

And I worked closely with many of the LAC presidents, including the Board of Beverly although that was Tim Beamstress development at the time. I still work closely with a lot of those LAC presidents, either as a development manager or as a senior advisor of operations at CHA. My question is, and it's important to me.

And I know the Alderman has done his due diligence but still it's important for me that these two questions be answered. One, what do we have a letter for support from the CAC. And two, do we have a letter of support from the local advisory council there.

[Speaker 3] (3:40:49 - 3:41:17)
The CAC, we don't have a letter, we've certainly met with them multiple, multiple times. So, and then the LAC, we actually have been, it's more than, we don't have a letter because we're working on that agreement of what we spend funds on from this and we are also getting what we are working on with them is of course jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs.

[Speaker 14] (3:41:17 - 3:41:21)
And you don't have to go into detail, respectfully and you don't have to go to detail.

[Speaker 3] (3:41:21 - 3:41:22)
Okay.

[Speaker 14] (3:41:22 - 3:41:27)
At this point we have no letter of support from the CAC or the LAC, correct.

[Speaker 3] (3:41:28 - 3:41:35)
The LAC has not been asked for a letter we've been working with them and we, they have at a community meeting supported it.

[Speaker 14] (3:41:35 - 3:41:37)
But we don't have a letter yet from either one.

[Speaker 3] (3:41:38 - 3:41:39)
No. Okay.

[Speaker 14] (3:41:40 - 3:41:56)
And until I'm comfortable by the time hopefully city council. I cannot support this item without a letter of support from the CAC, or the LAC, and that's all I'll say to that. I'm done.

Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (3:41:56 - 3:42:00)
All right. I'm alderman see Joe Lopez.

[Speaker 15] (3:42:00 - 3:43:04)
Thank you, Chairman. I'm just following up on the line of questioning, and I do have part of the PD on the east side of Loomis not exactly in the location where this is taking place this project but I have been working closely with Alderman Irving. We have been able to push forward.

Some of the previous commitments, since especially 2003 with related Midwest. My concern, and I think the question I know Chairman you asked. It is someone maybe from the law department or someone from, you know, the CHA law department that can answer directly the letter from the lawyers committee for civil rights, especially around the federal housing laws.

Just given the fact that hot is still yet to approve these. There's, you know, a numbers of concerns especially letters is still waiting so I just want to see maybe someone from the law department or CHA law department can answer the concerns that submitted by the lawyers committee for civil rights and other organizations.

[Speaker 1] (3:43:06 - 3:43:45)
All right. And McKenzie. Do we have anybody CHA law or anybody from the city.

Well, even though Brian's here with Department of Planning but I think the question from alderman CTO Lopez isn't is somebody like Lisa Misher who's on the application is Miss Fisher. I'm sorry. Lisa Misher Are you on the call or and McKenzie.

We, we want to be able to answer the alderman's questions from the Chicago lawyers committee civil rights.

[Speaker 3] (3:43:48 - 3:43:57)
And I apologize we do not have a lawyer from CHA on this we did receive the letter last night. So, let me see what I can do.

[Speaker 10] (3:43:59 - 3:44:03)
Chairman, I believe we do have Lisa Misher here. I think she's just muted.

[Speaker 1] (3:44:04 - 3:44:08)
All right, let's see if we can hear from Lisa Misher.

[Speaker 5] (3:44:12 - 3:44:20)
Hi, I'm not familiar with the letter this came when last night. Yes, I haven't seen I have not seen a copy of the letter.

[Speaker 1] (3:44:23 - 3:44:57)
All right, well we will be sending will be sending it to you momentarily. But the. I'm not going to speak for the Council of lawyers and civil rights but they were on the public comment period.

Basically, questioning the use of this private land and the commitment to housing. Overall, with the CHA. So I guess this, this use runs in conflict at least from a perception wise with a number of our committee members.

[Speaker 5] (3:44:59 - 3:45:28)
I guess the. My response would be that nothing can happen on this property without approval. And so, although this will be.

This is providing plan development approval. That's that doesn't allow anything to move forward until you know the CHA and HUD are in agreement that the land is being used in a proper way.

[Speaker 1] (3:45:31 - 3:45:34)
All right. Alderman Sitio Lopez.

[Speaker 15] (3:45:35 - 3:46:00)
So this is exactly my next question is HUD and CHA in agreement with this use I understand and I was in planning commission that was a, I think a critical question, especially since we have another investigation with HUD because of another issue so I want to make sure that you know this, this is a question that must be answered. If HUD and CHA are okay and in agreement with the use of this land.

[Speaker 1] (3:46:01 - 3:46:25)
All right. Any of you heard the response. This is a zoning process, this is not being approved without HUD and CHA coming to an agreement about replacement and about the use of the land.

Is that correct, Lisa. Correct. All right, whether we agree with that or not, that's the response.

All right.

[Speaker 15] (3:46:55 - 3:48:02)
I know there's still public housing units I think the total is 1800. So, what is the procedure, what is what are we going to ensure I mean this is from 2003 to now that we had agreement with related Midwest. we only fulfilled a third of that.

How are we going to ensure that this, another private public partnership does not delay or create yet another delay when we are still at a third or lower? So my concern is that, you know, with a housing crisis at hand, we're still delaying building housing. We did, I think, a good job with our urban Irving, pushing a phase in Roosevelt Square.

But the fact of the matter is that we're still waiting, you know, for at least 1,800 units of housing. What is the timeline of how we want to make sure that this is actually fulfilled with being a timeline that is accurate? Because what we have seen so far has been, you know, and again, this is a third that is already a compromise.

The original, the need was for 3,600 units. So we only deliver at 10% of that. Again, my question is how are we going to ensure that we are not get back in this situation given the housing crisis?

[Speaker 1] (3:48:06 - 3:48:13)
I think that's more aligned with Anne from CHA, that question.

[Speaker 3] (3:48:14 - 3:49:10)
Sure, and I appreciate it. And I do want to reiterate that changing the zoning is going to help us speed some things up because every phase we've had to deal with an old PD that wasn't working. My other point was the local advisory council is for the Brooks Homes that is existing public housing.

So the leader of that local advisory council does sit on our working group to plan all of Roosevelt Square. All right, so I just want to make that clear. The local advisory council has been consulted from the beginning of this.

We've been talking to them about this from February on about this. They've been at the table with us. And the question is, how do we make sure this happens?

Well, as a zoning thing, I think this helps us speed things up. It's not giving us the financing and everything else. I appreciate that everyone wants us to move.

Of course, that is my job to try to make this move.

[Speaker 1] (3:49:11 - 3:49:17)
All right. Alderman Lopez, do you have another question?

[Speaker 15] (3:49:17 - 3:49:46)
No, just, you know, and I'll end it with this. I think my concern with some of the, you know, some of the letters that were submitted by the lowest community rights, as well as at least 70 residents. And again, I'm going to follow up with the LAC just to have a, you know, a more in-depth discussion.

My concern is with the due process, making sure that we don't rush in things. I understand we want to speed up things, but the due process is important. So please, Chairman, I'd like to be recorded as a no.

Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 47] (3:49:47 - 3:49:48)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (3:49:49 - 3:49:51)
Duly recorded. Alderman Patel.

[Speaker 8] (3:49:55 - 3:50:13)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Wanted just to ask the CHA. I think the Chicago fire is in a long-term lease.

Is that correct? For this land? It would be a long-term lease, yes.

What's the terms of that lease and how much are they paying the CHA for the lease?

[Speaker 3] (3:50:16 - 3:50:21)
It's 40 years with some renewals, possible renewals.

[Speaker 8] (3:50:21 - 3:50:22)
How many renewals?

[Speaker 3] (3:50:22 - 3:50:22)
Two renewals.

[Speaker 8] (3:50:23 - 3:50:33)
How many renewals and what are the terms of the renewals? 40 year, two potential 10 year renewals. Okay, so how much are they paying for this lease?

[Speaker 3] (3:50:34 - 3:50:56)
Appraised value has it, after some environmental modifications we're making, it's going to start at about $750,000 to $800,000 a year, and it will increase every year, and we will reassess with new appraisals after 20 years and then every 10 years.

[Speaker 8] (3:50:57 - 3:51:00)
Okay, and how much is the remediation cost here?

[Speaker 3] (3:51:02 - 3:51:13)
Remediation costs, like all of our sites, is significant. It's millions of dollars, and we are going to reassess that after remediation is done, like we would on our other sites.

[Speaker 8] (3:51:13 - 3:51:16)
Right, I asked you how much is the remediation cost?

[Speaker 3] (3:51:17 - 3:51:39)
Right, we're thinking it's about $4 million. $4 million? If it's less, but if it's less, then we won't pay that opposite.

And there is an $8 million give on top of that, all of this, from the fire. I'm sorry, I didn't hear you say that. There's an additional $8 million from the fire on top of this, on top of that lease.

[Speaker 8] (3:51:40 - 3:51:58)
So on top of the yearly costs of between $700,000 and $800,000 a year, they're giving the CHA $8 million? $8 million. And the remediation costs, are they assuming the cost for that, or is that, who's paying for that?

[Speaker 3] (3:51:59 - 3:52:14)
That's why it's the 750 to 800, the first few years, while that is being, they will pay the environmental, they will pay for it, but then it will reduce the lease a little bit every year.

[Speaker 1] (3:52:14 - 3:52:49)
Okay, so let me interrupt for a second. Thank you. So just so we get the numbers, while this is zoning, I think the question is, what are they paying?

So bar none, they're paying $8 million, right? And we heard the terms of the lease, but the remediation could cost up to 400, or I'm sorry, 4 million, 4 million. So that would be credited towards years one through whatever until the remediation costs were fully paid.

So they might not be paying for the first five years.

[Speaker 3] (3:52:49 - 3:52:54)
No, they will be paying. That's the net after that remediation.

[Speaker 1] (3:52:55 - 3:52:57)
Oh, so you've already built that?

[Speaker 3] (3:52:57 - 3:52:58)
We've built that in that number.

[Speaker 1] (3:53:01 - 3:53:15)
Okay, so the minimum payment will be 700, 800,000 a year. Yep. And then how does the 4 million get reimbursed?

[Speaker 3] (3:53:18 - 3:53:19)
That's that reduction.

[Speaker 1] (3:53:21 - 3:53:27)
Okay, so year, let's say year six then, is that, what does that rent go up to then?

[Speaker 3] (3:53:29 - 3:53:30)
It'll be based on CPI.

[Speaker 1] (3:53:31 - 3:53:38)
And this is- It's not, we're not the budget committee, but- Yeah, I was about to say- Chairman Daly is our budget chairman.

[Speaker 3] (3:53:38 - 3:53:43)
There's no city money going into this transaction, and there's no CHA money going into the transaction.

[Speaker 1] (3:53:43 - 3:53:47)
I think it was the value of the private benefit. I think it was the value of the private benefit.

[Speaker 8] (3:53:47 - 3:54:02)
I'm trying to see what kind of deal the Chicago Fire got, you know? Yep. They're a corporation.

Yep. Doing really, I think doing well. And I just want to see if they're paying their fair share.

Sure, sure.

[Speaker 3] (3:54:02 - 3:54:08)
We definitely, we had an appraisal and we did a study of similar facilities throughout the country.

[Speaker 8] (3:54:09 - 3:54:39)
Thank you. All right, thank you. The second question, the 775, I'm not getting into, you know, whether or not that number's right or not, you know, what's the CHA promised and blah, blah, blah, blah.

But the 775 public housing replacement units, you say you're going to address 200 of them through this project or in this?

[Speaker 3] (3:54:40 - 3:54:48)
I was just talking about the next phase, which is about to close. And that will be 80 CHA out of about 200 units.

[Speaker 8] (3:54:50 - 3:55:07)
Okay, so you're only getting 80 in the next phase? Yes. So then my question is the remaining 600 and whatever, 80 is from 775.

Where are those units going?

[Speaker 3] (3:55:08 - 3:55:34)
So to date, we've already returned 282 units per CHA. And a total of 434 units. So then these 80 will be added to that.

So then we have about a little more than 500 units and we have 20 acres on the site. And then our agreements allow for also within a half a mile of the site.

[Speaker 8] (3:55:35 - 3:55:42)
Okay, one half mile. So of the 20 acres you have on site, how many of those units can get back there?

[Speaker 3] (3:55:43 - 3:55:57)
We show that they all can at the same time. If it's more expedient to do some offsite, we'll try to, and we'll go above and beyond if we can.

[Speaker 8] (3:56:00 - 3:56:05)
All right, that's the extent of my questions, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:56:08 - 3:56:15)
I think Alderman Irvin's on the call. Would you like to opine on this at all, Jason?

[Speaker 10] (3:56:15 - 4:00:58)
Yes, yeah. First of all, I want to thank CHA for their hard work toward listening to the area residents from the Brooks Oblomis Courts Advisory Council, as well as the CAC with Commissioner Francine Washington, all of whom have been at the table with this from its inception. Also want to thank the Chicago Fire for engaging and listening to members of the community and actually standing with members of the community in some, I'll call disagreements amongst the parties.

But nonetheless, I think the Chicago Fire will be a good neighbor for residents in the Oblomis community, and have demonstrated that throughout this process. And I believe we'll continue to do that as they want to be good neighbors or for residents on the near west side of Chicago. The concerns that have been raised, I believe are valid given the state of where things are with CHA and what has transpired over the last almost 20 years into this plan for transformation.

It was extremely important to me, and I think important to the residents that we know and understand how this change in use for those, for the acreage where the fire will go, the impact not only just on CHA residents, but the impact on the community at large in Roosevelt Square and beyond. We've gone through a process approximately four or five years ago on tabletop exercises and the like of how do we place and have all of these units, scale, density, and all of that. And now we've made an adjustment to that in scale and in density.

One of the most important components of this, not only that residents and CHA be satisfied, but that the community residents be satisfied because this was going to cause an increase in density in some areas that had not planned to have density in the past. And we've had those through community meetings and everyone is in a good space with this. The work that Anne talked about that was done with the Taylor Street Apartments demonstrated to the residents that we can do density, make it look good, and keep it managed and well run and maintained, and also deliver community amenities.

As part of this as well, which is separate, the next 200 plus units that will be coming on delivers again, community amenities at the same time we're preserving and bringing back additional affordable and public housing units to the area. So everyone over here is hitting, doing as a community and working together and trying to meet the needs of all parties that are concerned. And I believe that as we continue moving at this pace, which we've done 80 units a couple of years ago, another 80 units are gonna hit this year.

And if we continue moving through these phases as outlined, we can reach the obligation, not only to public housing residents, but also an obligation on delivering on equity as relates to having affordable units, public housing units, as well as market rate units in this immediate area. And granted, this is a drop in the bucket to the number of overall affordable units that exist in this immediate area between the Circle Park Apartments. And also we just finished a couple, about a month ago, the Barbara Jean Wright Court Apartments.

We have a ton of affordable units that are in this immediate area. And we wanna continue to deliver on that for residents that live in and around the Oblo, Barbara Jean Wright and Circle Park communities. So I believe that this continues and actually doubles down on doing that, as well as on the dollar raised question around revenue, which is the primary source of the renovation of the Brooks Homes and Movers Courts Apartments.

So I think this helps catalyze the development, helps catalyze moving this project along. And again, I'm glad that the Chicago Fire did step up and become a good corporate partner and a good corporate citizen to the residents of the community, as well as helping CHA to deliver on a long-term promise that in many people's opinion had been broken to the residents of the Oblo community, primarily the Brooks Homes and Movers Courts Apartments. So with that, I'll ask for a favorable consideration from the committee and also if anyone has any questions, I'll be happy to answer.

[Speaker 1] (4:01:00 - 4:01:22)
Questions for Alderman Irvin? Comments, we heard a lot. Alderman Irvin is asking for a motion.

We don't have a motion yet. Okay, all right. So we need a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that we used to determine quorum on this issue.

[Speaker 13] (4:01:22 - 4:01:25)
I'd like to be recorded as a no, Chairman, Alderman Hatton.

[Speaker 1] (4:01:26 - 4:01:28)
I still need a motion, so.

[Speaker 32] (4:01:28 - 4:01:36)
Chairman, I'll make the motion as long as we can do a roll call, or no, just I'll make the motion to pass for Alderman Irvin.

[Speaker 14] (4:01:36 - 4:01:38)
And David Moore is a no, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (4:01:38 - 4:02:04)
Okay, well, let me do one step at a time. So the motion was made by Alderman Boggis-Pack to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. I've heard a couple objections.

David Moore is a no, Maria Haddon is a no, Alderman Mike Rodriguez has his hand up, Michael.

[Speaker 22] (4:02:05 - 4:02:07)
Just to be recorded as a no.

[Speaker 1] (4:02:08 - 4:02:13)
That was our third no. Hold on, hold on, hold on a second.

[Speaker 13] (4:02:14 - 4:02:18)
Chairman, I believe Alderman Siccio-Lopez had asked to be recorded as a no earlier.

[Speaker 1] (4:02:19 - 4:02:24)
Okay, let me confirm that. Let me see, Alderman Siccio-Lopez, you are a no?

[Speaker 15] (4:02:25 - 4:02:28)
That's right, Chairman, thank you. Okay, yeah.

[Speaker 1] (4:02:28 - 4:02:31)
And then I heard Alderman Dowell.

[Speaker 8] (4:02:33 - 4:02:37)
That's correct, no. Okay. Roll call, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (4:02:39 - 4:02:57)
All right, so there is a request for a roll call on this item, and we do, correct me, staff, we do have a quorum here? Okay, all right, here we go. All right, Vice Chair Ravoyos.

[Speaker 47] (4:02:57 - 4:02:58)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (4:02:58 - 4:03:07)
That's an aye. Alderman Hopkins, Alderwoman Dowell, repeat.

No.

[Speaker 1] (4:03:10 - 4:03:18)

[Speaker 10] (4:03:20 - 4:03:20)
No.

[Speaker 1] (4:03:23 - 4:03:47)
Alderman Siccio-Lopez, oh, I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry. Well, I'm sorry, I'm going, I'm in my order.

Seven. Seven nays. One, two, three, four, five.

Yay, so this item will not pass out of committee today.

[Speaker 47] (4:05:15 - 4:05:30)
All right. All right.

[Speaker 4] (4:05:31 - 4:05:32)
Let's move on.

[Speaker 10] (4:05:35 - 4:05:38)
We are- Thank you, thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (4:05:38 - 4:05:40)
All right, we'll be back for another day.

[Speaker 4] (4:05:41 - 4:05:52)
All right, let's see. Let's keep going. What page are we on?

We are on page 13.

[Speaker 1] (4:05:52 - 4:06:26)
Okay, folks, we're on the bottom of page 13, document number 21014, T1, in the 10th ward. The ordinance was referred on April 27th of 2022. The common address is 10759 South Burley Avenue.

And the change request from M12, Limited Manufacturing Business Park District to C12 Neighborhood Commercial District. And we have Marina, I'm sorry, Maria Medina on this item.

[Speaker 31] (4:06:29 - 4:06:57)
Hi. Good afternoon. My name is Giancarlo Medina.

And today I'll be speaking on behalf of my mom, the owner of the property just coming, known as 10759 South Burley Avenue. And today we were seeking to return the property from M1-2 to C1-2 in order to establish a small banquet hall. We have noticed that in our community- Well, hold on a second.

Hold on a second. You're a little ahead of yourself now.

[Speaker 1] (4:06:57 - 4:07:05)
So we had Maria as the witness. Is Maria on the call? Yeah, that's my mom.

[Speaker 25] (4:07:05 - 4:07:06)
She's right here.

[Speaker 1] (4:07:06 - 4:07:09)
Okay, wait, I'm not asking. Let me just talk to Maria for a second.

[Speaker 19] (4:07:10 - 4:07:10)
Okay, I'm here.

[Speaker 1] (4:07:11 - 4:07:14)
Okay. Now, Maria, you are the owner of the property, correct?

[Speaker 21] (4:07:15 - 4:07:17)
Correct. Me and my husband, yes.

[Speaker 1] (4:07:17 - 4:07:22)
And you are, you know, according to our records, you're representing yourself in front of this committee.

[Speaker 23] (4:07:23 - 4:07:23)
Correct.

[Speaker 1] (4:07:23 - 4:07:30)
Okay. Now, this other individual is, I believe, a relative of yours?

[Speaker 46] (4:07:31 - 4:07:34)
It is my oldest son. My English is not that good.

[Speaker 1] (4:07:34 - 4:07:54)
No problem. I don't need, your English is good enough. Okay.

Okay. So Carlos will be representing, Carlos Medina will be the witness in regards to this application. And you have obviously delegated that responsibility to him, correct?

[Speaker 5] (4:07:55 - 4:07:56)
Correct, yes.

[Speaker 1] (4:07:57 - 4:08:09)
Okay. So that, now we just, for the benefit of the committee, we can now hear from Carlos Medina on behalf of this application on 10759 South Burley. Okay.

[Speaker 31] (4:08:09 - 4:08:58)
So Carlos Medina, you can proceed. Would you like me to start over? Yeah, start over.

Okay. Okay, so good afternoon, everyone. My name is Giancarlo Medina, and today I will be speaking on behalf of my mom, the owner of the property commonly known as 10759 South Burley Avenue.

And today we are seeking to rezone the property from M1-2 to C1-2 in order to establish a small banquet hall. We have noticed that our community lacks halls that are designated for special events. And although there are many halls in the city of Chicago, we do feel that our community would appreciate a small hall within the community.

And if anybody has any questions, I'll- Okay.

[Speaker 1] (4:08:59 - 4:09:05)
All right. Now you've spoken to Alderwoman Sadlowski-Garza?

[Speaker 32] (4:09:05 - 4:09:06)
Yes, that's correct.

[Speaker 1] (4:09:07 - 4:09:24)
Okay. And staff, we have a letter of support from Alderwoman Garza. All right.

And it also went to the Planning Commission. So this is the second round of public hearings. All right.

Anna Robles.

[Speaker 44] (4:09:25 - 4:09:29)
I was just mentioning that it did go through Planning Commission, so we can introduce that.

[Speaker 1] (4:09:31 - 4:10:11)
Okay. So we need to incorporate the records. All right.

So let's start by incorporating the records of the Planning Commission. So Alderman Beal moves to incorporate the records from the Planning Commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, the records are incorporated. So we've heard of the request and we do have the support of the local Alderwoman. I only had to have one quick question.

You talk about the size of this banquet hall. Tell me a little bit more about how big and where the parking is.

[Speaker 31] (4:10:12 - 4:10:26)
So the hall can accommodate up to 120 guests. Well, that is the maximum number, 120 guests. And then we will have a total of 13 parking spaces for the guests in the adjacent lot with the property.

[Speaker 1] (4:10:27 - 4:10:37)
And then in general, you had a meeting with the Alderman and the local residents and everything's kosher, everything's okay with them?

[Speaker 31] (4:10:37 - 4:10:47)
Yes, we actually spoke with the Alderwoman and she okayed everything. She gave us her support.

[Speaker 1] (4:10:48 - 4:11:16)
Okay, so that's important to our committee for sure. I just wanted to get a little bit more of the process that went through the community and she is the representative there. So I know that there was another question about another banquet hall somewhere in that ward and such.

So I just wanna make sure we're all clear on this one. This is the one that she's very much in support of, correct? Okay, other questions, comments?

[Speaker 40] (4:11:18 - 4:11:20)
Move do pass Alderman Hopkins.

[Speaker 1] (4:11:20 - 4:11:34)
All right, that's Alderman Hopkins moves do pass on this item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Objections? Hearing none, this item is passed as revised.

Good luck to you. Thank you very much.

[Speaker 47] (4:11:34 - 4:11:34)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (4:11:34 - 4:12:12)
Thank you. Okay, okay. So our two o'clock rules committee is going to start immediately after this committee members.

Thank you. Let's keep moving, right? As staff tells me.

All right, top of page 14, document number 20994, 16th Ward. Ordinance was referred in April 27th of 2022. Common address 914 West 63rd Street and the change request C13, neighborhood commercial district to C13 neighborhood commercial district and then to a residential plan development.

Graham Grady.

[Speaker 24] (4:12:14 - 4:12:16)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman. Can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (4:12:17 - 4:12:20)
Yes, and we're on a time constraint.

[Speaker 24] (4:12:20 - 4:12:37)
I understand. Chairman Toney and members of the committee. My name is Graham Grady.

I'm pleased to represent the applicant, Thrive Anglewood LLC, along with my co-counsel Sylvia Micas. I request that the record of the July 21st, 2022 plan commission hearing be entered into the record of this committee, please.

[Speaker 1] (4:12:38 - 4:12:51)
Vice-chair Roboius would incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call as you to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the records are incorporated and before us, please continue.

[Speaker 24] (4:12:51 - 4:15:05)
Thank you very much. I will be extremely brief. We have representatives of our team that are available to answer questions.

If you could please advance to the next slide. You can see the location of this property at West 63rd Street at West 63rd Parkway and South Peoria Drive. This is an attractive rendering of the building designed by Perkins and Will.

The purpose of the application today is in furtherance of the City of Chicago Invest Southwest program. We will be developing this into a two phase building. It will include affordable housing.

It will include live workspaces. It will include amenities and off-street parking. The applicant seeks to acquire this property from the City of Chicago and it's been working closely with both the Department of Housing as well as Department of Planning and Development.

The project was approved by the Chicago Plan Commission and it's been reviewed and approved by all the other bureaus that have reviewed it including Fire Prevention, CDOT, Stormwater and AIS. Here you can see the aerial view. This is very near 63rd and Halsted.

It's a transit oriented location. The applicant will comply with all the requirements of the plan development including goals regarding MBE and WB set aside. As I mentioned, there are live work units here.

There is affordable housing units incorporated into the project. We are fortunate to have a letter of support from Alderman Coleman. We thank the Alderman for her assistance in the review and furtherance of this project.

We also would like to thank all the staff of the Department of Planning and Development, Patrick Prudish, Lisa Washington, Noah Sofranik as well as staff of the Department of Housing. I'm happy to answer any questions. I apologize I'm really not giving this project the merit that it's due, but in view of your time schedule, Mr. Chairman, and the fact that we have the support of the Alderman and the Plan Commission, I will surrender our time and we are available to answer questions. Again, I do not take for granted the approval by this committee, but I wanted to expedite our review in view of your time constraints.

[Speaker 1] (4:15:06 - 4:16:05)
Thank you, we do have a letter of support from Alderman Coleman. Questions, comments from committee members? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call to determine quorum?

Alderman Dowell makes that motion. Any objections to her motion? Hearing none, the records are, this is passed as revised, I'm sorry.

All right. Thank you very much. We're down to the bottom of page 14, document number 20995, Third Ward.

Ordinance was referred on April 27th of 22. Common address is 301 through 313 East 43rd Street and 4301 through 4313 South Prairie. Change requests from B23, Neighborhood Mixed-Use District and RM5, Residential Multi-Unit District, all to a B35 Community Shopping District, then to a Plan Development.

Steve Friedland.

[Speaker 25] (4:16:06 - 4:16:41)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman. Steve Friedland with Applegate and Thorne Thompson here on behalf of the joint venture between the Habitat Company and P3 Markets for this project. You can move to the next slide, please.

This is a proposed 80 unit transit serve location development at the corner of 43rd Street and Prairie. We appeared before the Chicago Plan Commission last week on the 15th of September. And at this time, I would request that you incorporate the findings and record of the Plan Commission.

[Speaker 1] (4:16:43 - 4:16:55)
Vice-Chair Ravois moves to incorporate the records for the Plan Commission by the same roll call that was used to determine form. Any objections? Hearing none, the records are incorporated.

Continue, Steve.

[Speaker 25] (4:16:56 - 4:18:35)
Thank you. As I stated, this is a joint venture between the Habitat Company and P3 Markets. This is the second phase of their development in this corridor of 43rd Street.

The first phase is currently under construction. This phase, as I stated, is 80 units, 44 of which will be affordable housing. If you go to the next slide, just to give you a sense of the, well, maybe one more.

There should be a site plan. Here we go. There will be a retail along 43rd Street, much needed in this corridor.

And there will be a residential entrance along Prairie, along with 13 parking spaces at the rear of the property. Go to the next slide. This is maybe the best way to show you what this process has brought about.

And I would say much of this at the behest of Alderman Dow, who's really spearheaded this, to bring this to the community. On your left, you see phase one, which is undergoing construction right now, a 10-story building. On your right is the phase two development that we're asking for approval right now.

And together, these are on either side of the green line to really create some commercial and residential space in this location. With that, I understand your timeframes, Mr. Chairman. I do have members of our development team available, but we would certainly be willing to answer any questions you might have.

[Speaker 4] (4:18:41 - 4:18:44)
I think you're on mute, Mr. Chairman. All right.

[Speaker 1] (4:18:47 - 4:18:54)
This is the twin property, if I'm not mistaken, that we've approved already with the same group, I believe, almost.

[Speaker 25] (4:18:55 - 4:19:03)
Correct, correct. The same joint venture did phase one or is in the process of completing phase one, and this is phase two.

[Speaker 1] (4:19:03 - 4:19:06)
All right, so Alderman Dow.

[Speaker 25] (4:19:08 - 4:19:09)
Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 8] (4:19:09 - 4:19:34)
In the essence of time, I would ask for the committee's approval of this transit-oriented project. It's a transit development project adjacent to the 43rd Street Green Line stop. Phase one is under construction.

Phase two is what we're looking at today, and our community is extremely excited about this development because of the housing and also because it's bringing new retail to the corridor. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (4:19:35 - 4:19:38)
Thank you, Alderman. Questions for the applicant?

[Speaker 8] (4:19:38 - 4:19:44)
Oh, I just want to thank P3 Markets and Habitat and Steve. Thank you.

[Speaker 4] (4:19:45 - 4:19:47)
All right. All right.

[Speaker 1] (4:19:49 - 4:20:14)
Thank you, Alderman. So I need a motion to- Alderman Riley moves to pass. Oh, wait, what are you doing?

Okay, so Alderman Riley makes the motion to move to pass on this item by the same roll call as you to determine form. Any objections? None.

Hearing none, this item is passed as revised. All right.

[Speaker 25] (4:20:14 - 4:20:16)
Thank you very much. Hold on.

[Speaker 4] (4:20:59 - 4:21:00)
You're muted, Chairman.

[Speaker 47] (4:21:12 - 4:21:12)
All right, let's go.

[Speaker 4] (4:21:13 - 4:21:19)
Would I have you for one last housekeeping item? This item on page 16 needs to be deferred, so we got to make a motion to defer it.

[Speaker 1] (4:21:20 - 4:22:00)
All right. So we're just straight out of here. Okay, we're going to go out of order just to defer this item in the 11th Ward, document number 21103, 11th Ward, ordinance is referred on July 20th of 2022.

Common address is 3316 through 18 South Morgan. And I would ask for a motion to defer this item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Alderman Riley still moves.

Any objections? Hearing none, the item is deferred on that one, on Morgan.

[Speaker 47] (4:22:17 - 4:22:18)
You're muted.

[Speaker 4] (4:22:45 - 4:22:51)
All right. So the rest, the other items on the agenda have already been deferred.

[Speaker 1] (4:22:51 - 4:23:12)
And so that completes the agenda for today. However, we are going to recess until 9.30 tomorrow morning. We are going to reconsider an item at the request of the Alderman.

Any questions? Which item is that, Chairman?

[Speaker 46] (4:23:13 - 4:23:13)
Yeah.

[Speaker 1] (4:23:14 - 4:23:18)
It is in the combined 25th and 28th Ward.

[Speaker 13] (4:23:20 - 4:23:26)
Sorry, Chairman, this Alderman had me stepped away for a moment. So we're reconsidering the item that we voted down.

[Speaker 1] (4:23:28 - 4:23:38)
Tomorrow, we're recessing, number one, we're recessing. And we'll reconvene tomorrow at 9.30 and we answered the question properly, I think.

[Speaker 13] (4:23:39 - 4:23:39)
Gotcha.

[Speaker 1] (4:23:39 - 4:23:41)
You answered your own question.

[Speaker 13] (4:23:41 - 4:23:45)
Yeah, I didn't know we could do that. Thank you. Learn something new every day.

[Speaker 1] (4:23:45 - 4:23:49)
I told you. Mr. Chairman? That is Alderman Beal.

[Speaker 10] (4:23:51 - 4:24:02)
Mr. Chairman, isn't it typical of our rules and reg that anytime a item is voted down, that it is referred out as being voted down from the committee?

[Speaker 1] (4:24:06 - 4:24:17)
We can discuss this tomorrow morning at 9.30 when we reconvene the committee hearing. So now I need a motion to adjourn. Oh, I'm sorry.

[Speaker 32] (4:24:18 - 4:24:18)
Motion to recess.

[Speaker 1] (4:24:19 - 4:24:33)
Okay. I need a motion to recess till 9.30 tomorrow morning. Alderman Wagesbeck makes the motion to recess until 9.30 tomorrow morning. Any objections?

[Speaker 4] (4:24:35 - 4:24:40)
Okay, thank you. We'll see you tomorrow morning, 9.30. Sorry for the inconvenience. Bye-bye.
