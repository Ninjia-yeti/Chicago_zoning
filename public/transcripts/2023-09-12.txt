We have four public speakers signed up for today's hearing, and we will hear from them now. And first up, we have Mr. George Blakemore.

[Speaker 38] (12:51 - 12:56)
Good morning to the citizens of the city of Chicago.

[Speaker 7] (12:57 - 15:53)
I'm not new here, but the game remains the same. Zoning, where you can bill and not bill, where you can open up business and not open up business. But if something egregious that happens in the zoning board and the zoning committee, it's pay to play.

What? Pay to play. If you have an irregular lot and it's not zoned for a certain type of business or building on it, you can still bill on that lot, whatever you want, when you want.

If you have money, that's the big issue, pay to play. And it's something wrong here. Let me make a suggestion with your zoning.

Just don't only look at a letter from Ultima, whoa, whoa. See if the community has been involved when they meet. Televise it, have it televised.

How many community members voted for this item? How many of them was against this item? When did this meeting take place?

And you know these zoning lawyers are part of this scheme too. If you have these prestigious zoning lawyers and you pay them, you can get what you want, when you want, and how you want. So this is why it's very, very important to have citizen participation.

This is a one-party thing. We need multi-party, y'all need to be checked. We need the Democrats, we need the Republicans, we need several parties.

Because what's going on here with this one party? Democratic machine is corrupt, fraud, and abuse. And that's why we need citizens like Mr. Blakemore to show up, to call out. But you don't listen. Whatever's down here to be zoned will be zoned. They have had previous meetings.

Have you ever heard of anything they call, and maybe it's not political correct, but I'm going to say that 69. Oh, he said that. Yes, a six and a nine.

[Speaker 1] (15:54 - 16:04)
Thank you so much, Mr. Blakemore. Next up, we have Michael Mintle, who is from the Chicago Cook County Building Trades, and he's here to speak in favor of Fifth Third Arena.

[Speaker 33] (16:07 - 16:57)
Good morning, members of the committee, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Michael Mintle. I'm the Secretary-Treasurer of the Chicago Cook County Building Trades Council.

I am here today speaking in support of the Chicago Blackhawks Fifth Third Arena expansion. In 2017, when Fifth Third Arena opened, it created over 250 construction jobs. The expansion is expected to create 260 union construction jobs and 50 permanent jobs.

Like 2017, this project will include a local hiring initiative, outreach and training programs. The $65 million expansion is a privately funded investment in a community. The expansion will be on land that is now vacant just west of the current building.

At a time when Chicago and other big cities are still recovering from the pandemic, this project would be an economic development boost for the west side and for Chicago. We are proud to work with the Chicago Blackhawks and look forward to putting more Chicagoans to work through this project. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (16:58 - 17:06)
Thank you so much. Next, we have Zachary Brown, who is here to speak in favor of 3327 North Lincoln.

[Speaker 26] (17:07 - 18:43)
Hi, yes, my name is Zach Brown. This is my first time speaking here, so bear with me. But yes, I want to talk about the development, Set to Replace Dinkles Bakery at 332 North 7 North Lincoln Avenue.

I just want to say my wife and I are strongly in favor of this development. We think it would be great for the neighborhood. We're first time homeowners.

We just bought a house in June. We just moved into the neighborhood. We're on the 1700 block of West Henderson by Gross Park.

So I mean, we're literally like less than two blocks from where Dinkles Bakery was. It's probably like a three minute walk door to door. And I want to say we're really excited to be first time homeowners.

We're renting before this. We had this plan. We wanted to get a house and then a puppy and a baby.

So we got the house. We're getting the dog next week. Maybe the baby in the next year or two.

We'll see. But when we were thinking about buying a house, we could have moved out to the suburbs. But one of the reasons we wanted to be in the city is we wanted to be somewhere with life and energy and people, somewhere that had thriving businesses and stores and restaurants.

And so I think this development could be really great for the neighborhood. I don't want to live somewhere where there's all these old buildings everywhere. I like new stuff.

I like new construction. I think that's how a city stays alive and stays energized. And I believe from what I've read, there's also going to be at least nine affordable units in the building, which I think is great.

I want this neighborhood to be welcoming to all sorts of people because it's a great neighborhood. And hopefully we can be welcoming. And I'm excited to meet any new neighbors who might move into that place.

[Speaker 1] (18:44 - 18:52)
Thank you. Thank you so much. And next we have Charles Anderson, who is here to speak in favor of the Fifth Third Arena.

[Speaker 14] (18:53 - 21:00)
So good morning, everyone. My name is Charles Anderson. I am the proud principal of Michelle Clark.

For those that don't know, it's right off of 290 in Laramie. And I'm here to stand for this because of the work that we've done with Fifth Third Arena and Michelle Clark and the Blackhearts. One of the things that I will tell you, as a growing up student on the west side, there always felt like there were boundaries for us.

So there was times I remember as a kid, we just didn't go on one side of Western because we never knew what we weren't supposed to, basically. And as a principal, I wanted my kids to be exposed to every opportunity there is in Chicago. And so when we got a chance to collaborate with the Blackhearts, it was an amazing time.

What we've done, back to school events. We've had kids go and learn to ice skate. But one of the proudest moments for me is that we've also had kids learn about jobs that are part of hockey.

And so many times they think that they don't have those opportunities. And so the expansion that this will do for my students and not just my students, but the west side as a whole to continue opening up for other schools as well. I think it's phenomenal.

I think it's a great move. And I wanted to stand as a principal who has seen great things happen. They've been very collaborative with us.

We've worked with Joe Fresh Goods, opening stores inside the school. I see some of you guys nodding, so you know that we've been doing some work. And this work is not something that you can do by yourself.

This is work that you have to do with partners to help you become better, not for yourself, but for your community and your students. And so today I wanted to stand and say I support this expansion because I know what it can do for our students, especially I'm speaking from the west side. I didn't grow up on the south side, so I can't speak for all of them.

But I'm excited about the avenues that it opens for our students to be able to move beyond just barriers, invisible barriers that stop them from being as successful as they want to be. So thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (21:01 - 22:02)
Thank you so much. That now completes public comment. I'd like to note that Alderman Beal has joined us, as has Alderman La Spada.

And we're also joined by former Alderwoman Helen Schiller of the 46th Ward. Hi, Helen. All right.

We will start off today with the addendum to the agenda. The first item is Mayoral Introduction Document Number Ordinance 2023-0002910, the Amendment of Municipal Code Chapters 1372, 17-10, 17-13, and 17-17 regarding electric vehicle supply equipment. The item has a substitute.

All members of the committee should have received a copy of the substitute, as well as a summary electronically. At this time, I would ask for a motion to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Alderman Villegas motions to accept the substitute.

Are there any objections? Hearing none, the substitute is before us. We have Commissioner Matt Bidet of the buildings department here to give us a presentation on this ordinance.

Commissioner?

[Speaker 2] (22:05 - 26:06)
Chairman Romero-Rosa and members of the committee on zoning landmarks and building standards. My name is Matt Bidet and I'm the Commissioner for the Department of Buildings and great to be back here in person testifying with me today as Managing Commissioner, Deputy Commissioner Grant Albrecht and also joining us is Deputy Chief Sustainability Officer, Jared Palachikio. I'm here today to ask for your favor of consideration for Mayor Johnson and Alderman Martin's ordinance enhancing the city's electrical vehicle or EV readiness ordinance.

I believe you received a copy of this substitute and the summary of the sections. As you recall, the city council passed an EV readiness ordinance in April of 2020 that required all new construction of residential buildings with five or more units and onsite parking and commercial properties with 30 or more parking spaces to have at least 20% of any supplied parking spaces, electrical vehicle supply equipment ready. Doesn't mean it's in there.

It just means it's got to be ready for it for when it comes. Additionally, all applicable properties had to have at least one EVSE ready space for people with disabilities. In June of 2023, the state enacted public law 103-0053 which sets statewide requirements for EV readiness for new and renovated residential buildings.

The proposed ordinance will ensure that the state requirements seamlessly combined with our existing city EV readiness. To provide a few highlights of the amendments. First, the proposed ordinance will apply to new state requirements to building permits applicable applications submitted on or after November 1st, 2023.

We want to give folks time to be able to put this into their plans and their financing. So we allow a lot more efficient and phase compliance for Chicago homeowners and property owners. Second, the proposed ordinance integrates the new state requirements into the existing city sections already requiring EV readiness in certain Chicago buildings.

While the existing city requirements are more stringent in terms of the level of EV charging readiness required, they do not currently apply to all residential buildings. The new state requirements apply to all single family homes and multifamily residents, but only require the base level of EV charging, and that's for new construction or major renovation. So you and I don't have to convert our homes right now to be EV ready.

We obviously have that opportunity, but it's not required under state law or city law currently. Third, the proposed ordinance will allow buildings that qualify as affordable housing under state statutes to document eligibility of the affordable housing specific standards through the zoning administrative adjustment process. To streamline permitting, the number of discrete administrative adjustments that can be approved per project without having to go before the Zoning Board of Appeals or the ZBA is being increased from two to four.

Fourth, the substitute amendment clarifies the technical language used to describe energy management systems, a type of equipment that balances distribution of power to several EV chargers, allowing for more efficient electrical design and clarifies language to certain definitions related to EVs in the city zoning ordinance. With proposed ordinance, we will both ensure that building owners and developers can comply with understandable and organized requirements. At the same time, continue to advance the availability of EV charging infrastructure to Chicago residents.

This is an essential part of Mayor Johnson's larger effort to combat climate change. Thank you for your time and I ask for your favorable consideration and I'm happy to answer any questions. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (26:06 - 26:22)
Thank you so much, Commissioner. At this time, I'd like to recognize that we have two non-committee members with us. We have Alderman Lopez, as well as Alderman Matt Martin and Alderman Martin is a sponsor alongside the mayor of this item, so if there are no objections, I'd like to turn the floor over to Alderman Martin to speak on this item as well.

[Speaker 12] (26:24 - 28:37)
Thank you, Chairman, and good morning, colleagues. A few things that I wanted to add to what Commissioner Boudet shared was that, as many of you will recall in early 2020, this body passed a resolution declaring a climate crisis in Chicago and this was itself on the heels of Chicago and over 50 other cities across the world pledging to reduce carbon emissions in line with the Paris Agreement. So this is very much in line with what we've been committing to do over the last number of years.

As Commissioner Boudet mentioned, we followed up that climate declaration by passing an ordinance introduced by Alderman Riley that strengthened requirements for EV charging infrastructure in new residential and commercial buildings. We've also seen since then that car companies across the U.S. and beyond have committed to selling only electric-powered vehicles within the next 10 to 15 years, so I think it's incumbent upon the city to build out the infrastructure that will support those vehicles and that part of that infrastructure needs to be tailored to supporting people beyond single-family homeowners who are currently the vast majority of people who are driving new and used electric vehicles. And I think it's also important to note that in addition to just keeping pace with where the auto industry is going, this is about responding to the ongoing climate crisis responsibly given the fact that the transportation sector is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions nationally at about 28% of all emissions and here in Chicago, it's just a little bit less than that at 24%. Lastly, note that in the last term, I'd introduced a right to charge legislation that ultimately the state beat us to the punch in passing, but that we're still here making some changes and strengthening what we'll be complying with at the state level.

So thank you, Chairman, for being amenable to putting this on the agenda. Thank you, Commissioner Grant, Jared, CSO Tovar for your collaboration and hope we can have this committee's favorable support. Thank you.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (28:37 - 28:41)
Are there questions or comments from committee members? Alderman LaSpada.

[Speaker 4] (28:41 - 29:16)
Thank you, Chairman. I'm just curious, number one, very supportive of the ordinance, the work that we're doing here. Certainly as Alderman Martin talked about, we cannot hope to address climate change in any meaningful way unless we're moving towards electrification where our vehicles are concerned.

I was curious if we've been able to do any kind of evaluation on the success of the 2020 ordinance in terms of generating EV readiness in terms of the developments that are being created.

[Speaker 11] (29:18 - 29:19)
How has that worked out?

[Speaker 2] (29:23 - 29:46)
That's a great question, Alderman. We don't have any specific numbers, but again, the requirements that went in in 2020, so all the new buildings that have been built with five or more units have to have EV readiness there. And then of course, as Alderman Martin has stated, people have been doing this on their own as well that have electrical vehicles.

I think my wife says our next car is going to be electrical, so I'm going to have to upgrade my system myself.

[Speaker 4] (29:47 - 30:11)
I hope the same thing is true in my household as well. I think I would encourage the city to think at some point about how in what neighborhoods new construction and renovations tend to be concentrated and to think about how do we make sure EV readiness is equitably distributed across the city, but that is a conversation for another day. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 11] (30:12 - 30:14)
Thank you, Alderman LaSpada. Alderman Villegas.

[Speaker 38] (30:17 - 30:19)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 9] (30:22 - 31:26)
I support this ordinance and I'm looking forward to the city actually trying to monetize where we can have actual EV chargers on the streets and allowing for the city to benefit from it. But when we talk about climate change and that this is going to help reduce it, I'm a little confused because, I mean, we're still utilizing fossil fuels in order to create electricity. So I think at some point we'll get to where we're utilizing wind and solar and all these other modes to create the electricity, but right now we're still utilizing pretty majority fossil fuels in order to create electricity.

So I think that when we're talking about this, I think that we're taking those steps, but I think that it's a little optimistic to talk about that we're going to be affecting the climate change right now. I think that this is a long-term goal. What are the steps, Department of Building, what are you guys doing?

Are you working in collaboration with CDOT to figure out how to monetize the EV chargers on public waste?

[Speaker 11] (31:30 - 31:31)
Yes, Alderman, that's a great question as well.

[Speaker 2] (31:32 - 32:57)
We are working as a team. So we work with CDOT, we work with Zoning Administrator Patrick Murphy because what I've seen is a lot of the folks that want to come in and put EV chargers in the community, they're being treated as a gas station basically as far as from zoning perspective. So again, that's something we need to address because that brings in zoning changes, special uses and everything else associated with that.

So yeah, it is a time for us to rethink the way that we've been doing things. Our code needs to be updated. That's why we keep bringing code amendments to this council and a commitment to updating our codes because it's more than just the building code or the zoning code or CDOT.

There's a lot of moving parts here that need to be changed and we are working together to do that. And we are seeing an increase in solar panels. I got them myself this summer.

So we're seeing a combination of items moving away from fossil fuels and to more sustainable energy. And of course, with the Chief Sustainable Officer and her staff too, we're all working collaboratively to try to find ways to be more sustainable and have our code be more sustainable and more user-friendly and more affordable so that folks can take advantage of sustainable energy.

[Speaker 9] (32:58 - 33:14)
Thank you. Do we have a timeframe on that? New York's already has charges out there and monetizing it.

Do we have a timeframe? Because as we're talking about revenue, this would be a perfect opportunity. And this is not novel.

I mean, there's other large cities doing it. Do we have a timeframe on when you think we'll get there?

[Speaker 2] (33:14 - 34:04)
I do not have that information. Do you need an ordinance to do it or is this something that you think? I think there may be some ordinance changes down the line, especially if we're looking at EV charging stations different than we are looking at gas stations and again, trying to fit a new technology into the existing codes.

That's why we've been making some changes and in the building code and the EV was in the zoning code as well. And one of your colleagues from the Deputy Chief Sustainable Officer may be able to add some more about how we're collaborating because his CSO's Talbot shop is really running the collaboration in a good way.

[Speaker 24] (34:04 - 35:38)
Yeah, thanks commissioner. Thanks Alderman. Great question.

Jared Pellicicchio, I'm the Deputy CSO representing the CSO's office. I can give you two details on timeline and how we're working on public charging in addition to the work that the commissioners talked about for developments and zoning. One is we're seeking federal funding.

There's a lot of federal funding in the infrastructure law for municipalities and states to build out a charging network. And so we actually submitted an application with CDOT in May for up to $15 million in funding for public charging. We're waiting to hear right now from USDOT but we're pretty hopeful.

We had a pretty strong application. So that's one thing. And then the other thing that's going on that CDOT is driving is they are well underway now on what they're calling their EV framework analysis.

So they're doing a comprehensive analysis with an outside consultant that's gonna include community engagement, engineering analysis, a whole sort of suite of things to really figure out how to get public charging in the public way right. That is underway now. There's different phases to it.

But I think early next year they will begin to have results of that. And I'm sure they plan to talk with this committee and other committees about the findings and how we can actually drive this forward. So hopefully that gives you a sense of two things that are underway.

[Speaker 1] (35:39 - 35:40)
Thank you. Thank you.

[Speaker 30] (35:40 - 35:41)
Thank you, chairman.

[Speaker 1] (35:41 - 35:43)
Thank you so much. Alderman Conway.

[Speaker 30] (35:44 - 36:38)
My question's for commissioner but would certainly open it up to anyone that has thoughts on it. So I am blessed to represent a ward that has one of the three or four top new development wards in the city. And I'm very proud of that in a city that is struggling with a consistent housing shortage today.

I also was a solar energy developer before joining city council and constantly get questions about EV charging infrastructure and when we're gonna have more of it. So my question is for new development of five or more units, what will this require above and beyond just conforming to the new state law? Is this gonna require something else beyond that?

[Speaker 2] (36:41 - 37:45)
I don't believe it. And we're already new construction of five or more units already has to have 20% EV ready. Including an accessibility EV ready space.

So this is not changing anything for the larger five or more units. They already have to comply with the city code which is a little bit more stricter when it comes to what type of EV readiness has to be there. And from what we see the development community is doing this on their own.

Even if it may be four units they know that the people moving in there are looking for EV charging stations. They're looking for solar. They're looking for greater electrification of their buildings.

So the industry itself is responding to the marketplace and doing a lot of this work on itself. But to our credit, to Alderman Riley's credit, to Alderman Martin and other members of the chambers we wanna make sure that we have to actually have this as part of our code so that development all across the city benefits from this.

[Speaker 30] (37:46 - 37:52)
Wonderful. Thank you, commissioner. And Mr. Chairman, I'm proud to support this. And Alderman Martin, thanks for bringing this to committee.

[Speaker 1] (37:53 - 38:10)
Thank you so much. I would like to recognize that Alderwoman Fuentes and Alderwoman Cruz have joined us for the quorum. Are there any more questions or comments on this matter?

Any more from committee members? All right, hearing none we will go to a non-committee member, Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 5] (38:12 - 38:52)
Thank you, chairman. And good morning members of the zoning committee. Public, it's nice to be back here for once.

I have a question with regards to section 17.13.10.03 on page four with regards to the administrative adjustment reducing the number of spaces for construction deemed as affordable housing. Is there a particular reason why affordable housing units would have need for less opportunity for electric vehicles than any other development?

[Speaker 11] (38:57 - 39:04)
I'll ask deputy commissioner Grant Albrecht or managing deputy commissioner Grant Albrecht who worked with the state and the city on this.

[Speaker 36] (39:05 - 39:27)
Good morning. Grant Albrecht, managing deputy commissioner, department of buildings. Thank you for the question, Alderman.

This is mirroring the provisions in the public act. So we are implementing those provisions from state law into the municipal code. We're taking that definition of affordable housing from state law, which is different than anything in our code and giving them that option to comply with the same requirements as everywhere else.

[Speaker 5] (39:28 - 40:46)
So just so I'm clear. So simply because the state says affordable housing should have less we're agreeing with affordable housing should have less. Because I would imagine chairman that oftentimes I've heard many people in this body and many people in this administration talk about the environmental justice needs of neighborhoods particularly under-invested disinvested neighborhoods where we oftentimes put a lot of affordable housing where we talk about air quality and things of that nature.

And it would just seem to be somewhat contradictory in nature to say that what we are supporting for the future somehow does not have to have the same amount of availability for affordable housing as though individuals who would reside in affordable housing would not have an electric vehicle as well. So is there anything that would prevent this body or this council from not mirroring state law and going beyond it and ensuring that all developments that are residential multi-unit regardless of affordability status are required to have the same number of stations regardless where they are or what their construction purpose was.

[Speaker 36] (40:46 - 41:05)
No, I don't believe so Alderman. So we drafted it this way for now. The public act passed and was signed and goes into effect fairly quickly.

So we wanted to align with at least the minimum the state law is increasing us to but that's certainly something the council or others could bring back and increase that requirement.

[Speaker 5] (41:06 - 41:07)
Okay, thank you.

[Speaker 1] (41:09 - 43:36)
All right. Well, if there are no more questions or comments by committee members do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderman LaSpada motions do pass.

Are there any objections? Hearing none. The ordinance is passed as substituted.

Thank you so much commissioner. All right, moving on. We have two historical landmark fee waivers.

I will read them together and take one motion. The first is in the fourth ward for the property commonly known as 4543 South Ellis. And the second is in the 43rd ward for the property commonly known as 1618 North Cleveland Avenue.

We have the support of Alders Robinson and Knudson who both introduced the matters. We also have Michelle Rimes from the historical landmark division of the department of planning development here to answer any questions committee members may have. Are there any questions?

If there are none, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderwoman Harris moves do pass. Are there any objections?

Hearing none, the waivers are passed. Thank you so much. All right, last up on the addendum are large signs over 100 square feet in area, 24 feet above grade.

We will hear the signs together and take one motion for all at the end. I will read the ward followed by the address, noting that to be legal, all signs must comply with all provisions of title 17 of the Chicago municipal code and all other provisions of the municipal code governing the permitting, construction, maintenance and removal of signs and sign structures. Failure of the applicant and the applicant's successors to comply shall be grounds for invalidation or revocation of the sign permit.

In the 11th ward, 4000 South Racine Avenue. In the 11th ward, 23238 West Cermak Road. In the 13th ward, 6400 South Pulaski Road.

Four signs on the 21st ward, located at 221 West 83rd Street. In the 22nd ward, 3960 West 26th Street. In the 23rd ward, 6084 South Archer Avenue.

In the 27th ward, 1443 North Ogden Street. Three signs in the 32nd ward, located at 2196 North Elston Avenue. One sign in the 32nd ward, located at 1745 West Fullerton Avenue.

Three signs in the 35th ward, located at 3350 West Diversity. One sign in the 46th ward, located at 4840 North Marine Drive. Lastly, two signs in the 47th ward, located at 3819 Northwestern Avenue.

If there are no questions by committee members, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderwoman Fuentes moves do pass. Are there any objections?

Oh.

[Speaker 11] (43:37 - 43:51)
Alderman Beal. 738 West Fullerton. 7738 West Fullerton.

All right, thank you so much for catching that, Mr. Alderman Beal.

[Speaker 1] (43:53 - 44:59)
In the 27th ward, 2738 West Fullerton Street. Thank you so much. All right, are there any other questions or comments by committee members?

Okay, so Alderwoman Fuentes renews her motion do pass with the addition of the additional item in the 27th ward. Are there any objections? Hearing none, the orders are passed.

We will now move on to the regular agenda. In an effort to ensure the committee meeting runs as smoothly as possible, the typical order in which items will be heard has been updated. Items will be grouped together according to witness and will be heard in that order rather than ward order.

We will be starting with the third item on page seven. That's number 21192 in the 30th ward. Common address 3817 North Hamlin Avenue.

This is an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to RT3.5 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district. And we have Esquire Lisa Duarte here for this item.

[Speaker 31] (45:00 - 45:55)
Thank you, Chairman. Good morning. For the record, my name is Lisa Duarte.

I'm an attorney from a point of different strategies. Here we have a zoning amendment for 3817 North Hamlin Avenue. The property is currently zoned as an RS3 residential unit detached house district.

We're pursuing a change to an RT3.5 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district. The property currently has a two story, two dwelling unit building on it with a basement. The owners Bernice and Ricardo Lozada wish to convert the basement into a third owner occupied dwelling unit.

The current owner resides across the alley at 3830 North Joy Avenue, and they wish to move into the new unit with their family. There's an existing two car garage and a third space is proposed. And we have a letter of support from the 30th Ward Alderperson.

[Speaker 1] (45:56 - 46:30)
Excellent. Are there any questions? If none, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

Alderwoman Cruz moves do pass. Are there any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Thank you so much. Okay. We are moving back to page one.

Okay. And these are three items in the 18th Ward submitted by Alderman Derek Curtis. And do we have Vernon Wills from the 18th Ward present?

Thank you so much.

[Speaker 11] (46:30 - 46:40)
Please come on up, Mr. Wills. All right. So we will hear these items together.

[Speaker 1] (46:40 - 47:42)
It is number A-8826 at 3245 to 3321 West Columbus Avenue. This is an M1-1 Limited Manufacturing District, C1-1 Neighborhood Commercial District, and RT4 Residential Two Flat Townhouse and Multi-Unit District to a T Transportation District. This is number A-8827th, Common Address 3323 to 3745 West Columbus Avenue.

And this is an M1-1 Limited Manufacturing District, C1-1 Neighborhood Commercial District, and RT4 Residential Two Flat Townhouse and Multi-Unit District to M2-1 Light Industry District. And lastly, number A-8828 at 8658 South Pulaski Road, 3841 to 3987 West Columbus Avenue. And this is an M1-1 Limited Manufacturing District and C2-1 Motor Vehicle Related District to M2-1 Light Industry District.

All three items were submitted by Alderman Derek Curtis, and we have Mr. Vernon Wills from his office here to testify, Mr. Wills. Good morning.

[Speaker 35] (47:45 - 48:05)
Go ahead. Yes, basically Alderman, his plan is to basically have a variety for all of the additional businesses to attract businesses to the area, basically. That's what he, that's why he's doing a rezone.

[Speaker 1] (48:06 - 48:14)
Thank you so much. Are there any questions from committee members? All right, hearing no questions, Alderman Beal.

[Speaker 15] (48:14 - 48:20)
Okay, these are three automatic zoning changes, correct? Correct, yeah. So is it for development or?

[Speaker 35] (48:22 - 48:32)
It's for expansion, basically. It's for expansion for interest in other businesses in the area and flexibility for the existing businesses.

[Speaker 11] (48:32 - 48:34)
Okay, is this private property?

[Speaker 35] (48:36 - 48:38)
Yes, they're all private property.

[Speaker 15] (48:38 - 48:46)
Okay, so why wouldn't this be a zoning change introduced by council and not an automatic zoning change?

[Speaker 11] (48:50 - 48:54)
So we do have our Zoning Administrator Patrick Murphy here who can also answer some of those questions.

[Speaker 17] (48:55 - 49:56)
Sure, thank you, Chairman. Alderman, so we worked with Alderman Curtis a number of months ago. There was a business along the stretch of the road that was not in compliance from a zoning standpoint.

So we offered to go out and review multiple blocks of this area to see what might bring the existing businesses into conformance. So these different chunks of map amendments are designed to legalize A, a business that was there and was in violation and then other businesses up and down the street. So it was done in conjunction with his office to legalize some of the existing conditions.

Okay, but it looks like it's for an expansion. I don't recall if the business that was in violation was physically expanding. They may have been, but when we looked at the whole area, we wanted to look beyond just the one business.

So we looked at the whole range of these various addresses. There were a few, the reason it's in blocks as opposed to one contiguous section is there are some residential areas of residential construction that do exist. And we wanted to skip around those.

[Speaker 15] (49:57 - 50:06)
Okay, so are there any businesses or residents along this corridor that would seek to benefit from this being in compliance?

[Speaker 17] (50:08 - 50:36)
So there are a few businesses, I don't have the list here with me that would no longer be non-conforming. So they would be established legally. Okay, that's not my question.

What I was also going to add is there were no residential properties that were impacted or reduced and there were no additional development rights given to someone beyond what already exists for their properties. So we limited the map amendment to legalize those that exist to get them out of some manufacturing zoning and still allow for their outdoor operations to take place.

[Speaker 15] (50:37 - 50:49)
Okay, let me be extremely specific. Are there any businesses looking to, in the future, benefit from this zoning change being in compliance?

[Speaker 17] (50:50 - 50:56)
I do not know of any businesses that were, that had any ambitions to do anything related to these zoning districts, no.

[Speaker 15] (50:56 - 51:05)
Okay, well, let me ask the applicant, well, it's not Alderman, the Alderman is the applicant, but you're a resident, is that what I'm hearing?

[Speaker 35] (51:05 - 51:06)
Yes.

[Speaker 15] (51:06 - 51:13)
Okay, are you personally looking to expand, change your business or whatever that will help this being?

[Speaker 35] (51:13 - 51:22)
I am not personally looking to expand. It's basically the Alderman is doing it for opportunities for other businesses to expand if need be.

[Speaker 15] (51:24 - 51:27)
So it's for future land plan usage, is that what I'm hearing?

[Speaker 35] (51:27 - 51:27)
Yes.

[Speaker 15] (51:27 - 51:29)
Okay, thank you.

[Speaker 1] (51:29 - 51:37)
Thank you so much. And for the record, Mr. Wills is a staffer for Alderman Curtis. All right, are there any more questions?

Alderman LaSpada.

[Speaker 4] (51:39 - 51:47)
I assume it's fair to assume that the property owners have been notified of these zoning changes and are supportive?

[Speaker 1] (51:49 - 52:14)
Yes, so when an aldermanic application is submitted, our wonderful competent staff here do a title search and then a mailing is sent per law as required to everyone within 250 feet to notify them of the aldermanic zoning map amendment, as well as the postings that are done on the actual properties and the street themselves.

[Speaker 4] (52:15 - 52:19)
And did they respond in support?

[Speaker 1] (52:19 - 52:21)
We have had, the committee has received no objections.

[Speaker 4] (52:22 - 52:24)
Okay, cool, thank you.

[Speaker 1] (52:24 - 53:40)
All right, any more questions or comments on this matter? If not, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderman LaSpada moves do pass.

Are there any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed. Thank you so much.

Yay. Okay, moving on to page two. This is number 228 in the 44th Ward.

This is 3519 to 49 North Clark Street, 1001 to 1029 West Addison Street, 3546 to 58 North Sheffield Avenue. And this is a residential business plan development number 1164 as amended to residential business plan development 1164 as amended. We need to incorporate some records.

So the item was heard and passed by the Chicago Planning Commission. Can I have a motion to incorporate all records and findings from the hearing by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderman Lawson so moves.

Are there any objections? Hearing none, the records are incorporated. At this time, we will hear from attorney John George and Chris Leach.

[Speaker 13] (53:41 - 55:49)
Thank you. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee zoning landmarks and building standards. My name is Chris Leach.

I'm an attorney with the offices located at 71 South Wacker Drive. I'm appearing this morning on behalf of the applicant Addison and Clark property owner LLC in connection with the technical amendment to residential business plan development number 1164. Subject property is located in the 44th Ward is located just South of Wrigley Field and is generally bound by Addison Street on the North Sheffield Avenue on the East and Clark Street on the West.

Thank you for incorporating the proceedings from the plan commission. PD 1164 was originally approved in 2010 and then amended in 2017, providing for a mixed use development consisting of an eight story building, 108 feet in height, approximately 170,000 square feet of commercial space, 148 dwelling units and 493 on-site parking spaces. The proposed technical amendment would increase the FAR of the PD from 3.76 to 3.87, which is still well within the five FAR allowed under the underlying zoning district. The additional FAR is being requested to make interior modifications to add mezzanine levels and to allow the existing commercial spaces to be fully built out requiring additional FAR. The proposed technical amendment makes no changes to the exterior or to the existing envelope of the building as previously approved by the Chicago City Council on June 28th, 2017. The applicant has received a letter of support from Alderman Lawson, but I'll let him speak for himself.

And then on behalf of the applicant, Jason Alt, the applicant's representative that's here with me today, I would like to thank Alderman Lawson and staff of DPD for their work on this project, particularly Thomas Bellino. And we stand ready to answer any questions that you may have and ask for your favorable recommendation. Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (55:49 - 55:55)
Thank you so much. Other questions from members? Alderman Lawson.

[Speaker 23] (55:56 - 56:34)
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I just wanted to echo my support here. Obviously, everyone knows exactly where this is in my ward.

And given the timing, PD was approved in 2017. It's had some ups and downs with our market and with the commercial space, especially. It's in a really good place.

So to offer some flexibility there for the commercial users, there's a movie theater, there's a gym, there's Luck. It's the bowling alley games place. So I don't wanna get wrong.

Lucky Strike, it is Lucky Strike. Harley Davidson dealership. If you haven't been over, it's gonna be fun, I think, in the next couple of weeks.

So my full support. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (56:35 - 57:25)
Any other questions or comments from committee members? All right. Hearing none, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

Alderman Lawson moves do pass. Are there any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Thank you very much. Thank you so much. Okay, we're moving on to the second item on page two.

This is number 22113 in the 44th ward at 2828 North Clark Street. This is a plan development number 139 to plan development number 139 as amended. We have attorney Nicholas Vatikas and we're gonna incorporate some records.

So this item was heard and passed by the Chicago Planning Commission. Do I have a motion to incorporate all records and findings from that hearing by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderman Dow also moves.

Are there any objections? Hearing none, the records are incorporated. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 21] (57:26 - 58:29)
My name is Nick Vatikas again for the record. I'm here on behalf of the applicant and property owner BAI Century LLC. The subject property at 2828 North Clark Street is better known as a Century City Shopping Center.

We are seeking to amend the plan development to clarify the allowed commercial uses within the plan development as well as to redefine the liquor license restrictions. This plan development was originally established as best we could tell in 1976 and it limited the number of retail uses to, I'm sorry, the number of liquor licenses to one per every 22,000 square feet within the PD as well as making it only incidental to restaurants. So the proposed changes would broaden that to allow incidental liquor licensing to uses that are not just a restaurant.

And again, we specify the allowed uses under today's code. So it really just modernized the 1976 ordinance. No changes are proposed to the building.

It's a use-based amendment. And with that, I'd be happy to answer any questions you or the committee members have.

[Speaker 1] (58:30 - 59:06)
Questions or comments from committee members? All right. If there are no questions or comments, I hear motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Alderman Lawson moves do pass. Are there any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed as revised.

Thank you so much. All right. Now we're moving on to number 22216 in the 36th Ward.

This is 1551 to 1553 North Costner Avenue. This is an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to C2-1 motor vehicle related district. Mr. Fatikas.

[Speaker 21] (59:06 - 59:51)
Thank you again, Chairman. For the record, Nick Fatikas from the Law Offices of Sandbanks. I am here on behalf of the applicant and property owner, Tim Sanchez.

We are seeking a zoning change to bring an existing garage that was built at the front of the property in the full compliance with the ordinance. The issue is that the property is zoned RS3. So the garage, when it formerly functioned, accessory to a vehicle repair shop was nonconforming.

We have worked with Alderman Villegas' office and we've committed to assuming we're able to secure the zoning change and ultimately permits to bring the garage into compliance. We would agree to down zone the property back to the RS3 to keep a consistent zoning map at that corner of Costner. Again, we did participate in a community meeting and I believe we have the Alderman's support to proceed today.

[Speaker 1] (59:52 - 1:00:32)
We have heard from Alderman Villegas. He has indicated his support. Are there any questions or comments from committee members?

All right. Hearing none. Do I hear motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

Alderman Villegas moves do pass. Are there any objections? Hearing none.

The item is passed. Thank you, sir. Moving on to page three, number 22230 in the 43rd Ward.

This is 2246 North Clark Street. This is a B1-3 Neighborhood Shopping District to a B2-3 Neighborhood Mixed Use District. And we have Attorney Sarah Barnes here to speak on this item.

[Speaker 25] (1:00:36 - 1:02:07)
Thank you. Good morning, Mr. Chairman and esteemed members of the committee. For the record, my name is Sarah Barnes and I'm an attorney with the lobsters of Sam Banks.

I'm happy to be here this morning on behalf of the applicant 2246 Clark, LLC, which is solely owned and managed by John Bantorf and his wife who are both residents of this neighborhood. We are here today seeking a zoning map amendment in order to permit the rehabilitation and renovation of the existing three-story with basement mixed use building at the subject site. The zoning amendment will allow for the Bantorfs to convert the existing and vacant first floor commercial space to a new residential unit, as well as to build out the currently unused basement into another independent dwelling unit for a total of four rental units at the property.

We have worked with Alderman Timmy Knudson who is here today, as well as the Mid-North Neighborhood Association and Francis Parker School with regard to this proposal. And I do believe that we have the support of all such community liaisons at this time. And perhaps Alderman Knudson could provide some more color to this if he so pleases.

[Speaker 1] (1:02:09 - 1:02:10)
Alderman Knudson.

[Speaker 34] (1:02:10 - 1:02:58)
Is this thing on? Yeah, okay, thank you, Sarah. Yeah, so we're in support here, whereas we typically oppose first floor residential in areas that have commercial.

This is a really unique pocket across from the Francis Parker School and the commercial there struggled because of the layout of the building. Therefore, we find it a good way to get a couple new rental units into the ward. The couple that is developing this building, they also live one block away and we're excited about that closeness and vicinity and really their desire to keep this in its preserved form as they do the project.

Got through our Mid-North Neighborhood Association that has a major focus on preservation and so we're all fans.

[Speaker 1] (1:03:00 - 1:03:15)
Wonderful, thank you so much. Are there any questions or comments from committee members? If not, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

Alderman Knudson moves to pass. Are there any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

[Speaker 25] (1:03:15 - 1:03:16)
Thank you so much.

[Speaker 1] (1:03:16 - 1:03:53)
Thank you so much. All right, we're moving on to number 22233 in the 39th ward. This is 3218 to 22 West Bryn Mawr Avenue.

This is a B1-2 Neighborhood Shopping District to B3-2 Community Shopping District and we have attorney Mark Kupiec. Before I turn it over to him, I do want to note that we have been joined by Alderman Mosley for the quorum. So welcome Alderman Mosley.

All right, so we have attorney Mark Kupiec for number 22233 at 3218 to 22 West Bryn Mawr Avenue.

[Speaker 6] (1:03:54 - 1:05:14)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My name is Mark Kupiec. I'm the attorney for the applicant, Office of the 77 West Washington, 3218-22 West Bryn Mawr.

I have with me John and Wendy Wynn and we also have Sam Margarino somewhere, our architect. And John and Wendy currently operate a restaurant in the building on the subject property. I've operated that restaurant for a few years.

Like many restaurants had difficulty with the pandemic and after the pandemic survived with carry outs and some difficulty getting the customers back into the restaurant. Similar restaurants in that area have had some success by adding karaoke music. So the plan is to add karaoke music.

In order to do that, they would need a PPA license and we were advised to, in order to get that PPA license, we'd have to rezone it from B1 to a B3 and that's what we are proposing. At the Alderman's request, we appeared before the local community group, actually met with them on two occasions and they were nice enough to give a letter of support that they sent to the Alderman, Alderman Nugent and I believe that she also sent a letter of support and we would ask for your favorable recommendation.

[Speaker 1] (1:05:15 - 1:05:29)
We have heard from Alderwoman Nugent and she is in support. Are there any questions or comments from committee members? I have a question.

Will these be individual small group karaoke rooms or will this be like a large karaoke venue?

[Speaker 6] (1:05:31 - 1:05:33)
You got to talk into the microphone. John, state your name for the record.

[Speaker 1] (1:05:33 - 1:07:03)
We have five room in the space. There'll be five rooms and your name for the record. My name is John Nugent.

Thank you so much. Well, I look forward to visiting this karaoke spot. You're welcome.

Are there any other questions or comments from members? All right, hearing none. Is there a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

Alderwoman Fuentes moves do pass. Are there any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you.

Okay, the next item will be deferred. This is number 22238-T1 in the 27th Ward, 1153 West Grand Avenue. And if there are no questions by committee members, Vice Chair Lawson makes a motion to defer the previously read item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Are there any objections? Hearing none, the item is deferred. All right, moving on to number 22237-T1 in the 11th Ward.

This is 500 to 510 West Pershing Road. And this is an M1-2 limited manufacturing business park district to RT-4 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district. We do have substitute narrative and plans.

So Alderwoman Ramirez moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Are there any objections? Hearing none, the substitute narrative and plans are accepted and before us.

And we have attorney Mark Kupiak.

[Speaker 6] (1:07:04 - 1:07:22)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My name is Mark Kupiak. I'm the attorney for the applicant.

The applicant is Bill Barborough, who's present and seated beside me. I'd like to point out there is a typo on the agenda with respect to the spelling of Bill's last name. Although I think we have it correct on our application, but it is William Barborough.

[Speaker 11] (1:07:23 - 1:07:24)
Thank you.

[Speaker 6] (1:07:24 - 1:08:20)
Subject property is zoned manufacturing. And last use was some type of manufacturing use. The reality is that most of this property north of Pershing is residential.

So actually this zoning change from manufacturing to residential is more in keeping with the surrounding neighborhood north of Pershing. The proposal is to build a 12 townhouse development. We had taken this to the older woman.

She had asked for a community meeting. We did a community meeting, large meeting with mailed notice, both in person and also available via Zoom, answering the questions with the meeting. Actually, a few small corrections to the plan after that meeting.

And that's the substitute narrative. And with that, followed up with the Alderman to ask for her support. And I believe she sent you a letter.

[Speaker 1] (1:08:22 - 1:08:45)
We have heard from Alderwoman Lee and she is in support. Are there any questions by committee members? Hearing none, is there a roll call?

Do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderman LaSpada moves do pass. Are there any objections?

Hearing none, the item is passed with the substitute narrative and plans.

[Speaker 6] (1:08:46 - 1:08:47)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:08:47 - 1:09:24)
Okay. So moving on now to number 22168-T1. This is at 1754 North Palina Street in the 32nd Ward.

And this is M1-1 Limited Manufacturing Business Park District to B1-1 Neighborhood Shopping District. And we have Attorney Mark Kupiak. We also have substitute narrative and plans.

So Alderwoman Ramirez moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type 1 application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Are there any objections? Hearing none, the substitute narrative and plans are accepted.

And before us, Attorney Kupiak.

[Speaker 6] (1:09:24 - 1:10:49)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My name is Mark Kupiak, Office of 77 West Washington. Represent the applicant.

And I have with me on behalf of the applicant, Una Luton, who's seated beside me. And our subject properties already improved with an old, old industrial building. Sits actually right next to the 606 Trail.

The reality is that most of these old industrial buildings along that corridor have already been converted to residential. So there are not much manufacturing use left. Una and her business operates, currently operates daycare centers in the city of Chicago.

She's an experienced operator. And the plan is the adaptive reuse of the existing building, changing the zoning from the M district to a B district to allow daycare center as a permitted use. We've worked with the Alderman staff with respect to this application and our plans.

At the request of the Alderman, we did appear before the Bucktown Community Organization, BCO. They had a meeting with them. They had some questions, submitted our plans, tweaked the plans a little bit after that meeting.

And that's your substitute plan. That's before you. And after the support of the BCO, followed up with the Alderman and his staff.

And I believe that you have a letter of support from the Alderman. We ask for your recommendation.

[Speaker 1] (1:10:51 - 1:11:36)
We have heard from Alderman Wagaspak. He is in support. Are there any questions or comments by committee members?

Seeing none. Is there a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderman Villegas moves do pass.

Are there any objections? Hearing none. The item is passed.

Thank you so much. All right. The next items are represented by Attorney Steven Friedland.

Starting with number 22232 in the 20th Ward. This is 6300 to 6308 South Cottage Grove and 747 to 759 East 63rd Street. And this is for a B3-3 Community Shopping District to B3-5 Community Shopping District.

Attorney Friedland.

[Speaker 3] (1:11:37 - 1:13:06)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman. My name is Steve Friedland with the law firm of Applegate and Thorne Thompson. Here on behalf of DL3 Realty Advisors with me today is Alex Sparhawk, who's the Director of Acquisitions and Development for DL3.

This is a request to rezone the old Washington National Bank building at 63rd and Cottage Grove. The rezoning request is to go from a B3-3 to a B3-5. That will permit the redevelopment of the existing building into a new six-story building.

Currently, the Washington National Bank building is four stories. Some of the elements of the facade will be saved and applied upon, incorporated into the new building. This will be new commercial and office development, just right adjacent to the green line at this location.

The property is currently owned by the Cook County Land Bank. The land bank put on RFP for this property to see it redevelop. That process went also through the Department of Planning and Development, who have vetted the project, and also the ward.

There have been public meetings and discussions with respect to the project. I believe that the committee has a letter from Alderman Taylor in support. And with that, we'd be happy to take any questions you might have.

[Speaker 1] (1:13:06 - 1:13:13)
We have heard from Alderwoman Taylor. She is in support. Are there any questions or comments by committee members?

Alderman LaSpada.

[Speaker 4] (1:13:14 - 1:13:24)
Thank you. I am just curious how y'all are making use of the TOD and ETOD provisions that are put forward in the city code as part of the development.

[Speaker 32] (1:13:24 - 1:13:53)
Yeah, it's actually... My name is Alex Sparhawk, Director of Acquisitions Development. We are very supportive of the ETOD program.

That's incredibly beneficial. This property sits adjacent to the green line CTA. And because it's a zero lot line building, we really have to have minimal amount of parking just because of the constraints of the existing building and keeping the facade.

So taking advantage of that program has been incredibly beneficial.

[Speaker 4] (1:13:54 - 1:14:06)
Brilliant. I mean, knowing... Applicant Thorne-Thompson, y'all tend to be engaged in developments that are mixed use to 100% affordable.

Can I ask about the affordability in the development?

[Speaker 32] (1:14:07 - 1:14:29)
So there's no residential in this property. It is only commercial. That was a result of the community planning process devised by Cook County Land Bank Authority.

It was overwhelmingly requested by community members to see commercial uses, non-profit uses, building amenities or services and amenities for residents of the neighborhood.

[Speaker 4] (1:14:29 - 1:14:38)
Only commercial? Yes. That's very interesting.

We'll mull that over in my head, but no other questions for right now. Thank you, Chair.

[Speaker 1] (1:14:39 - 1:15:41)
Thank you so much. Are there any more questions or comments from committee members? All right.

Do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderman Sanchez-Lopez moves do pass. Are there any objections?

Hearing none, the item is passed. Okay, moving on to number 22090 in the 25th Ward. This is 2134 to 2146 South Ashland Avenue, 1601 to 1629 West 21st Place.

This is an M1-1 Limited Manufacturing Business Park District to B2-3 Neighborhood Mixed-Use District and then to a planned development. We need to incorporate some records. So this was heard before the Chicago Planning Committee and passed by the Planning Commission.

Could I have a motion to incorporate all records and findings from that hearing by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderman Sanchez-Lopez so moves. Are there any objections?

Hearing none, the records are incorporated. And we are hearing from Mr. Steve Friedland.

[Speaker 3] (1:15:42 - 1:18:24)
Good morning again. My name is Steve Friedland with the law firm of Applegate and Thorne-Thompson here on behalf of the Resurrection Project for this site. With me today is Wakolda Reyes who is with the Resurrection Project and our project architect, Gabrielle Jakiewicz is also here.

As you can see above, the site in question is at 21st and Ashland directly across from Benito Juarez High School. As you probably know, the Resurrection Project has been developing in Pilsen and surrounding areas for 30 years. This project is another one of their 100% affordable developments.

It will provide, as you see here, 98 units of affordable housing, first floor community space. The project, if you go to the next site, you can see this is the look of the building from Ashland Avenue. And it meets the street, as you can see.

And then the next slide you'll see is a picture or a rendering of the development along 21st Street. Go one more, I think. Yeah, here, just so you can see the parking on site, it comes off of 21st Street.

As I said, the building meets Ashland Avenue and it will provide, as I indicated, if you go to the next slide, all of the units in the building will be tax credit affordable units. And there are varying levels of affordability within the building. So we are really trying to provide housing for a number of different affordable levels.

In the next slide, this is just a slide showing the real public benefits, which we showed to the plan commission and we're very pleased that we received their unanimous approval. The project will meet the city's participation goals for minority and women-owned businesses and hiring of Chicago residents. And it will be a significant investment into the Pilsen neighborhood with over $60 million of investment through the project.

With that, we'd be happy to take any questions you might have.

[Speaker 11] (1:18:26 - 1:18:27)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (1:18:27 - 1:18:33)
Do we have questions or comments from committee members? Alderman Sanchez-Lopez.

[Speaker 19] (1:18:34 - 1:20:28)
Thank you. Thank you, chairman. And thank you to the members of the zoning committee.

This is, I'm really proud to support this important affordable housing project in the 25th Ward in Pilsen. This is a reflection of a lot of community feedback. As you can see, some of the units go as low as 15% AMI, which is almost unheard of nowadays.

And I think that the efforts to make our units truly affordable, I think that the mix that you see reflects the needs of our community. You know, 60 plus of the units are two or three bedrooms or family size units that are really needed to repopulate or schools to repopulate or neighborhood that lost 14,000 residents, almost entirely Mexican American. So these are efforts that I think all our community is proud of.

I'm grateful for the resurrection project to incorporate many of the, many of the, or some of the community feedback regarding that. And I think that this is in line with our quality of life plan that plan a thousand units of affordable housing in the first term. And I really, really, and we are almost there.

I think with 18th and Peoria and this incredible project, I think that we do justice to a community that has been advocating for affordability and hopefully set a precedent. So I want to thank and commend the resurrection project. I know that we've been working diligently to assure low affordability rates and our commitment to continue helping, making sure that they secure the funding.

So I appreciate the support of this committee to ensure our committee continues to build affordable housing in the 25th ward and beyond. Thank you, chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:20:28 - 1:20:30)
Thank you so much. Alderman LaSpada.

[Speaker 4] (1:20:31 - 1:21:56)
Thank you, chair. I just want to speak in favor of this as well, particularly having gotten to see the presentation previously at the plan commission. We talk a lot about affordable housing and that can feel like a nebulous term.

And the proof of the value of this is as everything that Alderman Citillo has just said, it's in the fine print. It's in the font size eight up here. But the fact that, like you said, 15 to 30% affordable, like area median income for the folks who are actually working as our shop clerks, like the folks who are doing the hard daily work in our neighborhoods to be able to afford good homes for the family sizes that we're talking about.

It was a long season in this city that we were being told the only thing anyone's looking for is one and two bedrooms. To see someone actual doing a substantial number of three bedroom affordable units, that's a hard thing to do. And I know everyone here has been told a lot about affordable housing finance.

That's a hard thing to do. And to do that in a building that is so beautiful, that is so well landscaped, that in the way you're doing, parking and sighting encourages people to pursue healthy forms of mobility and transportation as well. A lot of kudos because I'm sure there's a ton of hard work that got us to this moment right here today.

So thank you so much. Thank you, Chair.

[Speaker 1] (1:21:57 - 1:21:59)
Any other questions or comments from committee members?

[Speaker 11] (1:22:01 - 1:22:02)
Alderman Ramirez.

[Speaker 37] (1:22:04 - 1:22:20)
Thank you. Congratulations. Did you just say a thousand units within your first year?

That is absolutely incredible. I did have a question. 21st and Ashland, is that currently land that's not being used or are you guys demolishing something that's already existing?

[Speaker 3] (1:22:20 - 1:22:32)
Yeah, Alderman, the land is currently vacant. It has been vacant for some time and it has been zoned manufacturing for a long time. So it's really been unused.

[Speaker 37] (1:22:33 - 1:22:36)
Okay, great. Well, congratulations, Alderman Byron Sigcho-Lopez. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:22:38 - 1:24:02)
That's tremendous. I mean, I just want to note that this was zoned manufacturing right across the street from a high school and now we're going to have family size units, affordable units, and hopefully Benito Juarez high school students will be able to live there. So are there any more questions or comments from committee members?

All right. Hearing none, Alderman Sigcho-Lopez moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Are there any objections?

Hearing none, the item is passed as revised. Thank you so much. Okay, moving right along to number 20374 in the 15th Ward.

This is 1701 to 1725 West 61st Street, 6100 to 6158 South Paulina Street, 1700 to 1724 West 67th Street, and 6101 to 6159 South Hermitage Avenue. This is an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to RT3.5 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district. Then to a plan development and we need to incorporate some records.

So the item was heard and passed by the Chicago Planning Commission. Is there a motion to incorporate all records and findings from the hearing by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderman Lawson so moves.

Are there any objections? Hearing none, the records are incorporated and we have Attorney Steve Friedland here to speak on this item.

[Speaker 3] (1:24:02 - 1:26:54)
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. My name is Steve Friedland from the law firm of Applegate and Thorne Thompson. Here on behalf of Gorman & Company, who's proposing a redevelopment of the Earl School with me today is Ron Kluwer who's with Gorman.

This is one of the city schools that closed over a decade ago and the proposal is to redevelop the most of the existing school buildings into 50 units of affordable housing. All 50 units will be tax credit affordable units. If you go to the next slides, you can just see these are really old beautiful buildings that existed and they're going to be repurposed as residential.

If you go one more slide, I think maybe one more after that. I want to get to the site plan, which is here we go. So this is a full block of land and the balance of the block, the West portion of the block is being reserved as a separate sub area where the expectation is up to 25 units of townhome development could go onto that site after they finish phase one, which is to your right.

One of the existing school buildings will actually be torn down. It's just not really able to be redeveloped, but the 50 units of affordable housing will go into those sets of buildings that you see on the screen. Go to the next slide, please, Nicole.

There we go. So this just gives you again a breakdown of the affordability of the units. And this is also a project where there is a variety of levels of affordability from 60% AMI all the way down to 15% AMI.

Go to the next slide. This again just shows you what we did present to the plan commission was our belief that this really provides a great benefit for the community. It reuses a school that has been closed for a long time and was obviously the hub of a neighborhood.

The developer will meet all of the city participation goals and it will create jobs and provide great investment for the community. I know that Alderman Lopez is here. I'm sure we'll speak to this, but this is a project that has been gone through community process for quite a bit of time.

And we're very excited that it's moving forward. With that, we would accept any questions the committee might have.

[Speaker 11] (1:26:56 - 1:27:00)
Alderman Villegas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 9] (1:27:01 - 1:27:06)
So this property comes back on the tax roll. Correct. Do we know what that number is?

Number looks like.

[Speaker 28] (1:27:09 - 1:27:22)
I don't at the moment because of the newer Cook County tax rule. We're waiting for the assessor to determine the final value, but like an approximation, it's gonna be in excess of $60,000 a year.

[Speaker 9] (1:27:22 - 1:27:23)
Thank you.

[Speaker 28] (1:27:23 - 1:27:25)
And your name and title for the record?

[Speaker 1] (1:27:25 - 1:27:37)
Ron Kluwer, Illinois Market President. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The questions or comments from committee members?

Okay, we have heard. Oh, Alderman LaSpada.

[Speaker 4] (1:27:37 - 1:28:10)
Thank you, Chairman. To be clear, supported the development when it was in the plan commission. I supported today.

I also feel like whenever y'all take the time to print out someone's concerns that we take a moment to address them as well. To either yourselves or to Alderman Lopez, the concern that is brought apparently before us in this letter is why the 1973 property is unfit for adaptive reuse and slated for demolition. Could you just speak again into why we're seeing that for the project?

[Speaker 28] (1:28:12 - 1:29:08)
Absolutely. Ron Kluwer again, Illinois Market President. So it's the 1971 building that we're removing.

No worries. It's the modular building that was added to expand classrooms. The actual construction of the building, while it is concrete piers on the exterior shell, in between there, it's all just metal panels.

It is structurally reasonably sound, but because of the design of the building itself, it makes it difficult to put the units in. And once we attempted that, those units were the highest cost per unit on the project, which actually deemed it then infeasible. And so we went back to remove that building.

So instead we could continue with the project at 50 units and then hopefully work with the Alderman, the community to design the second phase of that project.

[Speaker 11] (1:29:12 - 1:29:13)
Other questions or comments?

[Speaker 1] (1:29:14 - 1:29:19)
We have heard from Alderman Lopez who has indicated his support. Alderman Lopez, would you like to add anything?

[Speaker 5] (1:29:21 - 1:31:21)
Thank you, Chairman and members of the committee. I want to thank our presenters and thank Ron for sticking through with this project. This project actually began, excuse me, I believe in early 2020, if not even before then, because I remember we were trying to, at that time, learn how to do a community meeting through Zoom, a technology none of us knew how to operate well.

And despite many of the other projects that began pre-pandemic, we survived this because as my good friend and colleague, Gil Villegas likes to say, time kills deals. And I think this one, we came damn near close a few times, but it has survived. This is not just a housing development.

This is going to be an iconic repurposing of a historic building in a historic neighborhood in the city of Chicago's South side that not only will provide housing, but will provide amenities that deals both with the supportive services of its residents, as well as welcomes the community into its doors. We have been very excited from the get-go to move forward with this project. And knowing that it's a culmination of both tax subsidy using TIF for some of the surrounding infrastructure and street improvements that we need to do and engaging in workforce development and opportunities for local residents of the West Englewood community, not just restricted to the 15th Ward, but the West Englewood community, I think is a model for how in communities that are split amongst wards that we can show we can work together. And I fully support this, have fully supported this and look forward to seeing this come to fruition at long last and ask for everyone's favorable consideration on this matter. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:31:22 - 1:31:57)
Thank you so much. All right, if there are no more questions or comments, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderman LaSpada moves do pass.

Are there any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed as revised. Thank you very much.

Thank you. Okay, moving on to number 22234 in the 11th Ward. This is 2739 South Shields Avenue.

This is RS3 residential single unit detached house district to RT4 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district. This is Gordon. We have attorney Gordon and Pekarski.

[Speaker 29] (1:31:58 - 1:33:09)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. Thank you for inviting me to discuss this project with you today. I am Tom Pekarski of the law from Gordon and Pekarski and I'm here on behalf of the applicant.

We got Mike Kuh. We're before you seeking an amendment of the city of Chicago zoning map from the current RS3 to that of an RT2 for the property commonly known as 2739 South Shields Avenue. The subject site is currently vacant and it's a lot measuring 26 by 124 feet.

It used to be improved with a two unit building, two unit residential building. The applicant proposes to construct one building containing three residential units. Two of the units will be eventually occupied by the applicant's family members.

We have reviewed our plans with Alderman Lee and appeared before an extensive community process. No objections have been voiced to the proposal and the Alderman Lee has issued her support of the project in the form of a letter that was previously provided to the chairman. Therefore, we ask the committee to vote its recommendation of passage of the application to the full city council.

[Speaker 1] (1:33:11 - 1:33:56)
We have heard from Alderman Lee. She is in support. Are there any questions or comments from committee members?

Hearing none, do I hear a motion to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderman LaSpada moves to pass. Are there any objections?

Hearing none, the item is passed. Thank you. Thank you so much.

All right, we're moving on to number 22236-T1 in the first ward. This is 1342 West Ohio Street and this is an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to B2-3 neighborhood mixed use district. We do have substitute narrative and plans.

So vice chair Lawson moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Are there any objections? Hearing none, the substitute narrative and plans are accepted and we have attorney Rolando Acosta here to speak on this item.

[Speaker 22] (1:33:57 - 1:34:47)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman. Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant. This property is currently vacant.

It's a standard Chicago city lot. It was purchased by the applicant and they originally proposed to build a single family home on the property. After discussing this with Alderman LaSpada and the community, it was desired that we do a multifamily building.

This is across the street from Rauner College Prep. As a result, the applicant modified his plans to have designed a six unit building, three parking spaces. The property is transit served location and that is the proposal before you.

For that purpose, we are seeking to rezone the property from the RS3 to the B23 district. Alderman LaSpada has provided a letter, but I also acknowledge that he is here and may want to speak. Happy to answer any questions the committee may have.

[Speaker 1] (1:34:48 - 1:34:52)
We do. Are there any questions or comments? Alderman LaSpada.

[Speaker 4] (1:34:52 - 1:35:33)
I will speak. I really appreciate Mr. Acosta's client being so willing to work with us on this. Recognizing, particularly in that area of Westtown, how much housing has been lost.

A willingness to think about this missing middle concept between the PD and the single family home. So many housing types that we're losing and need to find really affordable and sustainable ways to replicate. The six flat is a great fit for the neighborhood.

I just was really impressed by their representation and their willingness to collaborate with our office on this. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:35:33 - 1:36:33)
Wonderful. Thank you so much. Are there any questions or comments by committee members?

All right. Hearing none, Alderman LaSpada moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum with the substitute narrative and plans. All right.

Hearing no objections, the item is passed with the substitute narrative and plans. Okay. We got nine more items on the agenda, you all.

Okay. So number 22170-T1 in the 15th Ward. This is 2614 West 48th Street and 4743 South Tolman Avenue.

This is an M1-2 Limited Manufacturing Business Park District to C3-2 Commercial Manufacturing and Employment District. We need to incorporate some plans. So this item was heard and passed by the Chicago Planning Commission.

Can I have a motion to incorporate all records and findings from the hearing by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderwoman Fuentes so moves. Are there any objections?

Hearing none, the records are incorporated and we have attorney Rolando Acosta here to speak on this item.

[Speaker 22] (1:36:33 - 1:37:28)
Good morning again, Mr. Chairman. Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant. The applicant purchased this building.

It's a 27,000 square foot building. It's lot line to lot line, lot being about 27,000 square feet also. It was long vacant.

I had a slew of building code violations. They wanted to repair this building and turn the front of it approximately 15,000 square feet into a coffee roaster and cafe, which is their business. They have secured actually permits for that.

The rear 12,000 square feet is essentially a big empty space. They propose to use about 4,800 square feet of that for a venue. It is that that is motivating the rezoning from the M1-2 to the C3-2 District.

This was an industrial corridor and the visit to the planning commission which unanimous recommended approval for this. We have the support of the alderman, but he is also here in case he wishes to speak. We are happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (1:37:29 - 1:38:48)
All right. Are there any questions or comments from committee members? We have heard from Alderman Lopez.

He is in support of this item. There are no questions or comments. Do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

Alderwoman Clay moves do pass. Are there any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed as revised.

Thank you so much. Thank you. Have a good day.

Okay. Number 22203 in the 33rd Ward. This is a common address 3701 to 3759 West Leland Avenue, 4647 to 4659 North Avenue, 4600 to 4658 North Lawndale Avenue, 4601 to 4611 North Lawndale Avenue, 3700 to 3718 West Wilson Avenue, and 3646 to 3656 West Wilson Avenue.

This is a plan development 878 to plan development 878 as amended. And we need to incorporate some records. So this item was heard and passed by the Chicago Plan Commission.

Can I have a motion to incorporate all records and findings from that hearing by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderman LaSpada so moves. Are there any objections?

Hearing none, the items are incorporated. And we have Attorney Scott Borsten here to speak on this item. Yes, Alderman Beall.

[Speaker 15] (1:38:49 - 1:39:18)
Thank you, Chairman. I was trying to get your attention before we even got to this item. I was just wondering, you know, I submitted a zoning change back in May.

And I received an email from your office stating that that zoning change would not be heard unless I gave you a phone call. It was a routine zoning change. And I was just wondering, I've been hearing from some of my other colleagues as well, that, you know, I guess there's a new policy that people have to call you before an item is placed on the agenda.

Is that correct?

[Speaker 1] (1:39:19 - 1:39:57)
So when there's an aldermanic involved, there is a title search that must be conducted. And in addition to a title search, there's also the cost of the mailing that comes out of the committee budget. And so this policy is a carryover from prior zoning chairs, where we just want to be able to talk to you to have a sense of what it is that you're trying to accomplish.

It's not uncommon for an alderman to submit an aldermanic zoning map amendment and then decide that they don't want to move forward. And so before the committee incurs the cost of both the title search and the cost of the mailing, which can be in the thousands of dollars, we do ask that you do reach out to me so that we can discuss what it is that you're trying to achieve and the timeline that you're seeking to achieve that in.

[Speaker 15] (1:39:57 - 1:40:08)
Okay. And so when I wrote a support letter on April 26th of this year, that support letter had nothing to do with as far as my support for zoning change?

[Speaker 1] (1:40:09 - 1:40:27)
So I have spoken with colleagues who have submitted aldermanic map amendments and then they've said, actually, I don't want to move forward with this at this time. So that's the conversation that we need to have is just what it is that you're trying to achieve, the timeline that you're trying to achieve it in. So we can then take that into account in terms of our budget and our own scheduling for these items.

[Speaker 15] (1:40:27 - 1:40:45)
Okay, but Mr. Chairman, if I submit a zoning change and I submit a support letter, there's two inclinations that I support the zoning change and to have, you know, again, I'm speaking to quite a few of my colleagues and they're saying that you're requesting a phone call that almost seems like you're asking people to kiss the ring to have something put on the agenda.

[Speaker 1] (1:40:46 - 1:40:56)
No, that's not the intention. It's just a conversation to discuss scheduling and timing. So the same way that we're discussing it right now, you could have given me a call.

Instead, you've taken everyone else's time here.

[Speaker 15] (1:40:56 - 1:41:04)
I get that as well, but you know, my phone rings too. And you could have called me to see what my agenda was. Absolutely.

[Speaker 1] (1:41:04 - 1:41:15)
So we can discuss this matter later. Gladly. Excellent.

All right. So moving on, we have attorney Scott Borstein to speak on number 22203 in the 33rd ward.

[Speaker 16] (1:41:16 - 1:42:34)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. Scott Borstein from the law offices of Neal and Leroy here on behalf of Chicago Public Schools. Thank you for adopting the records of the plan commission for this matter, right?

This is a plan development, an amendment to a plan development for North River Elementary School and Aspera Haugen Middle School, which are co-located in one building. The general address is 3729 West Leland. This whole project simply relates to the school wanting to install a dynamic image sign on West Leland Avenue.

And that use was not a strictly permitted use under the PD. And so the department of planning said they thought it was best to amend the existing PD in order to allow the sign. But that is the only change that is being made.

And I've got Evan Smith from the director of planning of Chicago Public Schools here with me and Sarah Floyd, our project architect. And Sarah can quickly go through. I think there's only three slides or four slides if you want, or you're seeing them now.

So whatever works best with you, but that's all this case is about. And so we're here to answer any questions.

[Speaker 11] (1:42:37 - 1:42:40)
Well, they've been lost. Is this off premise signage?

[Speaker 23] (1:42:40 - 1:42:41)
Is it advertising signage?

[Speaker 16] (1:42:41 - 1:42:46)
No, on premise signage, strictly related to school activities.

[Speaker 23] (1:42:47 - 1:42:58)
So I'm just curious why you had to go through the PD amendment process for just the change of the type of signage. Patrick is going to answer it for you. Thank you.

[Speaker 17] (1:42:59 - 1:43:23)
Yes, Patrick Murphy from the department of planning. It's because the zoning district that preceded the establishment of the PD did not allow for this type of sign. So normally we would not have to take a sign, a sign only through a PD process or an amendment.

But in this case, the preceding zoning district didn't allow the type of signage that they wanted. So we had to go to a business zoning district in order for them to go ahead and proceed with this permit.

[Speaker 16] (1:43:24 - 1:44:05)
Right, and just to add a little more clarification, currently the rule in the zoning ordinance is that when you're in an R district, you are not allowed to do the dynamic image display sign unless it's a through street. And Leland Avenue is not a through street. So the only way to change it, you can't change whether it's a through street or not.

We had to go through the PD process and then change the underlying zoning to a B district in order to do the sign. So we are going to be working with the city to be addressing signage for CPS schools because there's a lot of schools that do want these dynamic image display signs. So hopefully we won't have to go through the PD process each time.

[Speaker 23] (1:44:05 - 1:44:10)
That's exactly why I asked. I think every school probably wants this or has this no matter where they are. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:44:12 - 1:44:33)
Are there any more questions or comments from committee members? All right, hearing none, is there a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? You're calling for a roll call on this item?

Okay, so Alderman Beal is calling for a roll call on this item. So we will take the roll.

[Speaker 11] (1:44:35 - 1:45:46)
Vice Chair Lawson. No. Alderman LaSpada.

Alderman Hopkins. Alderwoman Dowell. Alderman Hall.

Alderwoman Harris. Alderman Beal. Alderman Beal, you're in the room.

You have to vote. No. Nay, okay.

Alderwoman Ramirez. Alderman Moore. Alderman Mosley.

Alderman Sigcho Lopez. Alderwoman Fuentes. Alderman Burnett.

Alderwoman Cruz. Alderman Conway. All right, Alderman Villegas.

Alderman Riley. Alderman Knudson. Alderwoman Clay.

All right, all right. Alderman Ramirez votes aye. That's nine yays, one nay.

The item carries and we have a quorum. Okay, the quorum is 10.

[Speaker 1] (1:45:47 - 1:46:46)
All right, thank you so much. The item passes. Thank you so much.

So we are now moving on to number 21192 in the 30th ward. This is 3817 North Hamlin Avenue. This is RS3 residential single unit detached house district to RT3.5. My apologies, this item passed already. So we're moving on to the next item on page eight, number 22173 in the 28th ward. This is 4711 West Chicago Avenue. This is an M1-1 limited manufacturing business park district to M2-1 light industry district.

And this has been amended to a T1. So Alderman LaSpada moves to amend the application to a type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Are there any objections?

Hearing none, the item is amended to a type one application. And we have attorney Lawrence Lusk here to speak on this item.

[Speaker 27] (1:46:48 - 1:48:02)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My name is Lawrence Lusk. I'm the attorney representing the applicant in this matter, DGOLLC, which is the current owner of the property located at 4711 West Chicago Avenue.

Sitting to my right today is Jeanette Ramos. She is the managing member of the applicant, and she's prepared to answer any questions the committee may have. This application requests a change from the current zoning classification of M1-1 to M2-1.

The property is currently vacant land. The applicant intends to use the existing vacant lot for outdoor vehicle storage, specifically the overnight parking of eight to ten midsize moving trucks. The applicant operates a furniture moving company and seeks to move their vehicles to a location on the west side of Chicago in order to be closer to their current employees' residences.

We have met with Alderman Jason Irving, and we have amended our application to the type one application, as you indicated, at the alderman's request. And Alderman Irving has indicated his support for this zoning map amendment. I believe that he's transmitted a letter of his support, but we have a copy of that letter if the committee needs that.

We are not aware of any objectors to this project, and therefore the applicant respectfully requests your approval in this matter. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:48:02 - 1:48:23)
We're available for any questions. Thank you so much. We have heard from Alderman Irving, and he is in support of this item.

Are there any questions or comments? All right. If there are no questions or comments, I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Alderman Puentes moves do pass. Are there any objections? All right.

Hearing none, the item passes. Thank you so much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 27] (1:48:23 - 1:48:27)
I'd like to note my case was the quickest so far today, and I'd just like a little credit for that.

[Speaker 1] (1:48:27 - 1:49:08)
We appreciate that. Okay. We have five more items.

Let's do this. So this is number 22206 in the 27th Ward. This is 301 South Damon Avenue.

This is 1800 to 1853 West Jackson Boulevard. And this is plan development number 1309 and plan development 1310 to C2-5 Neighborhood Commercial District, and then to Residential Business Industrial Plan Development 1309. And we're going to incorporate some records.

So this item was heard and passed by the Chicago Planning Commission. Do I have a motion to incorporate all records and findings from the hearing by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderman Villegas so moves.

Are there any objections? Hearing none, the records are incorporated. And we have Attorney Donna Pugh here.

[Speaker 10] (1:49:09 - 1:51:31)
Thank you so much. I'm going to try to beat that record. Good morning, Donna Pugh, Foley and Lardner on behalf of 1851 Land LLC.

I'm joined by Sarah Guderian, who serves as Chicago Blackhawks Vice President of Social Impact Outreach and Civic Affairs, and also President of the Blackhawks Foundation. She's here to answer any questions about the community benefits, which are numerous. Also, our project architect, Tom Prebstal with Generator Studios.

So as you know, this is an amendment to combine PDs 1309 and 1310, and to change the zoning from B33 and C15 to C25. Now the parcel for expansion will be acquired from Rush Medical Center, hopefully any day now. The Blackhawks held a community meeting in April, and the Planning Commission unanimously approved the matter in August.

We have a letter of support from the Malcolm X College, which we've submitted, although we have more copies if you need that. There's a real close synergy between Malcolm X College and this facility, because there's lots of students there and they're hungry, not a lot of places to eat. And we're opening up our food service and everything, including seating areas to anyone in the community.

So I know people are very happy about that. Of course, we're committed to the M and WBE participation goals of 26 and 6, city residency of 50%. And the group always works closely with the aldermen on those initiatives.

Finally, just a couple things. The Blackhawks are really committed community partners on the West Side, welcoming Chicago Public School students, Boys and Girls Club participants, for free skating opportunities. You guys have to come and see it.

They teach them about math and how the puck is a geometric angle and everything. It's really fabulous. They also help local businesses with grants.

So with that, Mr. Chairman, or the late chairman, Rocky Works, he had directed that the original ice rink be very community focused, and this extension is very much in keeping with that. So thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee.

[Speaker 1] (1:51:31 - 1:51:33)
All right, Alderman Villegas.

[Speaker 9] (1:51:35 - 1:52:31)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and excited to support this project. I was fortunate to get briefed by the former chairman, Mr. Works about this project and what he intends to do on the West Side, a lot of exciting things. And I think that the Blackhawk Foundation, although they've supported organizations around United Center, has continued to branch out.

And one of the organizations in my ward is a beneficiary of the block. And just appreciate the partnership and the commitment to not just the West Side, but the city. And again, I wish Mr. Works was here to see this project. But as I said before, there's big, big plans for the West Side, the near West Side, and looking forward to supporting all the projects that come to fruition. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 11] (1:52:33 - 1:52:34)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:52:35 - 1:52:37)
These are comments from colleagues. Alderman Lawson.

[Speaker 23] (1:52:38 - 1:53:12)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to echo what my colleague Alderman Villegas said. The continued investment in the neighborhood on the West Side is really, really impressive.

And I had the opportunity to hear from Rocky about his vision as well, and how this is sustainable. I think when we talk about sports teams, I know a little about one, right? We have to look at what they're doing in the community.

What's their impact in their immediate neighborhood? What's their impact citywide? Because it's not all equal at all.

And I think the Blackhawks are a real leader there. Cubs are too. But I want to just commend you on this project and everything else you're doing over there.

Thank you.

[Speaker 11] (1:53:16 - 1:53:24)
Are there other questions or comments from committee members? I'm sorry, what? All right.

[Speaker 1] (1:53:24 - 1:53:36)
Alderman Villegas moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Are there any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed as revised.

[Speaker 10] (1:53:36 - 1:53:37)
Thank you so very much.

[Speaker 1] (1:53:38 - 1:54:04)
Okay. So this is number 22205 in the second ward. This is 1633 to 1649 North Halsted Street.

And this is a B3-2 Community Shopping District to a B3-5 Community Shopping District. And then to a Residential Business Plan Development. And we have Katie Dale and Rich Clowarder.

[Speaker 8] (1:54:05 - 1:54:53)
Thank you. Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Katie Janke Dale from the law firm of DLA Piper.

And we represent the applicant in this matter, DK Halsted LLC, which is an SBA controlled by Druper and Kramer. Nope. Did you guys incorporate the record already from Planning Commission?

Okay, great. Thank you. The site is located on the east side of Halsted across the street from Steppenwolf Theater.

The proposed development consists of a new construction eight-story building with up to 131 dwelling units and 34 parking spaces. The development will provide 20 affordable units on site and pay a fee in lieu of nearly $1 million. The project team engaged in a very robust community process led by Alderman Hopkins, including several meetings with neighborhood stakeholder groups and presenting at two well-attended neighborhood meetings.

I'm available for any questions, but thank you for your time and consideration. I see Alderman Hopkins is here. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:54:54 - 1:54:59)
Excellent. All right. Alderman Hopkins, would you like to speak on this item?

[Speaker 18] (1:55:00 - 1:56:58)
Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Councilor. Just briefly, I'm in full support of this item.

The attorney on record did acknowledge that it was a robust community process and it was indeed lasting multiple years. A number of community meetings, including one actually on stage at Steppenwolf Theater itself, which was a rather unique experience for me. I can always say my career now included performing at Steppenwolf.

But Steppenwolf is in fact a partner with this development. They will provide housing for artists in residence at Steppenwolf and it is expected to revitalize that particular block of Halsted Street at a time when we all know the community theater environment in Chicago is actually struggling to emerge from these post-pandemic times. They need all the help they can get and this project will bring help to them.

We did, as a result of the community process, make some design changes. There was a very modest reduction in both height and density, you know, just a small one, but I do want to acknowledge that. And also a aesthetic design change in the rendering that you see before you.

Some masonry elements were added to be in conformity with the historic nature of this block, particularly just to the north there at the intersection of Halsted and Willow where there are landmark buildings. And the design changes were invoked by the appearance of those structures as well. I am prepared to move forward with this project now despite there's still a few members of the community that have some outgoing concerns.

But besides that, as was mentioned in today's edition of the Daily Line, if you had an opportunity to read it, talked about the well-received testimony at the plan commission. We did have quite a few members of the community who came and testified in favor of this project at the plan commission hearing. So in deference to them and with an acknowledgement that some of the immediate neighbors remain opposed to this, I would ask for an aye vote and I move approval.

[Speaker 1] (1:57:00 - 1:58:00)
All right. Any other questions or comments from committee members? If not, Alderman Hopkins moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Are there any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed as revised. And we are on our last three items.

Don't go anywhere, Katie, because you're with us for the next two. So the next item is number 22155 in the 27th Ward. This is 375 North Morgan Street and 901 West Kinsey Street.

This is an M2-3 Light Industry District and C2-2 Motor Vehicle Related Commercial District to DX5 Downtown Mixed Use District, then to a Residential Business Plan Development. The item was heard and passed by the Chicago Plan Commission. Is there a motion to incorporate all records and findings from that hearing by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

Alderwoman Claystone moves. Are there any objections? Hearing none, the records are incorporated.

And we have Attorney Katie Jankydale here to speak on this item.

[Speaker 8] (1:58:00 - 1:58:40)
Thank you again for the record. Katie Jankydale from the law firm of DLA Piper. I represent the applicant LP Holdings 375 LLC.

I'm joined today by Fred Lotzko to my right with the applicant. The site is located on the south side of Kinsey between Morgan and Peoria and includes the future Guinness Brewery site and the vacant land to its west. The proposed development consists of a new construction 43-story building with up to 360 dwelling units and 138 parking spaces.

The development will provide 20% affordable units on site and will make a $3.2 million payment into the Neighborhood Opportunity Bonus. We worked very closely with Alderman Burnett and the local community groups on this project and are available for any questions. Thank you for your time and consideration.

[Speaker 1] (1:58:41 - 1:58:46)
Are there any questions or comments from committee members? Alderman Lawson.

[Speaker 23] (1:58:47 - 1:58:52)
Hi, Ms. Dale. Thanks so much. Good to see you.

Just again, you said it was 360 or 460 residential?

[Speaker 8] (1:58:53 - 1:58:55)
You're right. Alderman Lawson, 460.

[Speaker 23] (1:58:55 - 1:58:57)
I don't want you to get, you know, 100 short.

[Speaker 8] (1:58:57 - 1:58:57)
Thank you.

[Speaker 23] (1:58:58 - 1:59:03)
And then, again, it's a payment to the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund. Are there any affordable units on site?

[Speaker 8] (1:59:04 - 1:59:08)
Yes, all 20% of the required units will be on site.

[Speaker 11] (1:59:08 - 1:59:12)
Okay. All right.

[Speaker 1] (1:59:12 - 2:00:18)
Any other questions or comments from committee members? All right. So, hearing none, is there a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

Alderwoman Ramirez moves do pass. Are there any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed as revised.

Okay. Moving on to number 22065 in the 27th Ward. This is 370 North Morgan Street, 400 North Morgan Street, and 401 North Morgan Street.

This is a DS-5 Downtown Service District to a C1-5 Neighborhood Commercial District and M2-3 Light Industry District to DX-7 Downtown Mixed-Use District, then to a Residential Business Plan Development. We have to incorporate some records, so the item was heard and passed by the Chicago Plan Commission, and I have a motion to incorporate all records and findings from the hearing by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Alderwoman Fuentes so moves.

Are there any objections? Hearing none, the records are incorporated. And we have Katie Janke-Dale here to speak on this item.

[Speaker 8] (2:00:19 - 2:01:11)
Thank you again for the record, Katie Janke-Dale from the Law Firm of DLA Paper. We represent the applicant Chicago 413 Carpenter LLC, which is an affiliate of Vista Property Group. I'm joined today by Erk Lat from Vista.

The property consists of three sites located in the southwest, northwest, and northeast corners of Kinsey and Carpenter. The proposed development consists of three buildings consisting of up to 1,450 overall dwelling units. Again, all 20% of required affordable units will be provided on site, and in total, the project will generate approximately $12.9 million for the Neighborhood Opportunity Bonus. Once again, the developer worked very closely with Alderman Burnett and the local community groups, including Neighbors of River West, West Central Association, and NOW on this project and made significant changes as a result. Erk and I are available for any questions, but thank you again for your time and consideration.

[Speaker 1] (2:01:12 - 2:01:15)
And am I reading this correct? This is 1,544 units?

[Speaker 8] (2:01:18 - 2:01:23)
We reduced the unit count after we filed, so the final is 1,450.

[Speaker 1] (2:01:24 - 2:01:36)
1,450, close to 1,500, just shy. Are there any other questions or comments from committee members? Alderman LaSvada looks like he's got a question on his time.

[Speaker 4] (2:01:36 - 2:02:35)
You know, there's a reason I wanted to serve on this committee, because it's fascinating work that we do. I really appreciate your presentation to the Plan Commission, as well, I appreciate the commitment to affordable housing and also to creating publicly accessible open spaces. I'm voting today in faith, and that's a faith that you all continue to work with the CDOT, with our relevant city departments to make sure that the infrastructure that we're building in and around your development supports not only the mobility, but the recreational needs of your residences.

Our committee is moving forward to create the housing that those working in the Fulton Market area need, but we need to make sure that our infrastructure is keeping up with the cumulative impact of that development. So, happy to vote in faith, but we're counting on collaboration with you. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:02:36 - 2:02:55)
Any other questions or comments from committee members? All right, if there are no more, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderman LaSvada moves do pass.

Are there any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed as revised.

[Speaker 8] (2:02:55 - 2:02:55)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:02:55 - 2:03:21)
And we are now moving on to the final item of our agenda, number 22129 in the 16th Ward. This is 1938 to 42 West 63rd Street, and this is an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to C2-1 motor vehicle related commercial district, and we have attorney Manuel Cárdenas here to speak on this item.

[Speaker 20] (2:03:21 - 2:05:19)
Good morning. Being the last one, I will be brief, so I'll be only an hour and a half. Good morning, everyone.

Mr. Chairman, good morning, members of the committee. Thank you, and good morning. I present to you with Ms. Sylvia Hurtado, the owner of Reynoso Insulation, a proposal to change zoning to a C2-1. Currently, it's three lots. One has a single structure commercial building on it, and the other two are vacant. The business is owned by a minority woman of color, and it provides green insulation spray foam, and it works a lot with the neighborhood, with the community, in order to help communities, houses, and owners save energy and also fight climate change.

What she's looking to do is able to have an office space. She wants to be able to have warehousing and also a place for people to come in and look at the type of services, ask questions. She's worked with the city before to help houses, low-income neighborhoods, upgrade their insulation so that they can save, as stated before, money.

It will provide about three jobs in the neighborhood outside of the people that they currently employ. It's looking to also promote development in an area that's in need of development. We have had the support of the Honorable Councilwoman Coleman, as well previous Mr. Lopez, Alderman Lopez, I apologize, had expressed his support. If you have any questions, we're here to respond to any questions.

[Speaker 1] (2:05:19 - 2:06:07)
Any questions or comments? All right, hearing none, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Vice Chair Lawson moves do pass.

Are there any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed. I would just like to note that by my count, we have legalized 2,233 units of housing today in the city of Chicago.

So that's phenomenal. And all right, if there's no more business before the committee, is there a motion to adjourn? Alderman Sig Cho-Lopez moves to adjourn.

All in favor? Opposed? All right, in my opinion, the ayes have it.

[Speaker 11] (2:06:07 - 2:06:08)
The meeting is adjourned.
