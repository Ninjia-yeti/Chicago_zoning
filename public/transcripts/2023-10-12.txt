[Speaker 7] (1:14:16 - 1:14:25)
Is anyone on this line? Yes, Alderman. The meeting is being delayed.

[Speaker 13] (1:14:25 - 1:14:27)
I think they don't have enough quorum.

[Speaker 7] (1:14:28 - 1:14:29)
Okay, it's delayed to what?

[Speaker 13] (1:14:30 - 1:14:53)
1225? No, it should begin anytime. We are connected to council chambers, so your sound is going in there.

Well, I know that, but okay, so I'm sending a note. So, is the is the chairman is the chairman in council? One second, let me find out.

[Speaker 1] (1:14:53 - 1:14:57)
This is Chairman Carlos Ramirez-Rosas. We're waiting about 10 more minutes.

[Speaker 13] (1:14:57 - 1:15:09)
Okay, Chairman, thank you. I just needed to know. I didn't see anybody or hear anything.

And then I saw in the notes about some 1225 that my staff had, so I didn't know what that was about. All right, and I just wanted to be sure. Thank you so much.

[Speaker 7] (1:15:09 - 1:21:26)
All right, thank you. Welcome back from recess. It is now 1120 a.m. We will begin with a roll call to determine quorum.

[Speaker 1] (1:21:27 - 1:21:38)
Committee members, please note that your yes or present response will be deemed to be a yes vote when this quorum roll call is used as a reference vote for later items.

[Speaker 7] (1:21:39 - 1:23:10)
Vice Chair Lawson, Alderman LaSpada, Alderman Hopkins, Alderman Hall, Alderwoman Dowell, Alderwoman Harris, Alderman Beal, Alderwoman Ramirez, Alderman Moore, Alderman Moseley, Alderman Moore is present, Chairman, but you may have to do a rule 59 to Yes, we will right after the quorum call.

We will locate Alderwoman Ramirez as she is just a few feet away. Alderwoman Ramirez. Excellent.

[Speaker 1] (1:23:11 - 1:23:40)
So, Alderman Moore and Alderwoman Harris have requested to attend this meeting by remote means under the provisions of rule 59 due to unrelated emergencies. Is there any objection to their requests? Hearing no objection, Alders Moore and Harris are allowed to attend this meeting by remote means.

Welcome Alderman Moore and do we have Alderwoman Harris? All right. Well, we will note that Alderman Moore is present with us virtually.

[Speaker 4] (1:23:40 - 1:23:44)
Motion perhaps for Alderman Harris. Alderman Harris is here.

[Speaker 1] (1:23:45 - 1:23:50)
Welcome Alderwoman Harris. Thank you. We will mark you present.

[Speaker 7] (1:23:50 - 1:23:53)
Oh, mark me absent. All right.

[Speaker 1] (1:23:54 - 1:24:20)
And then we will also note that non-committee member Alderwoman Rosana Rodriguez has also joined us virtually if there are no objections to her joining us virtually at this time. So, we will now move on to the approval of the rule 45 reports containing the minutes of the September hearings of the committee on zoning landmarks and building standards. All members of this committee should have a copy of this report in their packets, and if hearing no objection, do I have a motion by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum to approve the minutes?

[Speaker 7] (1:24:21 - 1:24:25)
Alderman Conway makes a motion. Are there any objections? Yes.

[Speaker 30] (1:24:28 - 1:24:31)
My presence at this meeting, I was in fact present at the meeting.

[Speaker 1] (1:24:31 - 1:27:07)
All right. We will amend the report to reflect the presence of Alderman Hopkins at our September meeting. Are there any objections to the amendment?

All right then. So, there being no objections, we will amend the report to reflect Alderman Hopkins attendance at the September meeting, and we will then renew Alderman Conway's motion to approve the amended report. Are there any objections to approving the report as amended?

Hearing no objections, the report as amendment has been approved. All right. Moving on, we will now hear the items to be deferred.

I will read the page number, the file number, the address, and then take a motion for all at the end. The top two items on page 13, including file number 22246 for the address commonly known as 6536 South Dorchester Avenue. File number 22245 for the address commonly known as 6534 South Dorchester Avenue.

On page 14, file number 2991-T1 for the address commonly known as 4451 South Cottage Grove Avenue. All of page 5, including file number, all of page 15, including file number 22100 for the address commonly known as 200-208 North Halsted, 800-818 West Lake Street. File number 22249 for the address commonly known as 354 North Union Avenue.

If no questions by committee members, Vice Chair, well, Vice Chair lost his hand. So if there's no questions by committee members, Alderman LaSparta makes a motion to defer the previously listed items by the same roll call that was used to determine quarter.

Are there any objections? Hearing no objections, the items have been deferred. Alderman Villegas.

[Speaker 7] (1:27:08 - 1:27:09)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 28] (1:27:09 - 1:27:14)
Not any questions. We wanted to know if there's an addition of a deferral of an item.

[Speaker 1] (1:27:14 - 1:27:46)
You can add that to the list. Thank you. Yes, so we will take a motion when we get to that item.

So at this time, we will begin the public comment period. The public comment period will be limited to 30 minutes. Out of respect for everyone's time, each speaker is limited to three minutes.

We have three public speakers signed up for today's hearing, and we will hear from them now. First up, we have Ubaldo Aguilar representing the United Workers Center who will speak on a subject matter related to zoning.

[Speaker 7] (1:27:49 - 1:27:50)
Good morning.

[Speaker 26] (1:27:50 - 1:29:02)
My name is Ubaldo Aguilar, and I'm the Executive Director with United Workers Center. CTU is a community organization based in the southeast of Chicago funded 16 years ago in the southeast of Chicago. And we are here today because in 2014, CTU had acquired a building for a dollar which makes us really proud because we can have a home for our community.

However, the dream for the community is to build a community garden that is going to be across the street to the building. That building is in 9805 south of Ewing. I know that those lots that we're trying to acquire are part of or have been zoning as a park.

However, those lots have been utilized to dumping garbage and just storage some old cars back there. And we would like to know what's going to be the process to obtain or get support from the city to obtain those lots. That's going to be my question for today.

I would like to have some answer on how that's going to happen.

[Speaker 1] (1:29:04 - 1:29:17)
Thank you so much. We will have a committee staffer follow up with you, Mr. Aguilar. You have 1 minute 40 remaining.

Do you have any additional comments? Or does that complete your...

[Speaker 26] (1:29:17 - 1:29:34)
No, I believe so. It's going to be for the community. We're going to be trying to community members just building a garden where they can grow their vegetables back there and just have people gathering healthily.

And that's the purpose of this building. I mean, the garden, sorry.

[Speaker 1] (1:29:36 - 1:29:37)
Thank you so much, Mr. Aguilar.

[Speaker 7] (1:29:37 - 1:29:51)
Next up, we have Mr. George Blakemore who has not listed a subject matter. Mr. Blakemore. The subject matter is you.

[Speaker 12] (1:29:52 - 1:30:30)
This meeting was supposed to start at 10 a.m. And it's by 1130. And another meeting will be going on at 1. And if you sit on these two committees, you would have to leave this meeting and go to the...

You know, things haven't changed. This is the notorious zoning committee was released. Now, a lot of corruption goes on right here.

In this zoning.

[Speaker 7] (1:30:32 - 1:30:42)
Right here. You have to change this. You didn't have...

[Speaker 12] (1:30:43 - 1:32:52)
If this was private industry, you wouldn't be able to do this. A meeting is supposed to start at 10. And it starts at 1130.

You're getting paid. You were supposed to inform these people to be present. You all are out of control.

Waste, fraud, and abuse, and corruption. Right here in Salish committee. Oh, Salish is gone.

With the glory. And what was the race of Salish? I can play the race card anytime I want.

Hispanic. And now you come. You know, they say nepotism.

My mama was this and then my daddy became, and then my grandkids and I. We won't qualify people to be chair of these committees. To chair these committees.

So that's why it's very, very important for a person like Mr. Blakemore to appear. He knows all about zoning. An old black man, 81 years old, knows how the game is being played.

And it's pay to play here. If you got the money, you can get anything zoned at any time. Pay to play.

And you would have to get paid off maybe your ultimate. They would have to approve it. Again.

Next time you have this meeting, you inform the members to be present. That's your job. If you was in private industry, you would get docked for your time.

Your $140,000 a year job. And you know why this goes on right here in this city? Because the people do not participate.

Everybody here is trying to get something from the government. I'm not.

[Speaker 1] (1:32:53 - 1:33:07)
Thank you so much. Next we have Steven Marsala here to speak on ordinance 2023-0002754. Mr. Marsala.

[Speaker 18] (1:33:08 - 1:34:44)
Hi. Thank you, Council. I'm a little confused because there's three ordinances on page two, all with the same document number of 2023-0002754.

I thought mine was 55, which is the address of 3049-3127 West 5th Avenue, which is the one I'm specifically speaking about. I own the property at 3072-3074 West 5th Avenue. I'm opposing a change in zoning from its current commercial to residential, which would harm any future economic development as far as commercial.

Certainly would prohibit me from actually obtaining and, you know, continuing business of a tenant there. So I'm very concerned that my economic future, as well as that whole strip of 5th Avenue, which I'm not sure if everybody here knows 5th Avenue was such named over 100 years ago as a nod to 5th Avenue in New York. It was once a great bustling and business district here in Chicago.

I could only hope that in the future it will rise again on the west side. However, I don't think it's sensible to change that zoning to residential. Apologies, I'm not sure how this works, if you're supposed to just continue talking for your full three minutes, but does anyone have any questions for me?

[Speaker 1] (1:34:44 - 1:34:56)
Mr. Marsala, this is an opportunity for you to share your comments with the committee. It is not a question and answer session. You do have a minute 15 remaining if you would like to make use of that time.

[Speaker 18] (1:34:57 - 1:35:18)
That's about it. I just want to let you know I oppose any zoning change from an existing commercial district that could potentially host commercial businesses in the future to residential. And obviously it would change my position on owning a commercial space once it's now in the middle of a residential zone.

Thanks.

[Speaker 1] (1:35:18 - 1:35:32)
Thank you so much and we're happy to connect you with your older person on this matter. Next up we have Emily Nevis who is here to speak on A-8848 and A-8849.

[Speaker 9] (1:35:38 - 1:35:56)
Hi, my name is Emily Nevis and I'm one of the founders of Our Revival Chicago which is operating Remova Theater. This change in zoning would allow us to actually do business and make the most out of the funding already granted to us by the city. Thank you.

[Speaker 7] (1:35:57 - 1:36:00)
Thank you so much. All right.

[Speaker 1] (1:36:01 - 1:36:25)
There are no more public speakers and we're now going to start off on page one of the revised agenda with the historical landmark designation for the Eugenie Lane Apartments located at 235 West Eugenie Street located in the second ward. We have Matt Crawford of the Historic Preservation Division of the Department of Planning and Development here to present this matter.

[Speaker 7] (1:36:25 - 1:37:09)
Mr. Crawford. One second. Thank you.

So good morning for the record.

[Speaker 22] (1:37:09 - 1:38:54)
Matt Crawford, I'm a historian with the Department of Planning and Development. I'm here on behalf of the Commission on Chicago Landmarks which has recommended to this body that the Eugenie Lane Apartments be designated as an official Chicago landmark. The building is located at Eugenie Street and North Park Avenue in Old Town.

The Landmarks Commission found that the building is an architecturally significant and thoughtful example of modern architecture that is combined with traditional materials like common brick and wood that respects the historic context of Old Town. The Commission also found that the building is significant as the work of Ben Weiss, an important architect whose designs focus on social responsibility and the human experience of architecture. Weiss took inspiration from vernacular architecture and simple materials.

During the 1970s, he was a member of the Chicago Seven, a group of architects exploring new directions at the end of the modern movement. Throughout his career, Weiss was a pillar of the historic preservation movement in Chicago. He helped found the Chicago Architecture Center.

He was also a long and distinguished member of the Commission on Chicago Landmarks. We would like to acknowledge the Condominium Association at Eugenie Lane. They understand the significance of their building.

They've been excellent stewards and they've asked for this landmark designation. The building is located in the Second Ward and Alderman Hopkins also supports landmark designation. So too does the Old Town Triangle Association.

So on behalf of the Landmarks Commission, I recommend passage of the ordinance designating the building as a Chicago landmark. Thank you. Thank you so much, Mr. Crawford.

[Speaker 1] (1:38:54 - 1:40:20)
We do have the support of Alderman Hopkins on file with the committee. Are there any questions by committee members? All right.

Hearing none, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderman Hopkins, so moves. Are there any objections?

Hearing none, the historic landmark designation for the Eugenie Lane Apartments is passed. Thank you so much. All right.

Moving on, we have one historical landmark fee waiver in the Fourth Ward located at 3402 to 3402.5 South Giles Avenue. We have the support of Alderman Robinson who introduced the matter. We also have Michelle Rimes from the Historical Landmark Division of the Department of Planning and Development here to answer any questions by committee members if they have any.

Are there any questions by committee members? If not, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderwoman Fuentes moves do pass.

Are there any objections? Hearing none, the waiver is passed. I would like to note that Alderwoman Cruz has joined us.

Welcome, Alderwoman. Last up on the addendum is large signs over 100 square feet in area 24 feet above grave. We will hear them all together.

I will read the ward followed by the address and take a motion at the end.

[Speaker 7] (1:40:20 - 1:40:35)
If no questions by committee members, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? I'm going to read these first. In the Second Ward, 801 West North Avenue.

Four signs in the Fourth Ward located at 1353 South Wabash Avenue.

[Speaker 1] (1:40:35 - 1:42:42)
In the Third Ward, 1631 South Michigan Avenue. In the Third Ward, 2232 West Wabash Avenue. In the 11th Ward, 1958 West 35th Street.

In the 11th Ward, 3700 South Morgan Street. In the 19th Ward, 6020 West 95th Street. Two signs in the 27th Ward located at 1001 West Chicago Avenue.

In the 27th Ward, 1806 North Damon Avenue. In the 28th Ward, 717 South Displains. In the 32nd Ward, 2228 North Clybourne Avenue.

In the 32nd Ward, 2647 North Elston Avenue. In the 32nd Ward, 2011 North Damon Avenue. Two signs in the 44th Ward, 41st Ward, located at 6165 North Northwest Highway.

In the 42nd Ward, located at 520 North Michigan Avenue. In the 43rd Ward, located at 2707 North Clark Street. In the 48th Ward, 5250 North Broadway.

In the 48th Ward, 5237 North Broadway. Lastly, in the 50th Ward, 2642 West Devon Avenue. If there are no questions by committee members, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine forum?

Alderwoman Fuentes moves do pass. Are there any objections? Hearing none, the orders are passed.

We will now move on to the regular agenda. In an effort to ensure the committee meeting runs as smoothly as possible, the typical order in which items will be heard has been updated. Items will be grouped together according to witness and will be heard in that order rather than Ward order.

So, we will be going out of order to page 12 and taking an item in the 22nd Ward per the request of Alderman Mike Rodriguez. So, that's number 22271 in the 22nd Ward. This is common address 4724 to 44 South Cicero Avenue.

This is a B3-1 Community Shopping District to C2-1 Motor Vehicle Related District. And we have Attorney Dean Maragos here to testify on this matter.

[Speaker 8] (1:42:43 - 1:45:26)
Very much, Mr. Chairman. For the record, my name is Dean T. Maragos of the law firm of Maragos & Maragos at 1 North LaSalle.

I'm representing the applicant Olympus Properties LLC on two items. One is item number 22271 located at 4724-44 South Cicero. And the second is a number 222272 in the 22nd Ward with the address of 4841-4857 West 47th Street.

The item on the first item is 222271. The change request is a B3-1 Community Shopping District to C2-1 Motor Vehicle Related District to allow accessory outdoor storage to store commercial containers on property. Containers outside to serve the restaurant supply store adjacent to the property located at 4752-58 South Cicero.

The second item, 22272 is a change request from B3-1 Community Shopping District to C2-1 Motor Vehicle Related District to allow an outdoor storage lot to store commercial containers. We have worked with the community and with me here is Stephen Fisher of the Vidim Park Civic League and he is the president. We had a meeting with this organization per the request of the Alderman to make sure the community was given proper notice and transparency.

I am happy to report that after the meeting there was a letter from Stephen to the Alderman stating that there was very strong support for this activity and zoning change from that community. I also have a letter of strong support for zoning change from Alderman Rodriguez for 4841-47 West 47th Street and also another strong letter of support for 4740 South Cicero. We also have in the record the Vidim Park Civic League endorsement.

I would tender this to be added to the record if you do not. We also have a letter from the commander of the 8th Police District Brian Spreen who states in essence that he is very supportive of this organization since it is an asset to the community. That ends our case in chief.

If you have any questions we will gladly speak with you.

[Speaker 1] (1:45:27 - 1:45:57)
Thank you so much. I should note that Mr. Maragos in addition to testifying on number 22271 also spoke to number 22272 at 4841-4857 West 47th Street which is a B3-1 Community Shopping District to a C2-1 Motor Vehicle Related District. We are taking these two items on page 12 together.

Mr. Alderman Rodriguez is in such strong support that he is here to testify on this item. Alderman Rodriguez.

[Speaker 24] (1:45:58 - 1:46:34)
I just wanted to thank the family over at Olympic. They are folk who are multi generational family owners of this small business if you will. They are what our community represents best.

They are invested in the neighborhood. They make sure their weeds are cut. That their space is beautiful and that they partner and that they invest in the neighborhood.

That is why the Venom Park Civic League represented here by Mr. Fischer their president are in strong support as am I. Thank you very much for the opportunity to speak. Thank you so much.

[Speaker 1] (1:46:34 - 1:46:58)
Are there any questions or comments by committee members? If there are no questions by committee members do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderman LaSpada moves do pass for number 22271 and number 22272.

Are there any objections? Hearing none the item is passed. Thank you so much.

[Speaker 8] (1:46:59 - 1:47:01)
Mr. Chairman and members of this august group.

[Speaker 1] (1:47:01 - 1:47:57)
Thank you. We are now going back to page 2. These items we are going to hold them momentarily to allow for the alderman or his representative to arrive.

So we will then be moving on to the first item of page 3. This is number A-8764 in the 24th Ward. This is at 1554 South Kedzie Avenue and 1559 South Kedzie Avenue and this is a B3-2 Community Shopping District to B2-1 Neighborhood Mixed Use District.

We do have a substitute. Alderman LaSpada moves to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Are there any objections?

Hearing none, the substitute is before us and we do have Alderwoman Monique Scott to speak to this item in her ward.

[Speaker 20] (1:48:01 - 1:48:11)
This is an item that I support. Wrong address, but I support the item. It's for new development for homes and Brian O'Donnell is here if he wants to say anything.

[Speaker 1] (1:48:14 - 1:48:22)
So we have Brian O'Donnell from the Department of Planning and Development who can speak to this zoning change.

[Speaker 29] (1:48:25 - 1:49:47)
Good morning Chairman Ramirez-Rosa, Vice Chair Lawson, and committee members. For the record, my name is Brian O'Donnell testifying on behalf of the Homeownership Bureau and the Department of Housing. The Department supports the proposed zoning map amendment as detailed by the Chair.

If approved, this amendment would allow for ground floor residential use on the two parcels. This proposed amendment was included with a batch of similar amendments heard by this committee last year, but a scrivener's error caused a proposed zoning map amendment to be held. Unfortunately, this particular amendment fell through the cracks, so DOH requested that it be heard by this committee as expeditiously as possible.

For the new Alders on this committee, the two lots before you today and the others heard last year are part of a broader Reclaiming Chicago effort led by United Power for Action and Justice and supported by the current and prior mayoral administrations. The current Reclaiming Lawndale effort seeks to build 100 single-family homes in Lawndale. The broader citywide effort seeks to build 1,000 single-family homes on the south side and the west side of Chicago in communities such as North Lawndale, East Garfield Park, New City, Roseland, and Chicago Lawn.

This concludes my testimony.

[Speaker 1] (1:49:50 - 1:50:45)
Thank you so much. Are there any questions or comments by committee members? If there are no questions or comments by committee members, do I hear a motion do pass as substituted by the same roll call that was used to determine whether or not to approve the Are there any objections?

Hearing none, the item is passed. Congratulations, Alderwoman Scott. The item is passed as amended.

Congratulations, Alderwoman Scott. Okay, we're now moving on to number A-8836 in the 13th Ward. This is at 6702-6760 West 65th Street.

This is an RT-4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to RS-2 residential single-unit detached house district. And we have Alderman Marty Quinn here to speak to his item.

[Speaker 13] (1:50:46 - 1:51:34)
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Good morning, members of the committee. This request comes via the residents of the 6701 West 64th Street who have made the request to change the zoning from RT-4 to RS-2 which is the same as the zoning that they have.

The current property has been neglected. It is roaded, infested, and we had Streets and Sanitation spend a week there this past summer with a high lift. needless to say, an absentee landlord on the property.

So, certainly would appreciate the committee's favorable opinion in agreeing with the residents of the 13th Ward on this item. Thank you so much.

[Speaker 1] (1:51:34 - 1:51:37)
Alderman, are there any questions or comments from committee members? Alderman LaSpada.

[Speaker 4] (1:51:38 - 1:51:48)
Thank you, Chair. Alderman Quinn, I just want to understand how the current RT-4 zoning prohibits the kind of development that you're hoping to see in the lot.

[Speaker 13] (1:51:49 - 1:52:01)
What I'm looking for is change it to single-family dwelling which is 65th Street, 64th Place on 64th Place are single-family dwelling homes which the alley would be shared with. So it's just consistency.

[Speaker 4] (1:52:02 - 1:52:04)
But would they not be permitted to build a single-family?

[Speaker 13] (1:52:04 - 1:52:06)
That's what this is going to do.

[Speaker 4] (1:52:07 - 1:52:09)
And they couldn't do that with the RT-4 zoning?

[Speaker 13] (1:52:10 - 1:52:17)
That I'm not certain. This is the request of the residents is that they want single-family.

[Speaker 4] (1:52:18 - 1:52:25)
Okay. I might be unclear as to what is permitted under the existing zoning, but that's the whole of my question.

[Speaker 13] (1:52:25 - 1:52:35)
Another way of looking at it, Alderman, is the residents don't want anything but single-family. And this would put that in question.

[Speaker 4] (1:52:35 - 1:52:40)
That clarifies the point. Okay. Thank you.

[Speaker 13] (1:52:40 - 1:52:49)
You're welcome. Before I conclude, if I could submit a petition from the residents along with some photos of the current property. Thank you so much.

[Speaker 1] (1:52:50 - 1:54:06)
We will file those on the record with the committee, Alderman Quinn. Thank you. Are there any other questions or comments by committee members?

All right. Hearing none, is there a motion due pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderman Riley moves due pass.

Are there any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed. Thank you so much, Alderman Quinn.

Thank you. We would like to note that Alderman Vice Chair Lawson has joined us and will be marked as present for the quorum. All right.

Moving along to the third item on page 3. And we're going to take these next two items together. So that's number A-8848 in the 11th Ward, common address 3509-3515 South Halsted Street.

This is an RS3 residential single unit detached house district and a B1-3 neighborhood shopping district to B3-2 community shopping district. And we have number A-8849 also in the 11th Ward. This is 3519-59 South Halsted Street.

And this is an RS3 residential single unit detached house district and B1-1 neighborhood shopping district to B3-2 community shopping district. And we have Mr. Carlos Diaz of the 11th Ward office here to speak to these two items.

[Speaker 7] (1:54:13 - 1:54:14)
There.

[Speaker 13] (1:54:16 - 1:54:43)
Halsted Avenue has long been a mixed use commercial corridor. But for some reason different buildings were down zoned. We're just asking that they be rezoned to B3-2 to allow the previous intended use for such buildings and to make it a commercial corridor that would allow and attract businesses that have left the area.

[Speaker 1] (1:54:45 - 1:55:58)
Are there any questions or comments from committee members for Mr. Carlos Diaz? All right. Hearing none, do I hear a motion do pass for these two items, A-8848 and A-8849 by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Alderwoman Clay, motions do pass. Are there any objections? Hearing none, these two items are passed.

Thank you so much, Mr. Diaz. Okay. Is there anyone here from the 9th Ward?

Okay. Since there's no one here from the 9th Ward, we will hold that item. Moving on to page 4, there's number 22244 in the 50th Ward.

This is common address 6724 to 28 North Rockwell Street. This is an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to RT 3.5 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district and we have attorney Michael Esger here to speak on this item. How's it going, Michael?

[Speaker 30] (1:55:58 - 1:56:38)
Good. Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. Michael Esger on behalf of the applicant.

6724 North Rockwell LLC and this property consists of a current building that contains five units and six parking spaces and the applicant would like to add an interior remodeling to one of the storage spaces to make it an additional unit and for that purpose seeks a zoning map amendment from RS3 to RT 3.5. We had a community meeting that went well and Alderwoman Silverstein has a letter of support on file with the committee. I'm here for any questions.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:56:39 - 1:56:46)
Thank you so much. We do have a letter of support from Alderwoman Silverstein on file. Are there any questions or comments from committee members?

Alderman La Spada.

[Speaker 4] (1:56:47 - 1:56:52)
Thank you. Michael, do we have to see housing being added? Is this an accessory unit?

[Speaker 30] (1:56:53 - 1:57:18)
It's actually just another unit within the building. The building is an old 100-year-old plus building that has some of this vacant space that's like an underutilized storage or laundry room and they thought if they could add a unit, to your point, why not? That's a good use of the space and there's already parking so the neighborhood likes it and it seems like a win-win.

[Speaker 4] (1:57:19 - 1:57:20)
Fantastic. Glad to hear it. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:57:20 - 1:57:21)
Absolutely.

[Speaker 4] (1:57:21 - 1:57:21)
Thank you, Chair.

[Speaker 1] (1:57:22 - 1:57:59)
Any other questions or comments by committee members? All right. Seeing none, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

Alderwoman Fuentes moves do pass. Are there any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Thank you. All right. Next up, we have number 22265 in the 45th Ward.

This is 5726 Northwest Highway and this is an M1-1 Limited Manufacturing District to M2-1 Light Industry District and we have Attorney Sarah Barnes here to speak to this item.

[Speaker 2] (1:58:00 - 1:59:32)
Thank you. Good morning, Mr. Chairman and esteemed members of the committee. For the record, my name is Sarah Barnes and I'm an attorney with the lobsters of Sam Banks.

I am sitting here today in the stead of my partner Nick Viticus who is unable to be here today due to a conflict. I'm here on behalf of the applicant and the property owner Chicago Title Land Trust number 014418. The applicant does own the subject property and is seeking a zoning change in order to permit the use of the subject property for outdoor fleet storage of trucks and moving containers.

The zoning change is solely related to the use of the property. The existing building and other improvements will not be altered in any fashion. The applicant and Mr. Viticus have worked with Alderman Gardner as well as met with the local community organizations regarding this zoning map amendment and all such parties have offered their support. As well, Mr. Viticus was working with the Department of Planning and Development throughout the process in order to confirm the best zoning for this property and so I believe there is also correspondence with Commissioner Murphy in that regard. We are happy to answer any questions that you may have and otherwise just very respectfully and humbly seek the recommendation of the committee.

[Speaker 1] (1:59:33 - 2:00:16)
Are there any questions from committee members? All right, if there are no questions by committee members, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderwoman Cruz moves do pass.

Are there any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed. So we're going to make the most of Alderwoman Ms. Sarah Barnes being here. And so we're going to jump over to page 5 to the last item there. This is number 22247 in the 41st ward. This is 6558 North Milwaukee Avenue and this is a B3-1 Community Shopping District to B2-2 Neighborhood Mixed Use District.

Attorney Barnes.

[Speaker 2] (2:00:16 - 2:01:42)
Thank you. Thank you again, Mr. Chairman and esteemed members of the committee. Once again, for the record, my name is Sarah Barnes and I'm an attorney with the Lopses of Sam Banks.

I'm here this afternoon now on behalf of the applicant AGC Holdings Incorporated, which owns the subject property. The property has been vacant for several years now and is actually on the border of the city. It's one of the last properties still within city limits and is situated in the 41st ward.

The applicant is seeking a zoning map amendment in order to reactivate this desolate site with a new three-story, nine-unit all-residential building which will feature three dwelling units on each of the first through third floors and off-street parking for nine vehicles. We have met with Alderman Napolitano as well as the 41st Ward Zoning Advisory Committee, which is comprised of community liaisons representing all of the different organizations that comprise the 41st Ward. And we are presenting this to you here today with the support of both Alderman Napolitano as well as the 41st Ward Zoning Advisory Committee.

I'm happy to answer any questions. Otherwise, again, just would respectfully and humbly request your approval here today.

[Speaker 1] (2:01:43 - 2:01:52)
We do have Alderman Napolitano's support on record. Are there any questions by committee members? Alderman Espada.

[Speaker 4] (2:01:53 - 2:02:05)
Thank you, Chair. I'm just I'm curious, going from the dash three, the B3 to B2, is this in the interest of doing ground floor residential?

[Speaker 2] (2:02:06 - 2:02:54)
Exactly, yeah. So this property is kind of uniquely situated. It's on an all-residential block, but it's on the corner.

It comprises a triangular property on the corner. So the community thought that it would be a nice transition amongst the residential, the lower-density residential neighborhoods, and then kind of the more mixed-use along Milwaukee Avenue. So there hasn't been, according to the community liaisons, they've been struggling on getting new commercial to occupy some of these vacant storefronts.

So they thought it would be better to have an all-residential building where there would be more vested members of that community to then support the commercial enterprises.

[Speaker 4] (2:02:55 - 2:02:58)
Okay, that's a helpful analysis. Good context. Thank you, Chair.

[Speaker 1] (2:02:59 - 2:03:36)
Thank you so much. Any other questions or comments by committee members? If there are no questions or comments by committee members, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to establish quorum?

Alderman Espada moves do pass. Are there any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Thank you so much, Attorney Sarah Barnes. So I want to note that Alderman Mosley has joined us and will be marked present for the quorum. Okay, so moving on, we are at item three on page four, and this...

[Speaker 7] (2:03:36 - 2:03:58)
I have one more. Nope. 1001 North Milwaukee.

I think... Okay. Sorry.

So we're looking at page six now.

[Speaker 1] (2:03:59 - 2:04:20)
This is the final item represented by Attorney Sarah Barnes. This is number 22257 in the 27th Ward. This is 1001 North Milwaukee Avenue, and this is a B1-2 Neighborhood Shopping District to B2-3 Neighborhood Mixed Use District.

Attorney Sarah Barnes.

[Speaker 2] (2:04:20 - 2:07:11)
Thank you so much. One last time, thank you again, Mr. Chairman and esteemed members of the committee. For the record, my name is Sarah Barnes and I am an attorney with the lobsters of Sam Banks.

I'm super happy to be here this afternoon on behalf of the applicant, SB 1001 Time LLC who also owns the subject property. The subject property is presently improved with a four-story mixed-use building. Some of you may be familiar with it.

If you ever drive down the Kennedy Expressway, it is the Caterpillar Daycare Center building that's right off the Milwaukee Theater Ramp. The subject property, as presently configured, has the daycare center on the first floor with a total of eight dwelling units located on and between the second and third floors. The fourth floor is currently vacant, but it contains office suites.

For the past several years, those office suites have remained vacant and underutilized despite the best efforts of the property owner in getting office tenants in there. In order to fully activate the property, especially in the interest of the daycare center, the proposal calls for the conversion of the fourth floor office suites into dwelling units which would call for the establishment of a total of 12 dwelling units within the envelope of the existing four-story building. The zoning change, therefore, is required because in order to allow for additional dwelling units to be established within that building due to the minimum lot area requirements, the physical structure of the existing building will not be altered or expanded in any way.

There is off-street parking for a total of 16 vehicles that will be specifically designated to the tenants of the building. We've worked with Alderman Burnett as well as with the Eckert Park Community Council towards this proposal. In the interest of this proposal and in consideration of the support of the community and our engagement with the community, the owner has agreed to do one of the new four units as an affordable unit even though such is not required under the current affordable requirements ordinance.

There will be one of the four units that will be designated as affordable. With that, I am happy to defer it to Alderman Burnett if you would like to make any comments. Otherwise, just again, respectfully request your approval.

[Speaker 1] (2:07:14 - 2:07:18)
Alderman Burnett, would you like to speak on this item at 1001 North Milwaukee Avenue?

[Speaker 10] (2:07:19 - 2:07:33)
Sure. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As the Councilor said, she met with the local community group.

They support this project. We encourage the developer to put in an affordable unit, although it is not required. He agreed to it, so we support this.

[Speaker 1] (2:07:33 - 2:07:52)
Thank you so much, Alderman Burnett. Are there any questions or comments by committee members? All right.

If there are none, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine forum? Alderman Burnett moves do pass. Are there any objections?

Hearing none, the item is passed.

[Speaker 2] (2:07:52 - 2:07:53)
Thank you so much.

[Speaker 1] (2:07:54 - 2:08:17)
We are now back on page 4. This is number 22270 in the 43rd Ward. Comment address 345 West Armitage Avenue.

This is a B1-2 Neighborhood Shopping District to C1-2 Neighborhood Commercial District. We have Attorney Thomas Moore here to speak on this item.

[Speaker 15] (2:08:18 - 2:09:38)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. As you said, my name is Tom Moore for the record. This is a company that is iconic up in Uptown.

We had letters from former Aldermen and the community organization and the Chamber of Commerce in Uptown suggesting that Lincoln Park would be lucky to get this deli. The location has been empty for 10 years. It is a great corner.

It is at Lincoln and Armitage. We had two community meetings. We had a combined community meeting with the two community groups, one that the property is in and the other across the street.

We had a spirited discussion. We worked out a plan of operation which a few words of which were even changed late last night. In final, everybody is happy that the business is coming to Lincoln Park and is supportive of it.

We have a letter of support from the Alderman of the 43rd Warden. We appreciate your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (2:09:39 - 2:10:21)
We do have a letter on file from Alderman Timmy Knudson. Any questions or comments? If there are no questions, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

Alderman Mosley moves do pass. Are there any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Sticking with Mr. Thomas Moore, we are going on to the top of page 5, number 22267 in the 31st Ward. This is 4903 West Diversity Avenue. This is a B1-2 neighborhood shopping district to C2-1 motor vehicle related district.

Mr. Moore.

[Speaker 15] (2:10:21 - 2:11:12)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is a third generation truck repair business across the street from this location. They want to expand.

They employ people in the neighborhood. The business was started by Mr. DeLazer, the current operator's grandfather. His father worked in it all of his life, and he now has taken the reins of it.

They literally service hundreds of trucks to keep them running in the whole area. But in order to expand, we need a motor vehicle related district. We've been to see Alderman Cardona, and we have a letter of support from him, and he is here also, and we request your support.

[Speaker 1] (2:11:14 - 2:11:16)
Alderman Cardona, would you like to speak to this item?

[Speaker 19] (2:11:17 - 2:12:03)
Thank you, Chairman Rosa. I speak on this item because it's one of our businesses. It's a staple in Belmont Cregan.

It's been there for three generations. I spoke to the family. They've been there for 80 years in Belmont Cregan.

Their business is fixing trucks, either delivery trucks or other vehicles with between 10 to 12 wheelers. They did buy the lot across the street to expand their business. I did speak to the residents surrounding.

They're good neighbors. It's good for the community. It's good for everybody because he employs people from the neighborhood.

I support this zoning change in this matter, and I ask my colleagues here for their support. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:12:04 - 2:12:22)
Any questions or comments from committee members? All right. If there are none, do I hear a motion to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

Alderwoman Cruz moves do pass. Are there any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

[Speaker 15] (2:12:23 - 2:12:24)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (2:12:25 - 2:12:59)
We're going to momentarily skip the second item on page five, and we're going to move on to the second item on page six. This is number 22262-T1 in the 40th Ward. This is 5338 to 40 North Lincoln Avenue.

This is a B3-2 Community Shopping District to B3-3 Community Shopping District, and we have Attorney Agnes Fleca here to speak to this item.

[Speaker 17] (2:12:59 - 2:14:49)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My name is Agnes Fleca, for the record. I'm an attorney with the office of Jaffe and Berlin, located at 111 West Washington, and I'm here to represent the applicants 5338 and Lincoln LLC, and we are proposing, as you aptly said, a rezoning from B3-2 Community Shopping District to a B3-3 District, and very simply, this is a double-odd with 50 food frontage along Lincoln.

It is currently with an older commercial building, which has been vacant for five years. The existing building has some functional obsolescence and has some structural issues, so it's not a good candidate for rehab, so the applicant is proposing to redevelop the property with a new building, mixed-use, four-story, and commercial on the ground floor and nine dwelling units on the upper floors. The three units on each floor will be approximately 1,300 square feet, and the building being four-story is in compliance and compatible with the existing land-use pattern along this stretch of Lincoln.

The commercial on this space, the commercial space on the ground floor will be occupied by Home Healthcare Agency, which the community was very excited about, that we can actually bring this very essential service to the neighborhood, and it will definitely promote reactivation of the commercial corridor along this stretch of Lincoln Avenue. We have worked very closely with Alderman Vasquez and his wonderful staff. We had a community meeting well attended.

We had many comments afterwards. Everybody supported the project, so hopefully you have a letter of support from Alderman Vasquez as well in your records. I do have a copy just in case, and we very humbly ask you for support for this project.

[Speaker 1] (2:14:50 - 2:15:12)
We have heard from Alderman Vasquez and do have his support on the record. Are there any questions for Attorney Pleka? All right.

If there are none, is there a motion? Do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Alderman Hall moves do pass.

Are there any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

[Speaker 17] (2:15:13 - 2:15:15)
Thank you, sir, and thank you, members of the committee.

[Speaker 1] (2:15:15 - 2:15:34)
All right. Moving on to the third item on page six. This is number 22275 in the 38th Ward.

This is 4306 North Central Avenue, and this is a C1-1 Neighborhood Commercial District to C2-1 Motor Vehicle Related District, and we have Attorney Mark Kupiak here.

[Speaker 10] (2:15:34 - 2:17:10)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My name is Mark Kupiak. I'm an attorney with Office of the 77 West Washington, represent the applicant.

On behalf of the applicant, the principal of the applicant is Herb Berries. Herb is actually out of town today. That's why he's not here.

But this particular site, this particular existing business is a Crafty Beaver business, and Crafty Beaver is kind of a version of Home Depot, a big hardware store, has operated Crafty Beaver at this site for about 40 years, and prior to that, the Skokie Lumber Company operated on this site. More recently, Herb had his architect go down to City Hall to apply for a fence permit because he wanted to put up a black ornamental fence around his parking area, and the permit people noted that property Zones C1, but the Crafty Beaver, as you can well imagine, does in fact have some outdoor storage, out some display, outdoor display of lumber and seasonal items. So the zoning department told them that actually for the outdoor storage, outdoor display, they should have a C2 zoning district, despite the fact they've operated with a city business license all these years, and planned no change in the business, but he would like to get a permit for the fence.

So we're asking for a zoning change to rezone it to C2 for the outdoor storage and display, and have talked with Alderman Sposato, and I believe he sent a letter of support.

[Speaker 1] (2:17:11 - 2:17:51)
Thank you so much. We have heard from Alderman Sposato, and he is in support. Are there any questions or comments by committee members?

Do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine form? Alderman Mosley moves do pass. Are there any objections?

Hearing none, the item is passed. All right, moving on to page 7. This is number 22269 in the 36th Ward.

This is at 3015 North Normandy. This is an RS-2 Residential Single Unit Detached House District to RS-3 Residential Single Unit Detached House District, and we have Attorney Mark Kupiec here to present on this item.

[Speaker 10] (2:17:51 - 2:18:42)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm Mark Kupiec. I'm an attorney, 77 West Washington.

I represent the applicant John Pushkars. John is a builder-developer. He has worked in that immediate area over the recent years building single-family homes.

Subject property is a vacant 60-foot parcel. He's asking to rezone it from RS-2 to RS-3 so he can divide it into two 30-foot lots, and then build one single-family home on each 30-foot lot for a total of two units. With that, we've been in contact with the Alderman and his staff explaining the project, sending them some pictures and samples, etc., and I believe you do have a letter of support from the Alderman, although obviously the Alderman is here.

[Speaker 1] (2:18:43 - 2:21:11)
All right. We do have his support on record. Any questions or comments by committee members?

All right. Do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderman Villegas moves do pass.

Are there any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed. All right.

The next item will be deferred. This is number 20686-T1 in the 36th Ward. This is at 1812 to 1814 West Grand Avenue.

If there are no questions by committee members, Vice Chair Lawson makes a motion to defer the previously read item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Are there any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Okay. Thank you so much. We are going back.

Excellent. So we are going back to page 2. We're going to defer one of the items and then we're going to hear the other two.

So first we will do the deferral. So this is number A-8839 in the 28th Ward. Common address 3049 to 3127 West 5th Avenue and 3064 to 3134 West 5th Avenue and 141 to 43 South Troy Street.

So if there are no questions by committee members, Vice Chair Lawson makes a motion to defer the previously read item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Are there any objections? Hearing none, the item is deferred.

All right. And now we will hear two items on page 2 together. This is number A-8838 in the 28th Ward for common address 3023 to 43 West 5th Avenue and this is a C1-2 Neighborhood Commercial District to RT4 Residential 2 Flat Townhouse and Multi-Unit District.

And then we have number A-8840 also in the 28th Ward. This is common address 3001 to 3013 West 5th Avenue and this is a C1-2 Neighborhood Commercial District to RT-4 Residential 2 Flat Townhouse and Multi-Unit District and we have Alderman Jason Irvin here to speak on these two items.

[Speaker 21] (2:21:12 - 2:22:49)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This area in East Garfield Park is roughly bordered by Sacramento on the east Kesey to the west. This area previously, probably some 40-50 years ago may have been a little more commercially intensive, but today primarily consists of residential structures and vacant properties.

Working with the Department of Planning, it was agreed that the predominant zoning district in the areas north and south of this was the RT4 which goes with the character of the community being 2-3 flat which is the predominant structure type in that area and pretty much in East Garfield Park. The luxury here is that we're seeing a push for more affordable residence. We just broke ground on 5th City Commons which is 80 plus unit affordable residential development.

So coupled with that and what we're seeing going forward, the primary use in this area should be residential. Again, why it was zoned C1 which allows for some pretty intense stuff in the middle of a neighborhood just doesn't mess with today's standards. There's one additional ordinance that we'll deal with later.

I have one property owner that we're trying to figure out, but for the balance of this, we think that the down zoning of this from a C to a R is in line with the balance of the community over there. I would appreciate a favorable motion to pass this item. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:22:49 - 2:23:16)
Thank you so much. Alderman Irvin, are there any questions or comments by committee members? All right.

Hearing none, do I hear a motion do pass for number A-8838 and number A-8840 by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Alderman Mosley moves do pass. Are there any objections?

Hearing none, the previously read items are passed. Thank you so much.

[Speaker 7] (2:23:16 - 2:23:17)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:23:18 - 2:24:02)
Okay. So we are now going back to page five to the second item. This is number 22274-T1 in the 43rd Ward.

This is 2014 to 16 North Basel Street and this is an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to RM5.5 residential multi-unit district. We do have substitute narrative and plans. So Vice Chair Lawson moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the Type 1 application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Are there any objections? Hearing none, the substitute narrative and plans are accepted and we have Tom Pekarsky here to speak to this item.

[Speaker 28] (2:24:03 - 2:25:21)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. I am Tom Pekarsky of the Law Firm of Gordon and Pekarsky here on behalf of the applicant, Arsalan Hamidi. We're before you seeking an amendment to the City of Chicago zoning map from the current RT4 to that of an RM 5.5 for the property commonly known as 2014 to 16 North Basel Street. The subject site is composed of two legal lots collectively measuring 53 by 75 feet. The lots are improved with a four unit residential building on the northern portion of the property and unimproved property on the southern portion. The applicant proposes to amend the zoning in order to subdivide the zoning lot into two lots.

The resulting northern lot will maintain the existing four residential unit building. The resulting southern lot will be improved with a three unit residential building. We have reviewed our plans with Alderman Knudson and appeared before an extensive community process with the Sheffield Neighbors Association.

No objections have been voiced to the proposal and both the Sheffield Neighbors and Alderman Knudson have issued their support for the project and therefore we ask the committee to vote its recommendation of passage of the application to the full City Council.

[Speaker 1] (2:25:23 - 2:25:59)
We have heard from Alderman Knudson. He is in support. Are there any questions or comments by committee members?

Hearing none, do I have a hear motion to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Alderman LaSpada moves to pass. Are there any objections?

Hearing none, the item is passed. Thank you for your time and good afternoon. We're moving on to the third item on page seven.

This is number 22261 in the 36th Ward. This is common address 2736 West Chicago Avenue. This is C1-2 Neighborhood Commercial District to B2-2 Neighborhood Mixed Use District.

We have Attorney Andrew S.F. Harrison here to speak on this item.

[Speaker 6] (2:25:59 - 2:27:02)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman. I am Andrew Harrison here on behalf of owner Adam Lucas regarding the property at 2736 West Chicago Avenue. This is currently zoned as C1-2 and consists of a residential apartment on the second floor with a long vacant commercial space on the first floor.

The owner would like to use that first floor as an artist's live-work studio. There doesn't appear to be any interest in reviving the commercial space, but he has heard some interest from people in the arts community in using that as a live-work space. We're essentially looking to turn the vacant commercial space into a usable space in this neglected property.

We also have spoken with Alderman Villegas and he is in support of the project. He's here to correct me if I am mistaken. Yes, we're moving to change this from a C1-2 to a B2-2 to allow an artist's live-work space in the currently vacant first floor.

[Speaker 1] (2:27:02 - 2:27:08)
Thank you. We have heard from Alderman Villegas and he is in support. Are there any questions or comments by committee members?

Alderman La Spada.

[Speaker 4] (2:27:11 - 2:27:39)
Microphone, there we go. I really appreciate the case. I think it's a smart reflection on how we're trying to right-size commercial in the city of Chicago.

I wondered if you could share, because we do have this trend of C1 to B2, how a live-work space, maybe the edification of the public and perhaps this alderman, how a live-work space differs than just adding a residential space on the ground floor?

[Speaker 6] (2:27:40 - 2:28:02)
An artist's live-work space would allow for example, a small gallery in the non-residential portion, probably the front of the actual unit, while the artist could live in the rear of the unit and use the gallery when it's not open to the public to do their work and then allow public viewings or have shows there at other times.

[Speaker 4] (2:28:03 - 2:28:07)
Fantastic. Thank you so much. Really exciting project.

Thank you, Chair.

[Speaker 1] (2:28:07 - 2:28:59)
Are there any other questions or comments by committee members? If not, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderman Fuentes moves do pass.

Are there any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed. All right.

We're moving on to the top of page 8. This is number 22242-T1 in the 32nd Ward. This is 2469 to 2471 North Clybourne Avenue.

This is an M1-2 limited manufacturing business park district to our M4.5 residential multi-unit district and we have Monica Shamas here to speak to this item. Before she speaks to this item, we do have substitute narrative and plans. Vice Chair Lawson moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type 1 application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Are there any objections? Hearing none, the substitute narrative and plans are accepted. Attorney Monica Shamas.

[Speaker 5] (2:28:59 - 2:32:25)
Thank you for having us here today. My name is Monica Shamas. I am from Schoenberg Finkel, Biedermann, Ballin & Glaser.

I'm actually joined today by the applicant and the owner with the manager, Jim Moller from GMO LLC as well as the architect's project manager, Jeremiah Pescolato. The proposed property is located at 2469 to 2471 North Clybourne, 60614. It's directly located between Fullerton and Wrightwood.

By way of brief summary, the applicant is seeking a type 1 zoning map amendment changing the underlying zoning classification from M1-2 to RM4.5 while remaining consistent with the bulk and density standards of RM4.5. Currently, the property is a vacant lot measuring 50 by 150. The applicant is looking to build two residential buildings and instead measuring 25 by 150 on the two subdivided lots. The proposed residential buildings will both be three stories with basements.

They will have one outdoor parking space that will be paved as well as two garage parking spaces in the rear. Outwardly, the buildings will present with brick faces as well as on the siding. They will have decorative stone banding along the front as well as stone crown molding near the top.

They will have balconies for each unit, both in the front and then a steel porch in the rear. And that will hopefully capitalize on outdoor space and sunlight within each unit. The first unit is duplex down, third unit is a duplex up with rooftop access.

The proposed buildings will have no commercial space. Each building will have a width of about 21 by 90 feet. So the block itself and nearby areas have developed with multi-story and multi-residential buildings.

So the proposed project is compatible and in conformity with how that neighborhood and that block specifically are trending. I've actually lived in the area myself for many years and have watched it trend towards residential buildings of a similar nature as well as having some commercial. So the area is shifting away from the industrial uses and progressing in that.

So the applicant has worked diligently with the Alderman's office on this project for a few years. This building has gone through many iterations due to the collaborative efforts between the Alderman's office as well as the applicant. It looks a little bit different today than it did beforehand and now is matching and trending with what the Alderman sees for that area.

The applicant has taken great care to make sure that the building not only compliments you know or sorry both buildings compliment not only one another but also those in the surrounding areas without being copies and mimicking. On a positive note we have received the support from the Alderman and have no knowledge of any objections from the neighbors all of which that we are thankful for. Applicant is a member of the community himself and owns other properties in this area and is experienced in development and maintaining properties.

He's committed to providing a positive impact you know by way of taking a vacant lot and creating something that not only helps with the aesthetic of the neighborhood but also increases you know the tax generation coming from that property. Also by getting rid of a vacant lot hopefully it will help increase any amount of safety and crime that may you know come with those. We sincerely appreciate all the time that the Alderman and the City have put into this and so therefore I yield for any questions.

[Speaker 1] (2:32:25 - 2:33:25)
Thank you. We have heard from Alderman Wagesbeck who is in support. Are there any questions or comments for Attorney Monica Shamas?

All right. Hearing none, do I hear a motion do pass with the substitute narrative and plans by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Vice Chair Lawson moves do pass.

Are there any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed with the substitute narrative and plans. Thank you so much.

Okay. We're now going to go out of order per request of a committee member. So this is page 14 item, second item, number 22259 in the 6th Ward.

Ordinance comment address 6700 South Wabash Avenue. This is an RS3 residential single unit detached house district a C2-1 motor vehicle related district and we have witness Oscar Lockwood here to speak to this item.

[Speaker 25] (2:33:28 - 2:34:54)
Good afternoon Chairman Ramirez-Rosa. Correct? And members of the committee.

My name is Oscar Lockwood. I'm the business owner of Tire Empire and EVA Auto Empire located at 6707 South State. I'm seeking approval of a map amendment application from RS3 residential unit district to that of C2-1 motor vehicle related commercial district in order to establish an auto storage and accessory use for my existing tire shop and auto sales business located at 6707 South State.

I've spoken with the Alderman Hall and met with the neighbors and after the meeting the Alderman indicated his support of this application. Subject property located at 6700 South Wabash is situated immediately east or across from the alley of my existing business office and tire shop. The proposed auto storage property is approximately 6200 square foot fence and gated improved vacant lot.

With me today is Mr. Kareem Musawwir, my land use consultant. We're both here to answer any questions the committee might have and I hope that you will approve my application to amend the zoning that of C2-1 motor vehicle related commercial district. I'd also like to thank your staff and the staff of the zoning department for helping me come before you today.

That's all I have Mr. Chairman. Should there be any, should there be no further questions, we humbly request your approval of this application before you. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:34:54 - 2:34:57)
Thank you so much. Alderman Hall.

[Speaker 21] (2:34:57 - 2:35:06)
Yeah, I just want to say for the record, great brother. Came, met, neighbors like him and if you ever need a car you can go to 67th and come out there.

[Speaker 1] (2:35:08 - 2:35:45)
Alright, any other questions or comments by committee members? Alright, hearing none do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderman Hall moves do pass.

Are there any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed. Thank you so much.

Thank you. Alright, so we are back on page 8, number 22240 in the 32nd Ward. This is common address 1717 to 23 North Ashland Avenue.

This is an M1-2 Limited Manufacturing Business Park District to M2-2 Light Industry District.

[Speaker 7] (2:35:47 - 2:36:00)
And we have witness Alisa Ferguson here to speak to this item. Good afternoon. My name is Alisa Ferguson.

[Speaker 2] (2:36:00 - 2:36:45)
I am the founder of Rockstar Pets and I operate at 1717 to 23 North Ashland. I've been operating 12 years in the city and this is my third location and I'm seeking a zoning change from M1-2 which is Limited Manufacturing to M2-2 Light Industry in order to continue operating outdoor activities for the dogs. So I run a training slash enrichment center.

Dogs are closely supervised. We've never had a noise complaint in 12 years. We have support of the Wicker Park and Bucktown Committee and there should be a letter from my alderman also supporting this change.

And so I humbly request that it be approved.

[Speaker 14] (2:36:46 - 2:37:30)
Great. Thank you Ms. Ferguson. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Wagusback.

Any questions by committee members? Hearing none, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderperson Fuentes moves do pass.

Any objection? Hearing none, this item is passed. Thank you.

Next up item number 22243 in the 26th Ward. Ordinance referred 91423 Document Number Common Address 911 North Mozart Document Number 02023-0004022 Common Address 911 North Mozart As a witness we have Collin Hudson.

[Speaker 6] (2:37:31 - 2:38:22)
Hi, good afternoon everyone. My name is Collin Hudson. My wife and I own the property at 911 North Mozart as well as 913 North Mozart.

911 North Mozart is a three-unit apartment building that we live in and 913 is an empty lot, full-size 25 by 125 foot city lot. We would like to ultimately be able to have the option to separate and sell the empty lot and to do so we need to change the zoning on the building at 911 North Mozart so the three-unit building can exist in its own right. So what we're requesting is a change from RT4 to RM4.5 We're not making any changes to the building, we just want the building and the lot to stand as its own individual entity versus a combined entity with the empty lot at 913 North Mozart.

[Speaker 14] (2:38:24 - 2:38:26)
Great. Other person, Fuentes?

[Speaker 20] (2:38:27 - 2:38:48)
Thank you Chair, Vice Chair. Collin Hudson and his partner have come before my advisory zoning committee twice. This has received overwhelming majority support by my advisory committee and therefore my support on being able to do the zoning change so that they can separate the parcels to sell the lot in the 26th ward.

[Speaker 14] (2:38:49 - 2:39:30)
Great. Any other questions from committee members? Hearing none do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

All the person Fuentes moves do pass. Any objections? Hearing none, this item is passed.

Thank you all. Next up, item number 22263 in the 26th ward. Ordinance referred 91423 document number 02023 dash 000 4152 with a common address of 1626 dash 1632 North California Avenue.

The change request is B3-1 Community Shopping District to B2-2 Neighborhood Mixed Use District. We have attorney Warren Silver.

[Speaker 11] (2:39:31 - 2:42:04)
Thank you Mr. Chairman, members of the committee for the record again Warren Silver, Silver Law Office PC representing the applicant and owner of the property TNF LS LLC concerning property at 1626 to 1632 North California Avenue. This is a transit serve location being 320 feet and a little change just north of North Avenue which is the North Avenue bus line border roadway segment. It's currently improved with a building that's got one, two, and three stories in different parts of it.

It's got a commercial space on the ground floor that is currently mostly vacant and it's got three dwelling units above the ground floor along with some vacant office space. There are four parking spaces currently in an enclosed area on the site. The applicant is proposing to change the zoning district to B2-2 in order to allow the building to be rehabbed to convert the office space above the ground floor into two additional dwelling units as well as to create two additional dwelling units on what's currently vacant ground floor retail space so that there would be a total of seven dwelling units on site.

It would also reconfigure the on-site enclosed parking to go from four to five parking spaces and we would keep two commercial spaces remaining on the ground floor, one of which would be the office space for the property management company that operates this and other properties and the other one would be available for rent for an office of commercial use. We've been in communication with Alder Fuentes' office, met twice with the zoning advisory committee of the community that she formed and we're pleased to report that we received support. I know that Alder Fuentes sent a letter to the committee but is here today also if there's anything that you wanted to say.

[Speaker 14] (2:42:05 - 2:42:06)
Thank you, Mr. Silver. Alder Fuentes?

[Speaker 20] (2:42:07 - 2:42:35)
Yeah, I would say that the proposers of this zoning change have come before my advisory zoning committee twice taking the feedback of all community members into the makeup of the units, the amount of bedrooms and the square footage. They so kindly took that feedback, readjusted their proposal and then came back for a second presentation in which they received overwhelming support from my zoning advisory committee. Therefore, my support in this matter.

[Speaker 14] (2:42:36 - 2:42:39)
Great. Thank you. Alderman Misbahra?

[Speaker 4] (2:42:39 - 2:43:09)
I just wanted to speak in favor of this as well. Hashtag gentle density. With all of the housing that we have lost in this area finding creative ways to add and to reintroduce density in ways that are respectful of the built environment of our community.

Really wise, really thoughtful, speaks to the really good work happening in your zoning committee. With your permission a motion do pass when it's called for.

[Speaker 14] (2:43:09 - 2:43:19)
If there's no other questions by committee members Alderman Misbahra makes a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

[Speaker 7] (2:43:20 - 2:43:24)
Thank you very much. Next item.

[Speaker 14] (2:43:27 - 2:43:58)
Item number 22276-T1 in the 25th Ward. Ordinance referred 91423 Common Address 713-715 West 19th Place Change Request RT4 Residential 2 Flat Townhouse and Multi-Unit District to B23 Neighborhood Mixed Use District. We have a substitute narrative and plans Alderman Misbahra moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type 1 application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections?

[Speaker 7] (2:43:59 - 2:44:05)
Hearing none, the substitute narrative and plans are accepted. On this item we have Ximena Castro.

[Speaker 9] (2:44:25 - 2:45:56)
Good afternoon it's 1243. Good afternoon Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Ximena Castro I'm a zoning attorney at Acosta-Esgar here with you all today for the property located at 713-715 West 19th Place The subject property is comprised of one zoning lot that includes a lot with an illegal accessory garage and a two-story residential building with five dwelling units The zoning lot is located in an equitable transit location The applicants seek to rezone the property to subdivide the lot into two individual zoning lots to allow the applicant to construct a two-story building with two units and two surface parking spaces on the vacant lot and to allow five-unit density on the existing lot The height of the new building will be 29 feet and one inch and the height of the existing building will remain The applicant will seek to reduce any required parking through the equitable transit location guidelines and as stated in the agenda we're seeking to rezone from an RT4 to a B2-3 to allow for the project to take place We have met with the alderman and his zoning advisory board. We have answered questions from the community as well, received input and we're here today with the aldermanic support which the committee has and I would appreciate your support as well Thank you so much.

[Speaker 1] (2:45:57 - 2:46:08)
Are there any questions? And before that there is substitute narrative and plan Got it We do have that before us Are there any questions or comments?

[Speaker 4] (2:46:09 - 2:46:29)
Alderman La Spada So quick, so it sounds like a great project and maybe this is just an educational question or one I should know If we're doing fully residential rather than any commercial why the B2-3 why not something more akin to like RM4.5? Do you mind if I ask?

[Speaker 9] (2:46:29 - 2:47:18)
Oh, absolutely. So the B district helps because the lot is irregular and there are a lot of requirements under the R district like your yard open space and all of those things in order to make this a more affordable type of project for Moises and his wife Francesca and their two kids who are actually the developers in the empty lot so it's this family lot is staying within the family Going to the ZBA would be very expensive under various variations and things like that. Each application is like $525 so doing a rezoning with a B district helps them achieve a project that would be more affordable.

[Speaker 4] (2:47:18 - 2:47:22)
All of that is super helpful context. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.

[Speaker 1] (2:47:22 - 2:48:13)
Thank you, Chair Thank you so much. Any other questions or comments by committee members? Hearing none, is there a motion to pass with the substitute narrative and plans by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

Alderman Fuentes moves to pass. Are there any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed with the substitute narrative and plans.

Thank you so much, Attorney Castro All right, we're moving on to number 22260-T1 in the 24th Ward. This is 3800 to 3818 West Ogden Avenue This is a C1-2 neighborhood commercial district to C1-3 commercial neighborhood district and we have Attorney Richard Baker here to speak on behalf of the Lawndale Christian Health Center Good afternoon Mr. Chairman and committee members I am Rich Baker with offices here in downtown Chicago.

[Speaker 23] (2:48:14 - 2:49:42)
I believe Alderman Scott is here so of course I will defer to her if she'd prefer to speak first off. What we're really doing in seeking a C1-2 neighborhood commercial district to change it to a C1-3 commercial neighborhood district for a very simple reason. The structure that we wish to build C1-2 only allows us 25,000 square feet.

Our proposed building is about 32,500 square feet This is particularly a three-story building. It's going to be the clinic and medical building for medical services specifically to house a residential clinic Also to expand our senior clinic and eye clinic with on-site parking. I should mention just very carefully that Lawndale has worked for about 40 years within this community We have about a five block campus now of medically related facilities and other facilities This is an addition to that campus and the reason that we're looking for the expansion beyond 25,000 square feet is twofold.

Number one, we're trying to build in on-site parking Ogden Avenue has a lot of need for parking so that is one of the reasons The second reason is to have the number of offices in order to see patients. We need to have a little larger than 25,000. For those if there are any questions, by the way, I do have Joseph Leash who is the project manager for that here.

[Speaker 1] (2:49:45 - 2:49:49)
Thank you so much. Alderwoman Scott, would you like to say some words?

[Speaker 20] (2:49:49 - 2:50:41)
Oh, sure Hey, Jo I am in support of this project Like they said, this is their residency building for to train black doctors so it's something that is needed It's something unique that they're doing and there's no parking on Ogden so we need the space Ogden is kind of like a you find a spot and you try to stay there all day so that you can get into the facility that you need so major senior senior facility right up the street like he said, they're going to do ophthalmology I mean, optometry and it just caters to our seniors and we need the space so I support it and look forward to the project

[Speaker 1] (2:50:42 - 2:51:37)
Thank you so much, Alderwoman. Are there any questions or comments from committee members? All right, hearing none do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum, Alderwoman Cruz moves do pass Are there any objections?

Hearing none, the item is passed Thank you so much Okay, moving on to page 10, number 22273 in the 23rd Ward, this is 3948 West 66th Street This is an RS2 residential single unit detached house district to a B1-1 neighborhood shopping district and we have attorney Liz Butler here to speak to this item Thank you, Chairman and members of the committee My name is Liz Butler.

[Speaker 7] (2:51:38 - 2:51:38)
I'm a partner

[Speaker 3] (2:51:38 - 2:53:40)
at the law firm of Taft, Stettinius, and Hollister located at 111 East Rocker Drive in Chicago I represent the applicant in this matter, 6545 South Pulaski, LLC, and I am joined today by Mr. Spiro Duveris on behalf of the applicant The applicant is requesting a rezoning of the subject property located at 3948 West 66th Street from the RS2 residential single unit detached house district to the B1-1 neighborhood shopping district in order to allow the construction of an accessory parking lot to serve an existing Paisan's Pizzeria and Bar that's located on the adjacent lot at 6545 South Pulaski Road This west lawn location of Paisan's opened in 2021 and has been a great success in the neighborhood and anticipating the need to serve its growing clientele, the applicant purchased the adjacent lot in order to expand its existing parking area. The subject property is approximately 5,008 square feet in size It's currently vacant and unimproved The change request is necessary to allow the combination of the two lots into a single zoning lot and the construction of the accessory parking lot to serve the restaurant which would not be allowed in the existing zoning district. The parking lot will provide approximately 13 additional parking spaces as well as landscaping and ancillary site improvements and no new structures are proposed The applicant has discussed the proposal with Alderman Tavares and has committed to a number of steps to align the proposed expansion with the best interests of the neighborhood A letter of support was provided to the committee in advance of this hearing We thank the committee for its consideration of this matter and respectfully request your favorable consideration of this zoning change and we're available to answer any questions the committee might have

[Speaker 1] (2:53:40 - 2:54:27)
Thank you so much. We have heard from Alderman Tavares. She is in support of this item Are there any questions or comments by committee members?

Hearing none, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum Alderman Burnett moves do pass Are there any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed. All right Staying on page 10 number 22268 in the 21st ward.

This is 656 West 123 Street and this is B3-1 Community Shopping District to RT4 Residential 2 Flat Townhouse and Multi-Unit District and we have Attorney Liz Butler and Brayden Lord here to speak on this item

[Speaker 3] (2:54:28 - 2:57:10)
Unfortunately, Brayden is not with me today, but again, Liz Butler on behalf of the applicant, I'm an attorney at the law firm of Taft, Stettinius and Hollister at 111 East Wacker Drive in Chicago and I represent the applicant in this matter, Habitat for Humanity Chicago I'm joined by Jason Brown, who is the construction manager for Habitat for Humanity The applicant is requesting a rezoning of the subject property located at 656 West 123rd Street from the B3-1 to the RT4 in order to allow the construction of a single family home The subject property contains approximately 3,250 square feet of site area and is currently vacant and unimproved Habitat for Humanity Chicago has been actively developing affordable and accessible homes in the West Pullman neighborhood for over 10 years Habitat acquired this site in 2022 along with the adjacent parcels, three adjacent parcels on 123rd Street in the block bounded by South Union Avenue on the west and South Low Avenue on the east Habitat is planning to construct a total of four single family homes on these lots The other three parcels are already zoned as part of the RT4 district which allows single family detached homes by right The single family detached homes are allowed in the B3-1 zoning district but require special use approval The change request will allow Habitat to proceed more rapidly with construction of the home without the need to go through that special use approval process through the Zoning Board of Appeals As with all of its homes the proposed development will be affordable and will be marketed and sold to a buyer with a household income in the 40-80% of area median income range. Habitat is also committed to preparing its purchasers for successful home ownership by providing affordable loans and extensive homeowner training and support services The change request will enable the applicant to further pursue its mission of expanding and supporting affordable home ownership in Chicago The applicant met with Alderman Mosley to share the details of the project and we understand that the Alderman is in support of the change request and we believe the Alderman communicated his support directly to the committee in advance of the hearing and know that he's here and may want to make his own remarks.

We thank the committee for its consideration of this matter and respectfully request your favorable recommendation of this request We're available to answer any questions the committee may have.

[Speaker 31] (2:57:11 - 2:58:08)
Alderman Mosley. Thank you, Mr. Chair I want to thank Habitat for being a great partner to the West Pullman community They have been an active developer of several blocks really restoring the home stock throughout our ward but also giving way to new homeowners and the 21st Ward is innately a ward that is filled with homeowners blocks by blocks and so thank you for continuing that culture, that legacy that is there and really when you hear 40% AMI that's something that no Alderman generally jumps to but really the wraparound services that Habitat provides, the education and then the support even after becoming homeowners is something that allows me to support this so thank you for the great work that you're doing This has my full support and I would motion for favorable support by the committee if my colleagues don't have any comments or questions. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:58:08 - 2:58:09)
Alderman La Spada.

[Speaker 4] (2:58:09 - 2:58:49)
I mean it's a positive comment. I'll say sir, you talked about jumping I would jump at any opportunity to create homeownership opportunities for folks at those income levels It's really, really laudable I'll say it's been a while because when I was in Boy Scouts I had an opportunity to work on a Habitat for Humanity home in New Jersey where I grew up so I really respect the work that you do If I may ask one question related to zoning, with the RT-4 zoning category is there something that is substandard about the block sizes that requires that category or why the RT-4?

[Speaker 3] (2:58:49 - 2:58:59)
The rest of the block is zoned RT-4 so it's consistent with the zoning of the rest of the block Appreciate the conformity, that makes sense to me.

[Speaker 4] (2:58:59 - 2:59:00)
Thank you. Thank you, Chair.

[Speaker 1] (2:59:00 - 3:00:29)
Thank you so much. Are there any questions or comments by committee members? If there are none Alderman Mosley moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum Are there any objections?

Hearing none, the item is passed. Thank you so much The next two items will be deferred per request of the respective alder people So this is number 22030 in the 12th Ward at 4435 Southwestern Boulevard and number 22264 in the 23rd Ward at 5210 to 5212 South Luna Avenue. Are there any questions by committee members on these deferrals?

Hearing none, the previously read two items are deferred Alright Moving on to the second item on page 11 This is number 22266 in the 13th Ward This is at 6058 West 63rd Street and this is an RS 2 Residential Single Unit Detached House District to B3-1 Community Shopping District and we have attorney

[Speaker 7] (3:00:30 - 3:00:44)
Christopher Koczwara here to speak on this item Good morning Mr. Chairman and members of the committee Good afternoon. My name is

[Speaker 16] (3:00:44 - 3:02:13)
Chris Koczwara, attorney with offices at 5838 South Archer Avenue I am appearing on behalf of the applicants Alma Torres and Beatrice Sahagan who are present here today The applicant seeks to rezone the property from an RS 2 Residential District to a B3-1 Community Shopping District The applicant purchased the property on October 18, 2017 At the time they purchased the property it was zoned B3-1 In 2018 the property was rezoned to an RS 2 District by Alderman Quinn Properties east of the subject property 6054 through 6044 West 63rd Street are zoned B3-1 Properties west of the subject property 6100 through 6124 West 63rd Street are zoned B3-1 The applicant seeks to rezone the property to the B3 District in order to operate an ice cream parlor on the first floor an apartment on the second floor The property is improved with a two-story building and with a two-car detached garage There will be no exterior changes to the building Alderman Quinn has no objection to the rezoning subject to the applicant's recording a restrictive covenant which would prohibit the sale of alcohol and cannabis to the public If the proposed amendment passes today, I will record the restrictive covenant and deliver a copy to Alderman Quinn's office today That is all I have

[Speaker 1] (3:02:13 - 3:02:21)
Thank you so much And we have heard from Alderman Quinn He is on record in support of this item Are there questions or comments by committee members?

[Speaker 4] (3:02:22 - 3:03:01)
All right Alderman LaSpata Is the restrictive covenant that you described, is that Who is the party to that? Is it DPD? Is it DACP?

It would be the owners of the property Who on the city side of things? It would run with the land So if there was going to be an enforcement the city could enforce it or the alderman's office could enforce it And I don't I'm sincerely not trying to belabor the point but a restrictive covenant is generally an agreement between two parties Who specifically is the party on the city side? Is it the alderman?

Is it the city of Chicago?

[Speaker 16] (3:03:01 - 3:03:29)
The alderman requested a restrictive covenant and it and it the property runs with the land so it was sent to the alderman's office and I understand he sent it to the zoning department who approved it but I don't believe it runs with two parties it's just a restriction on this particular land that I said I wouldn't belabor the point and I won't.

[Speaker 4] (3:03:29 - 3:03:31)
I'll find other ways to follow up Thank you, sir.

[Speaker 1] (3:03:32 - 3:04:45)

There is no change to the existing footprint and there is also a substitute narrative. We've met with Alderman Rodriguez and his Economic Development Advisory Committee and both are in support for the zoning change with Alderman Rodriguez's letter attached as part of our application.

We request your recommendation for approval Do we have any questions?

[Speaker 1] (3:05:54 - 3:05:58)
Alderman Mike Rodriguez Thank you Mr. Chair

[Speaker 24] (3:05:59 - 3:06:51)
It's a pleasure to support this endeavor not only because it's about 100 feet from my house but the fact is that we are seeing a bit of a renaissance in our community with non-profits doubling down in their investment in our neighborhood Project Vida and LASA and New Life all have new buildings and this is going to be the newest of the new buildings in our community. It's been a dilapidated structure for years It was an interesting space for a number of years but all I have to say is it's going to be turned into a community engine doing good community work Myself and my Economic Development Advisory Council are very much supportive of this endeavor Congratulations Alejo Thanks Alderman Any other questions or comments by committee members?
