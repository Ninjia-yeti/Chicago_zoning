[Speaker 1] (3:46 - 3:55)
Good morning, colleagues, we're waiting for a few more members before we start our zoning committee. So a little bit of patience would be greatly appreciated.

[Speaker 35] (3:57 - 4:05)
Good morning, Chairman. How's it up in your neighborhood on Sunday?

[Speaker 1] (4:06 - 4:07)
Looking good on Morris.

[Speaker 28] (4:08 - 4:14)
Yeah, we've hopefully got some some other things happening soon there. So excited about it.

[Speaker 1] (4:15 - 4:18)
Theater, right? That's a big, big, big win.

[Speaker 28] (4:19 - 4:20)
There's reopening.

[Speaker 1] (4:20 - 4:24)
So the puppeteers. I'm sorry.

[Speaker 28] (4:24 - 4:30)
Say that again. What is the puppeteers? Did I hear?

No, no, there's going to be magic.

[Speaker 35] (4:31 - 4:33)
Maybe that's close enough.

[Speaker 28] (4:33 - 4:36)
Cabaret and chamber music.

[Speaker 35] (4:40 - 4:43)
Culture in Rochester, of course.

[Speaker 1] (7:25 - 8:08)

Seeing none, Alderman Roboyas makes a motion to defer these previously listed items by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Second. No objections.

Hearing on these items have been deferred and colleagues, we have no public speakers sign up for today's hearing. So we're going to jump right into things starting with the addendum to the agenda. First item on the addendum is document number 02022-857, the historical landmark designation for the Ludlow Typograph Company building located at 2028-2062 North Clybourne Avenue in the Second Ward.

We have Daniel Klaber here from the Department of Planning and Development to present on this matter. Before we get to Dan, Alderman Ellison.

[Speaker 4] (13:56 - 13:58)
I want to be recognized for attendance, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (13:59 - 14:01)
You are. Thank you very much. All right, Dan.

[Speaker 15] (14:03 - 16:44)
Good morning, Chairman. I am here, but the host has disabled screen sharing. That could be.

It should be good, Daniel. Okay. You can see it okay?

Yes, sir. Great. Okay.

Thank you. Thank you, Chairman Taney. I am here today with a proposed ordinance for the designation of the Ludlow Typograph Company building as a Chicago landmark.

To help orient you, the Ludlow building is located in Chicago's Lincoln Park community area at 2028-2062 North Clybourne Avenue, just north and east of the north branch of the Chicago River. At the February meeting of the Commission on Chicago Landmarks, the Commission found that the Ludlow building met four criterion for designation, including criterion one for The Ludlow Company's contributions to the printing industry include the development of the Ludlow Typograph, a machine used for casting lines of type for setting in printing presses, as well as the creation of dozens of popular typefaces.

Criterion three for its association with two significant individuals in the printing industry, Douglas McMurtry, a nationally renowned expert on printing and typography, as well as Robert Middleton, an accomplished typographic artist. In addition, the Commission also found that the Ludlow building is significant under criterion four for architecture. The Ludlow building is a significant Prairie School-influenced commercial-style building that has a repeating layout, which made it possible for future expansion, both horizontally and vertically, as Ludlow required additional production space.

And lastly, for criterion five for architect, Alfred S. Elshuler was one of Chicago's most prominent and prolific early 20th century architects, and while he specialized in commercial and industrial architecture, he also designed a wide range of structures throughout his career, including hundreds of public buildings, synagogues, and apartment buildings. The Ludlow building is located in the Second Ward, and Alderman Hopkins has expressed his support for the proposed designation.

In addition, the building's current owner, Annexation LLC, has consented to the proposed landmark designation of the building to help facilitate its planned residential and commercial reuse. In conclusion, DPD staff recommends that the Ludlow building's significant historical and architectural features be identified as all exterior elevations, including rooflines, of the building. You have a proposed ordinance to that effect.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (16:46 - 16:50)
Thank you, Dan. Alderman Hopkins, would you like to comment on this designation?

[Speaker 29] (16:53 - 17:57)
Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm very excited we've come to this point. I think it bears mentioning that there were a number of proposals in the years prior that would have demolished this building, and we had to fight to save it.

The community had to fight to save it. We were told years ago that the nature of this particular structure didn't lend itself to an adaptive reuse. Obviously, the community didn't accept that, and we persevered and pushed through.

The narrative, the story behind it is just a remarkable tale of what the industrial use for this corridor was for many, many decades. The fact that that's going to be preserved, and granted, if you look at it, it's very utilitarian, but there is a simplistic beauty to the building, and it's certainly worth saving. This is an excellent project, and I look forward to the construction phase beginning.

So I'm in full support of this, and I would urge an aye vote from the committee. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (17:58 - 18:59)
Thank you, Brian. Any questions for my committee members? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move to pass on the same roll call that was used to determine form?

So moved. Alderman Pervoyous makes the motion. Any objections to the motion?

Hearing none, this ordinance is passed. Congratulations. Next, we have one historical landmark fee waiver, document number OR2022-67, in the ninth ward for the property located at 11114 through 1116 South Champlain Avenue.

We have no presentation on this one, but we have the Department of Planning and Development to answer any questions, and I know Alderman Beal is on the call. Questions, comments? Alderman Beal, do you want to comment on this, please?

[Speaker 32] (19:01 - 19:07)
Yeah, I'm in full support of this, Mr. Chairman, and respectfully ask the committee's favorable support as well.

[Speaker 1] (19:07 - 19:31)
Thank you very much. Any questions? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move to pass on the same roll call that was used to determine form?

Alderman Cardona has the motion. Alderman Cardona makes the motion. Any objections to the motion?

Hearing none, this item is passed. Chairman Zunich? Yes, is that Alderman Riley?

It is.

[Speaker 3] (19:31 - 19:34)
I'd just like to be recorded for purposes of roll call for the attendant.

[Speaker 1] (19:35 - 20:02)
Yes, sir. Thank you. You're on the form.

All right. Now we're moving on. We have one demolition of a non-contributing building in the 27th Ward in the Fulton Randolph Market Landmark District located at 210-218 South Aberdeen Street.

We have no presentation on this. We have the Department of Planning and Development here to answer questions. Who from the Department of Planning is going to...

[Speaker 8] (20:02 - 20:16)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman. This is Michelle Rhimes from the Department of Planning and Development. If you wish to see a presentation, I am available to share.

However, I don't... The screen sharing is disabled for me.

[Speaker 1] (20:17 - 20:19)
Do we have a picture of the building?

[Speaker 8] (20:19 - 20:23)
Yes, sir, we do. I have a full presentation for you.

[Speaker 6] (20:24 - 20:29)
Michelle, you can share your screen.

[Speaker 8] (20:29 - 20:45)
Thank you very much. Just a moment, please. Please let me know when you can see the screen.

[Speaker 1] (20:46 - 20:48)
You can see the screen now.

[Speaker 8] (20:48 - 23:34)
Thank you very much. Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, I am Michelle Rhimes, a project manager with the City of Chicago Department of Planning and Development, and I'm here today on behalf of the Commissioner on Chicago Landmarks.

We're seeking the approval of a wrecking permit application for the partial demolition of a two-story masonry commercial building located at 210-218 North Aberdeen Street. The building is located mid-block on the west side of North Aberdeen Street between West Fulton Market and West Lake Street in the Fulton-Wandolph Market District. The permit application is for the demolition of the rear non-historic western half of the Arthur Harris Building, which was originally constructed in 1904, and the existing two-story cross-gable, and to reintroduce approximately 31 feet of the one-story shingle-gable roof that was original to the building.

Additionally, the applicant will retain approximately 15 feet of the south elevation and the original roof trusses of the Arthur Harris Building and return the front facade of the building to its original design. For your information, those areas highlighted in blue on the drawings are the areas to be retained. Those in red will be demolished, and those areas in orange are outside of the landmark district.

The proposed partial demolition is part of a larger mixed-use development that includes approximately 414 residential apartments and 10,000 square feet of commercial space on the ground floor, most of which is outside of the landmark district. The Commission on Chicago Landmarks approves the proposed demolition during its January 13, 2022 meeting. Prior to the meeting, the staff received a letter of support from Alderman Walter Burnett of the 27th Ward expressing his support of the proposed partial demolition.

The Department of Planning and Development respectfully asks that this committee approve the Commission on Chicago Landmarks recommendation for the approval of the permit application for the partial demolition of the commercial building located at 210-218 North Aberdeen Street in the Fulton Randolph Market District. That's all, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (23:37 - 24:07)
Now, I know we're going to hear from Alderman Burnett and his support, but while we have this photo online, the historic one and a half story is remaining, obviously. That is correct. The, I don't know which direction it is, the closer to the train.

Is that new building, was there a sensitivity of that building being in the landmark district knowing that this is going to be saved? It was all part of a larger plan, I presume.

[Speaker 8] (24:08 - 24:45)
There has been some discussion about that. They wanted to incorporate the existing Arthur Harris building into the development. As you know, Mr. Chairman, they have to come back to the city to get permission for the demo, pardon me, for the development at each section of this project, but they've answered all of the questions to the satisfaction of the commission regarding the context of this building and the future development for the district.

[Speaker 1] (24:47 - 24:50)
The development that we see, has that already been approved?

[Speaker 8] (24:53 - 25:16)
No, not that I'm aware of. The only action that I'm aware of, oh, Cindy has her hand raised. What we do know is that they came before this committee for a zoning reclassification.

And I know this is within Cindy Rubick's district, and she can speak more to the grand development.

[Speaker 1] (25:17 - 25:25)
All right, well, before we hear from Cindy, does Alderman Burnett want to say a few words on this? Maybe he has the answers that I've asked.

[Speaker 4] (25:28 - 25:35)
I would acquiesce to Cindy. If I'm not mistaken, I think we did rezone this property.

[Speaker 40] (25:35 - 25:35)
Yes.

[Speaker 4] (25:36 - 25:56)
And I recall that the landmark building was one of the highlights in the process of rezoning, having them preserve it and do what they're going to do. So, Cindy, if Cindy could interject, I'd appreciate it. Please.

If it's okay with you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (25:56 - 26:03)
Oh, I would love to hear. I'd just like to see the integration of the new architecture with the historic building, if Cindy has a comment on that.

[Speaker 22] (26:04 - 26:44)
Yes, Chairman Tunney. Thank you, Alderman Burnett and Michelle. Cindy Rubick, for the record, I'm Deputy Commissioner with the Department of Planning and Development.

And yes, this new construction and the historic building, the entire development was reviewed and approved by Planning Commission and City Council last summer. So, definitely, it worked with the applicant and the historic preservation on incorporating the setbacks that you see with the new construction, so that it really felt like the historic building was kind of, you know, independent, could function independently, even though it is part of the overall development.

[Speaker 1] (26:46 - 26:53)
Cindy. All right. Walter, do you want to comment anymore, or do we have any questions from committee members?

[Speaker 4] (26:56 - 26:57)
No, I'm in full support.

[Speaker 1] (27:00 - 27:15)
All right. Any committee members with questions? If not, can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine form?

So moved, Alderman Haddon. Haddon makes the motion. Any objections to her motion?

[Speaker 10] (27:17 - 27:18)
Alderman Waguespack moves to pass.

[Speaker 1] (27:22 - 30:37)
Scott, put Alderman Haddon at her name for the motion. No objections. Hearing none, the order is passed.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. All right.

Moving on, we have large signs over 100 square feet in area, 24 feet above the grave. We will hear them all together, and I will read the ward, followed by the address, and take a motion at the end. We will start with the first ward, one sign located at 1341 North Palina.

Moving on to the 14th ward, two signs located at 5648 South Archer Avenue. In the 23rd ward, one sign located at 5320 South Pulaski Road. Two signs in the 27th ward located at 2934 West Lake Street.

Also in the 27th ward, one sign located in 800 West Fulton Market. Again in the 27th ward, two signs located at 1620 West Harrison Street. Moving on to the 34th ward, one sign at 801 West 119th Street.

In the 41st ward, two signs located at 838 North Patton Drive. Also in the 41st ward, one sign at 11601 West Tuey Avenue. Moving on to the 42nd ward, one sign located at 333 West Wolf Point Plaza.

More in the 42nd ward, there are four signs located at 19 South Wabash. And again in the 42nd ward, one sign located at 15 South Wabash. Lastly, in the 45th ward, one sign located at 4715 West Irving Park Road.

If no questions by committee members, do I hear a motion to move due pass by the same roll call that was used to determine form? Alderman Wagesback moves due pass. Any objections?

Hearing none, these orders are passed. We will now move on to the regular agenda in an effort to minimize technical difficulties and to ensure the committee meeting runs as smoothly as possible. The typical order in which items will be heard has been updated.

Throughout the duration of virtual committee on zoning meetings, items will be grouped together according to witness attorney and will be heard in that order rather than ward order. All right. Alderman Mannix, I believe, you are on page one of the revised agenda.

Have Alderman Hairston on the call? Yes. Good morning, Alderman.

We're reading document number A8748 in the 5th ward. Ordinances will be heard on March 23rd of 2022. Common addresses, 5600-5602 South Drexel Avenue, 5627 South Maryland Avenue, and 5635-5637 South Maryland Avenue.

And the change request from RN-5, residential multi-unit district and institutional plan development number 43 to institutional plan development number 43 as amended. Alderman Hairston.

[Speaker 33] (30:38 - 31:25)
Thank you. Good morning, committee members. I am asking for your support on this item.

It is part of a plan development that we had. It is for the University of Chicago to build their cancer center. It will be the first and only one here on the South side in the city of Chicago.

The University of Chicago services thousands of people throughout the world. And this is the direction that they think is most effective to have treatment for cancer patients here in the city. So I'm asking for the committee's support.

[Speaker 1] (31:29 - 31:35)
Alderman, I got a two-step here because we've got to incorporate the records from the planning commission first since it is a PD.

[Speaker 33] (31:35 - 31:36)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (31:37 - 32:12)
So Alderman Diehl moves to incorporate records from the planning commission by the same roll call that was used to determine form. Any objections? Hearing none, the records are incorporated.

Now on the motion on the aldermanic. Any questions for Alderman Hairston? None.

Then can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call? Mr. Chairman, Alderman Hairston. Alderman Hairston makes the motion.

Any objections to her motion? Hearing none, this item is passed as revised.

[Speaker 33] (32:13 - 32:18)
Congratulations, Leslie. Thank you all. Thank you, committee members.

Thank you, Alderman Hairston.

[Speaker 1] (32:19 - 32:26)
Moving on. We have a new, we have, is Alderman Scott with us?

[Speaker 3] (32:27 - 32:29)
He is, sir.

[Speaker 1] (32:30 - 35:26)
Hey, put on your seatbelt, Alderman. So we've got a fair amount of improvements, I should say, for your ward. So let me just start.

I'm going to read all this into the record because we are doing a series of zoning changes for a large project of affordable housing in Michael Scott's ward. So let me read it into the record. The next three items are all part of the same project and will have one presentation.

They will also have substitute ordinances as they were introduced with incorrect designations. I will read each file individually and take a motion for each after I call out the three applications first. So, aldermanic 8742 in the 24th ward for the address commonly known as 1858 South Kedzie Avenue.

The change request is B3-2 Community Shopping District to B2-1 Neighborhood Mixed Use District. Next is aldermanic 8743, also in the 24th ward for the address commonly known as 1925-1929 South Kedzie Avenue. And the change request is from a B3-2 Community Shopping District to a B2-1 Neighborhood Mixed Use District.

And lastly is aldermanic 8744 in the 24th ward for the address commonly known as 1901-1903 South Kedzie Avenue and also 1906 South Kedzie Avenue. The change request is from B3-2 Community Shopping District to B2-1 Neighborhood Mixed Use District. As stated before, the three items each have substitute ordinances.

The substitutes added the B2-1 designations for the three applications as they were introduced with an incorrect designation. Additionally, the substitute for A8744 removes the 1906 South Kedzie Avenue address so that the affected addresses are 1901-1903 South Kedzie Avenue. Let's see, any questions on that before I get a motion to accept the substitutes?

No questions, I need a motion to accept the substitutes for files A8742, A8743, and A8744 by the same roll call that was used to determine form. Alderman Roboyas makes the motion. Any objections?

Hearing none, the substitutes are finally before us. We have Brian O'Donnell from the Department of Housing on these matters and then we'll hear from Alderman Michael Scott. All right, Brian.

[Speaker 21] (35:29 - 35:32)
Screen sharing is disabled at the moment.

[Speaker 35] (35:36 - 35:41)
Good call, Brian. I was like, you're ready, Brian.

[Speaker 21] (35:53 - 38:08)
You can see my screen? All right, good morning, Chairman Tunney, Vice Chairman Roboyas, and committee members. For the record, my name is Brian O'Donnell of the Homeownership Bureau in the Department of Housing.

The department supports the proposed zoning map amendments for 1859 South Kedzie, for 1901 and 1903 South Kedzie, and for 1925 and 1929 South Kedzie. All from the existing B3-2 Community Shopping District to the proposed B2-1 Neighborhood Mixed-Use District. If approved, these amendments would allow for a ground floor residential use.

The lots under consideration are on Kedzie, south of Ogden Avenue, and a couple of blocks west and southwest of Douglas Park. The lots are in the first batch of lots to undergo site prep and remediation work in the Reclaiming Chicago efforts in North and South Lawndale. Here are the five lots shown on a zoning map of the 1800 and 1900 blocks of South Kedzie.

This is a bird's-eye view of the 1800 block of South Kedzie, aside from a church mid-block and a mixed-use building at the southwest corner of Ogden and Kedzie, the entire west side of the block is residential. Another bird's-eye view, this of the 1900 blocks of South Kedzie. Going south to the Kedzie Pink Line L Station, you can see that the lots, which are not vacant, contain multifamily residential buildings.

A similar view of the same block, highlighting 1925 and 1929 parcels. Reclaiming Chicago was an effort to build up to 1,000 new homes across the city, and the first effort to do this is taking place in the North and South Lawndale community areas. An ordinance to approve the sale of 100 lots to the joint venture between Lawndale Christian Development Corp.

and Chicago Neighborhood Initiatives was approved by City Council on October 2021. The lots under consideration today were included in the land sale ordinance. This concludes my testimony.

[Speaker 1] (38:13 - 38:16)
And Scott, would you like to comment on this ambitious project?

[Speaker 3] (38:17 - 39:24)
Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chair and members of the committee for entertaining this today. Again, like Brian said, this is the initial phase of the 1,000 homes that will be built on the north and south side of the city of Chicago with the Reclaiming Chicago program.

You know, we're going to try to... I'll be back before this body, hopefully several times, to get those 100 homes that we want to get built this year and then over the course of the next five years, you know, somewhere to 500 to 1,000 homes. This is in efforts to repopulate North Lawndale that has been losing population over the course of the last 20 years at a rapid rate.

And so creating affordable housing and vacant lots, and we have plenty of vacant lots, is what we're trying to do. And so I would ask favorable support of this so we can get this initial kickoff done. And again, we'll be back before the body of this body several times in efforts to change zoning on other pieces of land that may be in some commercial districts as well.

So again, thank you, Mr. Chair, for indulging and thank you, members of the committee and hope for a favorable passage.

[Speaker 1] (39:26 - 39:29)
Alderman Wagesback, do you have a question or comment?

[Speaker 10] (39:30 - 39:47)
Yes, Chairman, and I was just looking at the north side of 19th there, and for Alderman Scott, it looks like they had rehabbed both of those buildings. Was that in conjunction with this project, or were they trying to do that on their own and just prepare for this new zoning that you're doing?

[Speaker 3] (39:48 - 40:34)
So, no, that was done on their own. This is, again, the initial step of the—actually, this is not the initial step. If you see right on your screen currently, there are two houses that we did on Troy, which are the model homes for both the stick build and the modularly built homes, and so, again, that's the first one.

This is our second foray to get that done. The lots that you were talking about or the buildings that you were talking about were done on their own, just because, again, there is so much work going on in and around that Ogden corridor within West Southwest and with the reclaim of Chicago that, you know, folks have now started to invest in the community, and so it's just something on their own.

[Speaker 10] (40:35 - 40:44)
Yeah, they look great. I just thought maybe they had talked to you and were like, hey, we're going to take the first steps, but this sounds— it looks great. That's all I wanted to comment on.

[Speaker 41] (40:44 - 40:45)
I appreciate that.

[Speaker 10] (40:46 - 40:52)
So, Chairman, if you don't mind, I'll make that motion to pass.

[Speaker 1] (40:53 - 41:15)
I want to ask one question. I don't see other hands up, but, Michael, would you please—you talk about 500 to 1,000 homes, so what, in terms of your ward, the 24th, what kind of opportunities or sheer volume of modular homes are you looking for and over what period of time?

[Speaker 3] (41:16 - 42:54)
So, you know, the stick build and the modular homes are, from what I understand, relatively around the same price as it relates. And so it would be pretty much up to the homeowner who comes in and sees these two models and says, hey, we want to do modular or we want to do stick build. We have over 3,000 vacant lots in North Lawndale and that is city-owned.

There are a bunch of other land-bank owned lots and just folks who have bought over the dollar a lot over the course of the last couple of years when they started with Mayor Emanuel and now with this administration in terms of just—we have a large volume of empty lots. So if I could build 3,000 homes, I would do that because the city is not great tenants and they aren't great neighbors. So it is very difficult to keep those lands clean and it's very difficult to get all of that stuff done.

So if I could build 3,000, I would. But this initial, we want to do 100 and then we want to go back and I think do 100, maybe 200 at a time because we're trying to build in scale the way that you create neighborhoods because I got blocks and blocks of vacant lots to create whole blocks of new homes and get people to come into those new homes. So we'll probably be doing them at 100 at a time over the next five years.

We want to get to at least 500 and if it is working and it's doing what we need to do, hopefully 1,000.

[Speaker 1] (42:56 - 43:05)
Very ambitious and I appreciate it. So does our colleagues, I'm sure. With that, Alderman Bernad has his hand up.

Walter?

[Speaker 4] (43:07 - 43:23)
First of all, I want to commend the Department of Housing and definitely Alderman Scott for all his great work. I just have a question. Who is the modular company that you're dealing with?

Is that Josh?

[Speaker 40] (43:23 - 43:24)
Yeah, it's Kinect.

[Speaker 4] (43:26 - 43:28)
It's Kinect. So who's doing the stick building?

[Speaker 3] (43:28 - 43:42)
The stick build is being done by Lawndale Christian Development Corporation and CNI. They're the developer so they'll be doing the work as it relates to the stick builds.

[Speaker 4] (43:43 - 44:02)
Yeah, so I just went to see Josh maybe two, three weeks ago and he was telling me because of construction costs his price had to go up. I guess everybody going through that. How does that, and I'm sure that relates the same way to the stick build.

Are they about the same price to get built?

[Speaker 3] (44:02 - 44:37)
At the last, I'm going to have to again meet with LCBC but at last time and I talked to them about a month, month and a half ago, they were still kind of paralleling at the same price and the modular home is a little bit bigger than the stick build. They don't look like it but it is and so I will get that answer for you Alderman, but I believe at my last meeting with them they were about the same price.

[Speaker 4] (44:37 - 45:04)
Yeah, because Josh was telling me it's about $40,000 more $40,000 because of construction costs I mean material costs and the supply line so everything is supply chain and everything is going up so yes, that is the case. Alright, so who pays for this? Do this come out of so this money so you've given them a lot Mike they get their own funding or there's some funding coming from housing?

[Speaker 3] (45:04 - 46:58)
So it's been really interesting how this came together so we gave them the land and what we did is went into TIFF and made the lands pad ready because if you have to go in and you have to do environmental it just raises the price on the homes and so we made it pad ready. They've gone out and raised quite a bit of money I think to the tune of about $10 million and counting and I may be off and then they've gone to the state and the state has given up some money for subsidies and so you mix all of what we've done with the money that they've raised then you get to a price where it is affordable and so what we're trying to do is keep these houses under $250,000 for an individual who's buying and many people might not say that's not affordable but 3-4 bedrooms brand new house from the ground with subsidies gets you to about that price and so it has been a hodgepodge of putting these pieces together and I really have to commend the Reclaim Chicago folks and LCD and CNI and the work that they've done to one raise this money but two get people who are in the neighborhood ready they've gone through this program where they get folks and make sure that their credit is ready and make sure that they have the down payment and get everybody ready so that when these houses are built folks can go right in there and so they've done a really good job of making this happen and so I want to applaud them for all the work that they've done and also like you said the Department of Housing has been a real champion of affordable housing especially here in Mott Ward so I would really like to commend them yep I just got a text from Richard Townsend who's on the line he said the stick build and the modular will be the same price

[Speaker 4] (47:00 - 47:02)
same price to build

[Speaker 3] (47:02 - 47:08)
yep same price to build and the same price we're going to try to sell them both at under $250,000

[Speaker 4] (47:10 - 47:12)
fantastic congratulations good job everybody

[Speaker 1] (47:13 - 47:30)
any more questions comments otherwise Alderman Wagesbeck makes a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used in the term and form any objections to his motion hearing none and these items are passed congratulations again Michael

[Speaker 31] (47:30 - 47:31)

[Speaker 1] (47:31 - 47:44)

[Speaker 1] (47:48 - 48:39)
alrighty alright now uh page 2 in the 32nd ward Aldermanic 8745 the ordinance was referred on March 23rd of 2022 common address 2550 North Milwaukee Avenue also 3131 West Logan Boulevard and the change request from a B33 community shopping district to a POS-2 parks and open space district Alderman Wagesbeck and can we read both of these in at the same time?

ok we'll keep these separate even though it's part of the major project Scott do you want to talk on first Milwaukee and Logan please?

[Speaker 10] (48:40 - 49:20)
years we as a committee made changes to what was the old Megamall site many years ago it has a new development on it called Logan Crossing basically this parcel is going to be redesigned as a park space to tie together to Logan the monument there and create a more 24 hour flow of pedestrians being able to walk there going north and south preliminary plans on this site would call for landscaping and natural seating elements for the community so I would ask the committee's favorable support of this item

[Speaker 1] (49:21 - 49:32)
thank you Scott I think in my briefing I had a photo of this thing do we have anybody from the department to share the screen on this one? Cindy?

[Speaker 22] (49:33 - 49:49)

[Speaker 10] (50:37 - 51:32)
and Chairman on the south parcel there for Sacramento and Milwaukee this was being used as a storage and parking area by a nearby motor vehicle repair shop we were able to get a cease and desist noticed against the business and working with Department of Law DPD and what we expect there is working with the community groups Logan Square Neighborhood Association Logan Square Preservation getting something in the short duration like food trucks, landscape elements and we're allowing people to continue to use that site for what it was hopefully originally intended and then we have AAS checking on environmental issues if there are any on both sites and that would be the same for the second item this would be the second item thanks

[Speaker 1] (51:34 - 53:08)
great adaptive reuse first of all we're going to take a vote if there's no questions on the Milwaukee Logan and then I will introduce the Sacramento one and then we can get either a question or a vote separately on that one so on the 8745 Milwaukee and Logan questions, comments, otherwise can I get a motion to move do pass by the same vote in the future determined form so moved Mr. Chairman Vice Chair Raboyas makes the motion any objections to his motion second hearing on the items passed now I'm going to read the second half of this presentation into the record that's document number 8746 again 32nd Ward ordinance was deferred on March 23, 2022 cabin address is 2420 North Sacramento and this change request is from a C22 motor vehicle related commercial district to POS2 parks and open space district the presentation was made Alderman Bogusak talked about both of them any questions on the Sacramento portion of this ordinance hearing none can I get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used in the determined form so moved by Alderman Cardona Alderman Cardona makes the motion any objections to the motion hearing none this item is passed I just Scott I also heard you might have food trucks over there

[Speaker 5] (53:57 - 55:39)
good morning chairman Tunney and members of the committee for the record my name is Sylvia Mikus an attorney with the Taft Law Firm and here with me today is Angela Laskaris manager of the applicant 1912 Division LLC which is also the owner of the subject property also present and available for questions is our project architect Rick Whitney of Fitzgerald Architects first we would like to thank and acknowledge Alderman LaSpada for his support of applicants proposed mixed-use building at the subject property next slide please the subject property as reflected in the red highlighted area contains 3280 square feet it fronts onto Division Street and is currently vacant and unimproved the subject property is located on a pedestrian street and located within 2100 feet of the blue line CTA station at Division in Milwaukee next slide please the applicant seeks to develop the subject property with a new 4 story mixed-use building containing retail space and a total of 7 dwelling units since the filing of applicants original type 1 zoning amendment application the applicants plans were revised to reflect a decrease in the proposed retail square footage from the original proposed 1400 square feet to 898 square feet at this time I would like to incorporate applicants substitute narrative and plans into the record

[Speaker 1] (55:41 - 55:57)
so Alderman Ravois moves to accept the substantive narrative plans for the type 1 application by the same roll call that was used to determine any objections hearing on the substantive narrative plans are accepted and would you continue please

[Speaker 5] (55:57 - 57:33)
thank you the applicants proposed mixed-use building will contain 898 square feet of retail space at the front of the first floor one ADA accessible residential unit located at the rear of the first floor and two residential units on each of the second, third and fourth floors the existing utility facilities and easement located at the rear of the property prevent alley access for on-site parking as the property is a transit-served location, the applicant is seeking to waive the seven required residential parking spaces as part of its type 1 zoning amendment application in keeping with the transit-oriented friendly development, the proposed mixed-use building will include a bike room which will contain space for seven bike spaces in order to permit applicants proposed mixed-use building the applicant is seeking a zoning amendment from the existing RT4 district and B3-2 district to a B2-3 district the applicant has met with and showed its plans to his adjacent neighbors located directly to the east and west and they have no objection next slide please as stated previously, the applicant has worked with and received the support of Alderman LaSpada of which I believe the committee on zoning has a copy of his letter of support, this concludes our presentation, we are available for any questions

[Speaker 16] (57:37 - 57:40)
Mr. Chairman, I have a quick comment

[Speaker 1] (57:40 - 57:43)
Hi, Alderman Roboy is on the call

[Speaker 16] (57:43 - 57:48)
I just want to clarify for the record Is that LaSpada on the bicycle?

[Speaker 1] (57:54 - 58:13)
I think he's trying to get to our meeting My question Sylvia is talk to me about the easement and the lack of parking, I understand there's no parking and it's proximity to the rail station but what is on that easement? What's going on in the back?

[Speaker 5] (58:13 - 59:34)
Basically there's utility existing utility Ameritech facilities with poles and also there's an easement that restricts anyone from accessing that particular area is my understanding of that easement and that's why there's the inability to have parking in that particular area The only way in order to access that in order to establish parking, so while the easement does not restrict parking the access to that parking would only be able to happen from by establishing a curb cut off of West Division then that would which is not supported because it is a pedestrian street but my understanding given with the poles and the actual easement itself with Ameritech it would be difficult to provide the on-site parking as there would be no alley access to those parking spaces If you want further clarification, I know my client has additional information and I'm happy

[Speaker 1] (59:36 - 59:39)
Neighbors on both sides are fine

[Speaker 5] (59:41 - 59:46)
We met with them and showed them our plans and they're both they have no objection

[Speaker 2] (1:04:19 - 1:05:20)
to us about it? Yes, good morning again I'm Nick Batikas for the record I'm here on behalf of the applicant in all three of these cases Center Court Development LLC and the program that's being presented to the board today is the development of three vacant lots on the 5400 block of South Dearborn Each lot will be developed with a new three-story, two-unit residential building Each of the buildings will be masonry and construction and measure 38 feet in height and there will be two cars two parking spaces at the rear of each lot, so one-to-one parking is maintained. The applicant in this case Mr. Kamau Murray worked directly with Alderman Dowell We do have letters of support for all three matters on file, but I also believe the Alderman is on the call as well, and I'd be happy to yield the floor to her for further comment Thank you, Nick Alderman Dowell, would you comment on South Dearborn, please?

[Speaker 31] (1:05:20 - 1:06:09)
Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman When Excess Tennis Village which is at 53rd and State Street was constructed in 2018 it was one of the largest indoor and outdoor tennis facilities in the United States and on the south side of Chicago One of the goals of my hope at that time would be that this development would spur development around the tennis facility and this has happened now and I support center court development in their efforts to construct residential buildings adjacent to the Excess Tennis Village and I ask for the committee's support for this effort

[Speaker 1] (1:06:11 - 1:07:22)
Thank you Alderman Dowell, questions, comments? Before I get a motion, I wanted to congratulate you I know how hard you've worked on that tennis center and the appropriate economic development around it so this is a legacy project for you, I know that for sure All right, questions, comments?

Alderman Wagesbeck What, am I going to read all three files? I'm going to read the three addresses, file numbers and then I'll take one motion that Alderman Wagesbeck will move this committee Let me read the file numbers File number 20984 File number 20983 and file number 2082 I'm sorry 20982, 20983 and 20984 All located on the 5400 block of South Dearborn Alderman Wagesbeck makes the motion to move to pass the same roll call that was used to determine form, any objections to the motion? Hearing none, these items are passed

[Speaker 31] (1:07:22 - 1:07:27)
Thank you Mr. Chairman, and thank you Mr. Fitzgibbon Thank you Alderman

[Speaker 1] (1:07:29 - 1:07:59)
Now we're on page 4 document number 20980 in the 7th ward Ordinance was referred on March 23rd of 2022 Common address is 9319 South Merrill Avenue Change request from an RS2 residential single unit detached house district to an RS3 residential single unit detached house district Nick Fitikas again

[Speaker 2] (1:07:59 - 1:09:06)
Thank you Chairman again Director Nick Fitikas from the Law Offices of Sam Banks I'm here on behalf of the applicant and property owners concerning the subject property at 9319 South Merrill The subject property is currently improved with a residential building and it's currently zoned RS2 My clients are proposing to take down the existing building and legally divide the single zoning lot into two developable lots Each lot would have one new single family home containing approximately 2300 square feet of living space Each of the two new homes will also be 27 feet in height and have two garage parking spaces located at the rear So a zoning change to the RS3 is required in this case to allow the lot division and ultimately the two single family homes to be developed.

We worked directly with Alderman Mitchell on this proposal I did forward staff an email with Alderman Mitchell's support I believe staff at your office also confirmed the Alderman's support for the program so I just wanted to make sure that was in order

[Speaker 1] (1:09:08 - 1:09:16)
We have received We have received approval from Alderman Mitchell support

[Speaker 2] (1:09:18 - 1:09:25)
And Chairman that concludes the presentation I'd be happy to answer your questions you or the committee members might have

[Speaker 1] (1:09:26 - 1:09:27)
What's the size of the lot

[Speaker 2] (1:09:27 - 1:09:39)
Nick? So currently it's a 50 by 125 lot and it would be divided into two 25 foot wide lots so it would be a typical or standard lot resulting

[Speaker 1] (1:09:42 - 1:10:32)
Any other comments, questions Again we do have support from Alderman Mitchell Can I get a motion to move to pass on the same roll call that was used in the determined form Oh no, Nick, I don't know Motion Any objections to his motion Hearing none The item is passed All right Nick, stay on, we've got another item It's 20981 in the 24th ward, ordinances referred on March 23, 2022 Common address is 3801-3803 West Roosevelt Road And the change request B32 Community Shopping District and RT4 Residential 2 Townhouse and Multi-Unit District All to a B32 Community Shopping District Nick West Roosevelt

[Speaker 2] (1:10:32 - 1:11:35)
Thank you again for the record, Nick Fatikas from the Law Offices of Sam Banks I'm here on behalf of the applicant and property owner 3803 Roosevelt LLC The subject property contains 23,700 square feet of lot area It's actually currently improved with an operating gas station and accessory retail convenience store The applicant was proposing or attempting to obtain a permit to expand the retail store and a split zoning lot issue was raised The southern portion of the lot, about 25 feet, is zoned RT4. So in order to establish a uniform zoning district so that the applicant can move forward with the retail store expansion, we're seeking a zoning change again to a uniform B3-2 zoning district We did meet directly with Alderman Scott We had a Zoom meeting with his office to explain the issue and I believe the Alderman already provided a letter of support that should be on file with your office

[Speaker 1] (1:11:39 - 1:12:30)
We do have the support of Alderman Scott for the record.

Any questions, comments from committee members? If not, Alderman Vice Chair Raboyas makes the motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used in the term and form Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the item is passed Alright Let's see, top of page 5 Document number 20989-T1 in the 26th Ward Ordinance was referred on March 23rd of 2022 The common address is 2117 West Grand Avenue and the change request from C3-1 Commercial Manufacturing and Employment District to C2-1 Motor Vehicle Related Commercial District.

[Speaker 2] (1:12:31 - 1:13:27)
Nick Fatikas again And again, Chairman For the record, Nick Fatikas on behalf of the Applicant and Proprietor Icarus Investments Group LLC Chairman, before we move forward with the presentation, there is a Substitute Ordinance and Substitute Narrative and Plan Set for this application. I'd like to ask that the Substitute Ordinance, Narrative and Plan Set be incorporated into today's proceeding. I'd also point out that the existing zoning is actually C3-2 not C3-1 That was a mistake made by my office when we initially filed the application We caught the error prior to sending out notice, notified your office as well as DPD and were able to resolve that issue prior to today's hearing.

So I do want to make sure that change is part of the record today Okay Move on to Substitute Narrative, Mr. Chairman Okay, we got two motions, right?

[Speaker 1] (1:13:28 - 1:14:04)
So, Alderman Ravois moves to accept the Substitute Narrative and Plans for the Type 1 application by the same roll call that was used to determine form Any objections to that? Hearing none, the Substitute Narrative and Plans are accepted And then Alderman Ravois moves to accept the Substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine form This is the mistake, right? C3-1 The correct The correct C3-2 And we're referring it to C2-1

[Speaker 2] (1:14:05 - 1:14:16)
We're still changing it to C2-1 but we wanted to make sure that the existing zoning was correctly noticed and that was done The correct existing zoning is C3-2

[Speaker 1] (1:14:18 - 1:14:35)
Alrighty So that's the motion I'm asking right now That's part of it Alright, so Alderman Ravois moves to accept the Substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine form Any objections to that? Hearing none, the Substitute, everything is in progress

[Speaker 2] (1:14:36 - 1:15:36)
Alright I'm sorry for that Let's talk about the project now So, we're actually proposing The applicant is proposing to bring the existing mixed-use building in compliance with the zoning ordinance The ground floor retail unit and second floor residential unit will remain in their current condition There are no changes physically proposed to the building The applicant is actually attempting to obtain a mortgage as a owner-occupied building because this is intended to be the residential unit is intended to be occupied by the owners and an issue was raised during the review because the current zoning doesn't allow for any residential uses So in working with Alderman Maldonado's office we agreed again to a type 1 zoning change and I think it's also mandatory in this case, but this is a type 1 zoning change to simply keep or bring the existing mixed-use building into full compliance with the ordinance Alright

[Speaker 1] (1:15:36 - 1:15:40)
So we're not really doing anything to the building other than trying to get a mortgage for the owners?

[Speaker 2] (1:15:41 - 1:16:09)
That is it. There are no changes proposed Part of that is also secured by the fact that this is a type 1 change, so if any other expansions are proposed in the future we'd have to come back before the committee and the Alderman before doing so And do we have your letter of support from Alderman Maldonado? Yes, you should already have the letter of support that was provided a few weeks back to Nicole Would you re-send it, please?

[Speaker 1] (1:16:10 - 1:17:16)
No, no, I'll send it right now Alright Questions, comments from committee members? None Can I get a motion to move, do pass by the same roll call that was used in the adjournment forum? Move to pass Alderman Wagenstad Alderman Wagenstad makes the motion and any objections to that?

Again, we do have support from Alderman Maldonado No Objections? This item is passed with a substantive narrative and plans As amended Alright, don't bring those complex things to me anymore Alright Let's go on to the middle of page 5 We're at document number 20974 in the 30th ward Ordinance was referred on March 23, 2022 Common address 3735 West Belmont Avenue and the change request from the C-12 Neighborhood Commercial District to B-33 Community Shopping District Again, we have Nick Fatikas on the call

[Speaker 2] (1:17:17 - 1:18:13)
And again, Chairman, for the record, Nick Fatikas I'm here on behalf of the applicant and property owner In this case, we are proposing to develop the subject property which contains about 8,125 square feet of total lot area with a new four-story mixed-use building. The first floor of the new building will have about 1,625 square feet of retail space and then a total of 12 residential units above The building will also be supported by a total of 15 off-street parking spaces. We are seeking a zoning change to permit the proposed FAR as well as the total unit count on the subject lot We work directly with Alderman Raboyas We participated in an open community meeting led by the Alderman and I believe a letter of support is already on file However, I also know that the Alderman's on today's call and I'd be happy to yield the floor to him for further comment

[Speaker 1] (1:18:15 - 1:18:18)
Alright, Vice-Chair Raboyas, on the Belmont application please.

[Speaker 16] (1:18:18 - 1:18:48)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman Moving on with the Nick Fatikas Zoning Committee Mr. Chairman Members of the Zoning Committee, a meeting was held on January 13, 2022 to introduce a new four-story mixed-use development at 3735 West Belmont The meeting was overwhelmingly approved If there are no questions, Mr. Chairman, I ask for a favorable support from the committee on this matter before me

Absolutely Mr. Chairman Mr. Chairman These are three projects that I've been working with Metro on for a little while and I think these will be great improvements to the metro stations to try to get ridership up and active on the south side Ridership has been lagging and I think these improvements will help attract people back to the metro stations in order to get downtown in a timely manner So I respectfully ask the support of the members of this committee

Alright Ms. Castro Let's talk about the 45th ward on Lawrence Avenue

[Speaker 30] (1:34:15 - 1:35:14)
Good afternoon Good afternoon Chairman and members of the committee My name is Ximena Castro I'm a Zoning Attorney at Acosta-Esquer here before you today on behalf of the applicant for the property at 5016 West Lawrence Avenue We're seeking to rezone the property from a C11 to an RT4 to allow the legalization of the building to have the building has 4 units we're simply rezoning it to allow those units to exist there legally and we also have a letter of support I believe from the Alderman's office and I also believe they may be on as well and we also are seeking to work with the Alderman's office for them to rezone the property back after we secure permits for the property

[Speaker 1] (1:35:16 - 1:35:27)
Alright for the record Gardner is supporting this as long as there's a down zoning application Do we have someone from Alderman Gardner's office on the call?

[Speaker 39] (1:35:28 - 1:35:47)
Yes This is Marie from Alderman Gardner's office and the office and Alderman Gardner are in support of this as long as it does go back to C11 which we will coordinate with Alright, thank you very much Any questions or comments from committee members?

[Speaker 1] (1:35:48 - 1:36:43)
Hearing none can I get a motion to move to pass for the same roll call that was used to determine form Vice Chair Ramoyz makes the motion, any objections to his motion? Hearing none this item is passed Alright, thanks Ms. Castro Okay Alright I gotta go back to the bottom of page 7 I forgot this item and it's number 20965 in the 23rd Ward on March 23rd of 2022, common address is 7050 West 63rd Street and the change request plan development number 1010 to C22 Motor Vehicle Related Commercial District We have Noah Hammett I think I pronounced it correctly Noah?

[Speaker 20] (1:36:44 - 1:38:12)
Hi, good afternoon committee members you did pronounce that correctly My name is Noah Hammett I'm here representing 560 South Vermont LLC and here with me are representing the applicant an affiliate of the applicant Richard's Building Supply are Ryan Guzior, the Real Estate Manager and William Swanson, the Senior Vice President We are respectfully requesting that the property at 7050 West 63rd Street in the clearing neighborhood be rezoned from PD 1010 to C22 The property was rezoned to the plan development back in approximately 2006 but the residential development that was planned for the property was never initiated and instead the restaurant that is currently the building for the restaurant is still on the property continued to operate up until last year when it went vacant The applicant requests a rezoning to C22 in order to comply with the current Chicago zoning ordinance and find a tenant to reoccupy the building and also to use the back portion of the property for extra storage for the adjacent property owner which is Richard's Building Supply Company and also to later apply for a special use permit for storage of vehicles on that back portion of the property

[Speaker 1] (1:38:16 - 1:38:34)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Tavares questions from committee members to myself tell me how big is this property to begin with that was in a plan development

[Speaker 20] (1:38:34 - 1:38:42)
It's approximately 50,000 square feet the building is about 5,500 square feet of that

[Speaker 1] (1:38:42 - 1:39:01)
Ok so that that plan development that restaurant that's all gone right so this applicant would like to I'm assuming it's a very large parking lot with 5,000 square feet of restaurant

[Speaker 41] (1:39:02 - 1:39:04)
Yes that's exactly right

[Speaker 1] (1:39:04 - 1:39:14)
So what does the new owner which seems to be an adjacent commercial use what do they want to do with this large property

[Speaker 20] (1:39:15 - 1:39:47)
So the building that is currently on the property would remain unchanged and be occupied by either a restaurant or a retail tenant and then just the back portion of the property which is a large parking lot would be used for additional storage for the company that's adjacent to it which is Richards Building Supply Company It would be used primarily for the storage of shingles and as I mentioned we would also be applying for a special use permit later for the storage of trucks at the property

[Speaker 1] (1:39:48 - 1:40:07)
Ok so what we're effectuating today is the change from plan development number 1010 to a C22 which would allow what you're saying with the additional special use application and approval with especially the storage of trucks and such

[Speaker 20] (1:40:07 - 1:40:08)
Yes that's correct

[Speaker 1] (1:40:10 - 1:41:03)

Number 20973 36th Ward Ordinances occurred on March 23, 2022 Common address is 6708 West Belmont Avenue Change request from a B1-1 Neighborhood Shopping District to a B3-2 Community Shopping District The witness we have is Melada Groove-Nova

[Speaker 40] (1:43:50 - 1:43:51)
Groove-Nova

Close If Melada is anywhere, can we get her hand raised so we can identify her and get her testimony Ok, we're going to hold this until the end 36th Ward Now I'm going to ask my Vice Chair Roboyas to take over the two items that are in the infamous 44th Ward

[Speaker 16] (1:44:22 - 1:44:27)
Thank you Mr. Chairman We have two items in the 44th Ward

[Speaker 1] (1:44:27 - 1:44:41)
Hold on, we now have Melada, so after we're going to continue in the 44th Ward and then we'll go back to the 36th Ward Vice Chair Roboyas, the floor Thank you

[Speaker 16] (1:44:42 - 1:45:17)
Yes Mr. Chairman, we have two cases in the 44th Ward The first one is file number 20990 which was referred on March 23, 2022 for the common address known as 1457 West Roscoe Street The change request is RT3.5 Residential Two Flat Townhouse and Multi Unit District and RM 4.5 Residential Multi Unit District We have Thomas Moore, I hope, on the line He can speak on the matter

[Speaker 12] (1:45:18 - 1:46:12)
Yes, thank you Alderman Roboyas This is an existing four or five unit non-conforming building that's lot line to lot line The applicant wants to do a much It's going to be R4 building in every way except for the FAR and it will only be a three unit building and be much more family friendly and they'll get rid of the existing curb cut so the Alderman Tunney had a Zoom community meeting and we're aware of no objections to this and we have the support of the Alderman and we request your support as well

[Speaker 16] (1:46:13 - 1:46:17)
Thank you Mr. Moore Alderman Tunney, would you like to speak on the matter before us?

[Speaker 1] (1:46:18 - 1:46:54)
Mr. Chair, as Mr. Moore stated we've made outreach to West Lakeview no objections corner lot it's four or five units in very much need of a tear down and rebuild so less units, no curb cut, corner lot I think it's appropriate use for this site and I am in support of the zoning change to do it and then I would say on the record Mr. Moore will have to go back and once the permits are there and rezone it back to the original zone

[Speaker 16] (1:46:54 - 1:47:41)
Are there any questions on the matter before us? If there are no questions Alderman Padden makes a motion to do pass the same roll call that was used to determine quorum are there any objectors?

Hearing none, the item is passed. Moving on to the 44th ward once again we'll stay with Thomas Moore for another item in the 44th file number 20976 which was referred on March 23rd, 2022 for the address commonly known as 3221 North Clark Street the change request is a B1-3 Neighborhood Shopping District to a C1-3 Neighborhood Commercial District Mr. Moore

[Speaker 12] (1:47:41 - 1:49:10)
Thank you Mr. Chairman and members of the committee this is an existing building it's gone through many iterations over its history it was a restaurant at one point and it's vacant now a very interesting lady who came to Chicago from the out west to work at Second City and to supplement her income she started walking dogs and over the years that turned into actually taking care of dogs and she has a facility in Old Town but it's inadequate for her customers and so she found this property and is going to have a dog place where you can abort a dog overnight or over the weekend and will have a dog care facility it happens to be right next to an animal hospital which should also be convenient to allow the overnight boarding of dogs we have requested a C1-3 and we're aware of no opposition and we have the ultimate support and we request your support as well

[Speaker 16] (1:49:10 - 1:49:13)
Thank you sir. Chairman Tunney would you like to speak on the matter?

[Speaker 1] (1:49:15 - 1:49:40)
Yes in support of they have met with the property owners they're ok with it and this is right next to Blum Animal Hospital so I think it's an appropriate use to have the overnight storage and daycare such that this zoning change would allow so I would hope my committee supports me on this one

[Speaker 16] (1:49:40 - 1:49:55)
Thank you if there are no questions Alderman Cardona makes a motion The motion do pass the same roll call use the current quorum Are there any objections? Hearing none the item is passed Thank you Mr. Chairman

[Speaker 1] (1:49:55 - 1:50:33)
Thank you Staying on page 9 up at the top the one we just read into the record I'll read again 20973 36th Ward Ordinance was referred on March 23, 2022 Common address 6708 West Belmont Avenue The change request V11 Neighborhood Shopping District to V32 Community Shopping District So let me try it again Nolada Krugnova is the witness would you like to identify yourself and repeat your name so I won't mispronounce it again

[Speaker 35] (1:50:35 - 1:50:43)
Hi this is Nolada I'm here Nolada Krugnova from the 6710-12 West Belmont Ok

[Speaker 1] (1:50:46 - 1:50:47)
Proceed

[Speaker 17] (1:50:49 - 1:51:54)
My name is Rick Trankle and I help Nolada manage her restaurant at 6710-12 Belmont and they purchased the building next door which was a mixed use building storefront with two dwelling units the dwelling units are to remain but the purpose of the expansion was to provide just additional storage and office use for her restaurant business which is growing here and she's been in business for 25 years and has quite a reputation for hosting family events parties of all kinds birthdays all kinds of celebrations so to match the zoning that she has right now which is B3-2 is what she wishes to do to convert which used to be for many years just a trophy shop next door at 6708 Alright

[Speaker 1] (1:51:55 - 1:52:14)
Cafe Frog it looks like my staff is alerting me to the site I just have a question this is all one building right you're not connecting two buildings is that correct just within the confines so to speak

[Speaker 17] (1:52:15 - 1:53:05)
we are connecting the two buildings the buildings are only separated by one wall the intent is to break through that wall on our side and provide that additional seating for the restaurant alright no bar or anything like that because all of those licenses are on this side of course they would have to be expanded to serve on the other side but there's no restaurant or all the kitchen and everything for providing that service is on the existing site so this is just basically for additional seating space for the growing party business and office

[Speaker 1] (1:53:05 - 1:53:10)
what do we have for parking in the back

[Speaker 17] (1:53:10 - 1:53:43)
is really space only just for two cars on our on the restaurant side it's the same thing 67-12 there's the owner and her husband park back there and on that new building there would be just room for two spaces there so it might be additional for the tenants or something like that yes he wrote us a very nice letter supporting this expansion which was

[Speaker 1] (1:53:43 - 1:54:42)
my staff says that he has entered that to our committee so any other questions comments before we take a motion and I know we'll support this restaurant just a word of advice if you're connecting two buildings rather than one building tearing down a wall you might want to make sure you have the separations and the fire separations in the building department it is not as easy as blowing through a wall and trust me I've been through this and it was a nightmare with that being said let's get the zoning on this thing to allow for the expansion of the restaurant any other comments or questions vice chair makes the motion to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum any objections to that

[Speaker 6] (1:54:42 - 1:54:46)
we heard an objection

[Speaker 1] (1:54:47 - 1:55:27)

I'm Corrine O'Hara and I am a member of LLC and was the actual owner of the property and my husband and I are the only members of LLC Emmett and I have owned 3528 North Ashland since 1999 we utilized it as our law office before and when we retired from the practice of law we basically had a vacant office for a long period of time there is one residential unit upstairs for quite a while the Lashes Chicago Lashes rented from us and also a psychologist and then another therapist over the years after COVID however everybody left so I have an office building in which I currently use one small office the tenant upstairs cannot afford his rent and so I thought this was then the perfect time to raise the building and then rebuild with one commercial unit and three residential units above it the size of the lot being 2,702 square feet is just shy of the required amount to meet the floor area ratio which is why I need to go from C12 to C13 I have the presentation that I gave to the members of the Lakeview committees as well as a letter of support from the Alderman which is Alderman Martin I have we are adding the changes that they requested, commercial bikes bike spaces, electric charging and residential bike parking spot excuse me, bike spaces for everybody and there will be parking in the back one for each residential unit

[Speaker 40] (2:03:11 - 2:03:12)
Let's talk about Western

[Speaker 9] (2:03:13 - 2:06:34)
Deal With that, thank you everybody I really do miss you all Hopefully we'll be back in the same chamber soon Until then, for the record My name is Sarah Barnes and I'm an attorney with the Law Offices of Sam Banks I'm happy to be here this afternoon on behalf of the applicants 4137 and 4139 Western LLC which are owned and managed by the two Khan brothers, Azim and Rahim who coincidentally not only own the subject properties but they currently have their real estate offices in the ground floor of one of the two three-story buildings that we are here today seeking to replace The reason they are relocating that office still staying within the 47th home within which they both also reside but moving to a more commercially dense part of the neighborhood because believe it or not although this block of Western Avenue is predominantly zoned business and commercial over 70% of the improvements on this side of the block on that section of Western Avenue are all residential in character and nature many of them are apartment buildings but because this is also a transit-served location so in an effort to remain more compatible with the existing uses on that particular block but to also satisfy a need for more owner-occupied larger family dwelling units in the 47th Ward we worked with Alderman Martin as well as his 47th Ward Zoning Advisory Committee and the North Center Neighborhood Association and the North Center Chamber of Commerce towards some programming for the subject site which calls for the construction of a new four-story eight-unit residential condominium building which would even though this is a transit-served location in response to a lot of the feedback that we got from the community members we're still going to provide one-to-one parking for each of the units because there does seem to be a little bit of a parking deficiency in that particular part of the neighborhood so the building will feature four interior parking spaces in the basement of the proposed new building and four surface parking spaces again we had pretty robust community engagement throughout this process as well as some incredible feedback and personal work on behalf of Alderman Martin and his staff and I am happy to report to the committee that we do have the unanimous support of all of the community organizations who have each provided letters as well as Alderman Martin who himself has tendered a copy of a letter of support to the committee so with that I'm happy to answer any questions and we just respectfully request the favorable determination of this board

[Speaker 1] (2:06:35 - 2:06:57)
committee excuse me we've got a letter of support from Alderman Martin any questions comments from committee members hearing none can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum the woman ahead makes the motion any objections to her motion hearing none the item is passed.

[Speaker 9] (2:06:58 - 2:07:01)
Thanks everyone have a great day

[Speaker 1] (2:07:01 - 2:07:34)

[Speaker 1] (2:08:29 - 2:08:38)
we're going to hear from the Alderwoman herself Maria would you like to speak on the application on West Morse

[Speaker 28] (2:08:38 - 2:09:30)
sure thanks chair and hi Ilya so you know like Mr. Pisarenko said this is a property that he acquired that was in pretty bad shape we're looking forward to getting that burnt out coach house demolished neighbors are looking forward to that Ilya and his architect met several times with us with neighbors we had a couple community meetings including some on site as we look to figure out the best use and what was possible with this project Ilya I appreciate your time I know we looked at a few different solutions we were hindered by some of the zoning pieces but ultimately I definitely support this and this is what community members as well think will be the best use of this so got my support

[Speaker 1] (2:09:32 - 2:10:15)
well there will be questions for the applicant of the Alderwoman can I get a motion to move to pass on the same roll call that was used to determine form we'll move Mr. Chairman Mr. Chair Ravois makes that motion any objections to the motion hearing none the item is passed all right top of page 12 document number 20734 in the first ward ordinance was referred on May 26th of 21 common address is 2934 through 40 West Medill Avenue and the change request from the C12 neighborhood commercial district to B23 neighborhood mixed use district we have Mark Kupiak on the call

[Speaker 13] (2:10:16 - 2:10:53)
thank you Chairman my name is Mark Kupiak I represent the applicant in this case zoning change we're looking to rezone property commonly known as 2934-40 West Medill Avenue and we're asking to rezone from the C12 district to a B2-3 district before we begin Mr. Chairman one procedural matter I would like to amend our application and amend it to a type 1 application we did deliver plans and narrative to the zoning department and I'd like to amend the application and proceed as a type 1

[Speaker 1] (2:10:54 - 2:11:10)
okay so Vice Chair Mr. Rebollos moves to amend the application to a type 1 application by the same roll call that was used to determine form. So moved.

Any objections? Hearing none the item is now amended to a type 1 application. Proceed.

[Speaker 13] (2:11:11 - 2:13:31)
Thank you and again 2934 West Medill very close to the intersection of Milwaukee Avenue and Fullerton subject property just located just to the south and west of Liberty Bank on that corner subject property has dimensions of 175 feet on Medill and 132 feet deep the property was vacant when the applicant bought it but it appears and we're told that the last building was a commercial use could have been a contractor's building and a contractor's yard obviously that would be demolished and he's looking if the zoning change is granted looking to build a new residential building with building amenities and parking on the ground floor and 56 dwelling units on the upper floors we've been working on this for a long time had an extensive community process working with Alderman LaSpada and the First Ward we've had numerous rounds of community feedback we also had more specific engagement the applicant did with Project Logan which is a local art group that has worked at this site for a period of time before the applicant bought the property one nice feature about this particular building that drew some favorable comments is that area of Milwaukee Avenue in recent years they've had some multi-unit buildings built but some of those buildings had a predominant of one bedroom apartments the nice feature about this project is it's predominantly two bedroom apartments which draws some favorable comment from people in the neighborhood I mentioned another point is that we've been working a long time started this project under the old ARO affordable requirements ordinance we were not able to get it done before the new ordinance passed but we're proceeding with the project and we will comply with the new ARO affordable requirements ordinance so with that community process with our extensive engagement with the alderman and his staff the alderman did voice his support for the project and I believe he did send you his letter of support and with that we would ask for your favorable recommendation

[Speaker 1] (2:13:32 - 2:14:23)
letter of support from Alderman Lozada questions, comments from committee members can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine form so moved Alderman Had makes the motion any objections hearing none this item is passed as amended to a type one thank you next middle of page 12 document number 20954-T1 in the eighth ward the ordinance was referred on February 23, 2022 common address is 9901 South Cottage Grove Avenue and the change request from an M-1-1 Limited Manufacturing Business Park District to a C-3-1 Commercial Manufacturing and Employment District Rolando Acosta

[Speaker 23] (2:14:23 - 2:15:18)
good afternoon Mr. Chairman I was going to use the better looking partner joke but you already used it for Sarah and Nick so I am here for Rolando though we're representing JFA Real Estate and it's a technical rezoning to correct a split zoning lot condition the parcel being rezoned is a driveway that provides access to applicants property to the south and the property to the south is zoned C-3-1 and we seek to unify this all under a C-3-1 zoning for consistent zoning as a preliminary matter this is in the Burnside Industrial Corridor which required us to go to plan commission and we received approval last week from plan commission and I would ask that that record of proceeding be incorporated here today

[Speaker 1] (2:15:20 - 2:15:29)
Michael staff asked me after it passed plan commission there were no changes whatsoever correct

[Speaker 23] (2:15:29 - 2:15:40)
we also have a substitute narrative and plans which are on file with DPD and those were filed prior to plan commission so there's no changes since plan commission

[Speaker 41] (2:15:40 - 2:15:43)
from the original filing we do have a substitute narrative and plans

[Speaker 1] (2:15:45 - 2:16:05)
so when we incorporate the records that will be taken care of correct so Alderman Cardona moves to incorporate the records by the same role any objections those records are now incorporated continue

[Speaker 23] (2:16:05 - 2:16:22)
and so with that and again I think that includes the substitute narrative and plans which are on file with DPD as well and we have a letter of support on file with your office from Alderman Harris and available to answer

Of course. Kate if you could I believe Kate is in attendance. I'm not sure if she is in there.

She has been promoted as a panelist. Kate if you could say a few words about the project.

[Speaker 26] (2:21:02 - 2:22:16)
I can. Thank you and thank you Mr. Chairman and thank you to everybody. Hopefully you can hear me.

It is okay. Wonderful. Thank you.

As many of you know during the last two years we have been called upon to serve our communities in ways that we never thought we would need to. We have seen an exponential growth in the number of people turning to us and during that time we have also seen acute need for the most nutritious prepared meals which has deepened our resolve to expand into this space to make sure that everybody who is vulnerable and who faces hunger in our great city has the food that they need not just to get by but to thrive. This project will be game changing for the Greater Chicago Food Depository and it will make it possible for us to reach people who today we cannot reach with nutritious meals made from scratch using great ingredients to ensure that everyone in our city can live healthy lives.

Thank you so much for your consideration and the chance to say a few words.

[Speaker 1] (2:22:16 - 2:23:24)
Thank you, Kate. Questions, comments from committee members? Let me be the first to congratulate the Chicago Food Depository and I've known Ed Burr for probably 40 years I have never heard him so eloquently as far as I've never heard him be so auditory about a project.

That being said this is good for Chicago good for the 14th Ward and I hope it gets started sooner than later on your expansion and your continued service to the community. Can I get a motion to move, do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine form? Vice Chair makes the motion.

Any objections to the motion? Hearing none, the item is passed as revised. All right continue the good work.

Thank you.

[Speaker 14] (2:23:24 - 2:23:25)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:23:27 - 2:24:01)
Page 13 document number 20784 in the 27th Ward ordinance was referred on July 21st of 21 the common address is 1215-1265 West Division Street also 1030-1178 North Elston and finally 1200-1212 West Cortez the change request manufacturing development number 2 to business plan development we have Paul Shadle on the call in the 27th Ward

[Speaker 25] (2:24:01 - 2:24:54)
Good afternoon Chairman Taney and members of the committee for the record Paul Shadle with the law firm of DLA Piper representing the applicant LPC Division 1 LP which is the applicant for plan development approval for the proposed warehouse and distribution center project proposed to be developed on this site which is approximately 11 acres located at the southwest corner of Elston and Division Streets with me this morning are Will Freave and Ben Fish from the applicant if there are questions the application was considered during a public hearing by the Chicago Planning Commission on April 21st and the commission recommended approval I request that the record of that proceeding be incorporated into the record of this meeting including substitute materials that were included to accommodate Alderman Burnett's request that this site accommodate periodic non-accessory parking

[Speaker 1] (2:24:58 - 2:25:09)
Alderman Cardona moves to incorporate the records from the Planning Commission by the same roll call that was used to determine form any objections? Hearing none the records are incorporated continue Paul

[Speaker 25] (2:25:10 - 2:25:34)
I would just note that this project is the first of its kind a two-story plus mezzanines warehouse building with multi-story accessory office space and a separate employee parking structure as I noted we have available representatives from the applicant to answer any questions that members of the committee may have and with that I would respectfully ask for this committee's positive recommendation to the full council

[Speaker 1] (2:25:38 - 2:25:39)
Alderman Burnett

[Speaker 4] (2:25:40 - 2:27:09)
Yes thank you Mr. Chairman and members of the committee so as the councillor said we did have them meet with the local community organization which is North French Work they're fully in support of it and other members of the committee don't have a problem with it but this used to be the former people gas site this is where their offices was I'm sure they had to spend a lot of money on environmental stuff to clean it up we've asked the developer to encourage the contractor to joint venture with an African American contractor hire people from the community one of the reasons that we were interested in allowing for off-site accessible parking to be on that site is because it's kitty corner from the Morton Salts concert venue that's across the street and it would give them an opportunity to have more parking when they have different venues going on in the area so I thought that would be a win-win for both sides they can make a little door off of those patrons but also Morton can help clear our streets and traffic up with some accessory parking in the area I support this my community support it I ask for this committee's support

[Speaker 1] (2:27:09 - 2:27:35)
thank you any questions for the applicant or the alderman hearing none can I get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used in the term of the quorum Vice Chair Roboius makes the motion any objections to his motion hearing none this item is passed as revised thank you sir

[Speaker 4] (2:27:35 - 2:27:40)
and allow me to take my son's picture down in the background

[Speaker 1] (2:27:44 - 2:28:37)
I get in trouble by commenting on things let's see we are now in the 26th ward document number 20912 the ordinance was referred on January 26th of 2022 common address is 1800-1840 North Hamlet 1821-1857 North Hamlet 3735-3759 West Cortland 1820-1856 North Ridgeway and the change request from an M11 limited manufacturing business park district and M12 limited manufacturing business park district all to an RM6 residential multi-unit district and then to a planned development we have Steve Friedland on the call on the 26th ward I think we have slides

[Speaker 7] (2:28:37 - 2:31:44)
yes thank you Mr. Chairman Steve Friedland with the law firm of Applegate and Thorne Thompson here on behalf of the applicant Encontro Square No.

1 Limited Partnership the applicant is a joint venture between two very well known Chicago developers Evergreen Development and Lucha who have come together to present this project also with me on the call representing Evergreen is Kate Gronstal representing Lucha is Charlene Andrees and I believe from our architecture team Canopy Architects we have Andrea McCool the project is located at the western terminus of the 606 and this is a project that's been taking a while to come to fruition if you go to the next slide you can see the project timeline here it began several years ago this has really been spearheaded by the City of Chicago and Alderman Maldonado the Alderman has been steadfast in desire to see affordable housing in this location which is the location of the old Maggot Glove Factory and we're here today to present the final iteration of all of those meetings that you see on the screen you can go to the next slide the first phase of this project will be in two buildings that you see in sub area A there will be a total of 89 units all of these units will be affordable under the Loan Commission Tax Credit Program there is a second phase that we intend to move forward with in the future that will be in sub area B and it would provide up to 98 units of affordable housing it's also worth noting on this slide that you can see that right at the terminus of the 606 to the south of our property will be a new public park all of this land is currently owned by the City of Chicago so this is a project that will really transform this area you can go to the next slide this just gives you a view of those two buildings and you can see sort of in shadow behind it what would be or what we intend to be our third building for the second phase the project as I say has been supported by Alderman Maldonado and the City for quite some time so I know that the applicant really wants to thank them for all of their assistance I guess I would ask at this time we did go to the Planning Commission last Thursday on the 21st so we would like to incorporate the record of the Planning Commission into this hearing

[Speaker 1] (2:31:47 - 2:32:28)
Vice Chair Mr. Raboyas moves to incorporate the records from the Planning Commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum any objections?

So moved Mr. Chairman objections the records are incorporated Steve continue thank you so again these are our two buildings we'd certainly be prepared to take any questions you might have but thank you for allowing us to present we'll have a couple questions obviously I saw the presentation at the Planning Commission would the second half be 100% affordable also?

[Speaker 7] (2:32:29 - 2:33:47)
Yes the second project would also be an affordable development and as I think we mentioned Mr. Chair and I'll say it again for the record we would do that pursuant to a site plan review with the DPD staff but we have agreed we would go back to Planning Commission for a courtesy presentation at a live meeting for the design and location of that building just based on this slide where is 606? So the 606 if you can see sort of a circular area at the end of Ridgeway so Ridgeway is the street which is to the east of building 2 and if you take Ridgeway all the way to the south end that is the end of the 606 and the new proposed part hopefully will happen is that green area that's next to the number 3? Correct to the south of what is shown sort of as a number 3 that building 3 that area there will be a public park.

[Speaker 1] (2:33:52 - 2:34:30)
I know that Alderman Maldonado spoke very much in favor and expressed how long he had been working on this project so we know we have his support any questions, comments from committee members? None. Can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

And that is Alderman is that Alderman Wagespack? Yes sir and I know Scott while I have you, you commented extensively on this project. Do you want to say anything to the committee members?

[Speaker 10] (2:34:32 - 2:35:41)
Yeah sure I think during the plan commission we had a great presentation from Steve and I think a lot of the people that were working on it when we look at where those metro lines come in we were talking a little bit about how they are going to continue to develop that area and make it more safe for I think what will be a lot of children and families in that area especially the ones that would be in the affordable housing and I think as Alderman Maldonado said really putting this building there, this set of buildings around with the surrounding community and hopefully preventing a little bit of the gentrification that's been kind of hitting that area this is a project that's I think everyone will be very happy to see but also want to move into at the end of the 606 so I think Commissioner from CDOT also talked about working on some of these safety measures around those rail lines as well so it's just a fantastic project and I fully support it as well

[Speaker 1] (2:35:42 - 2:36:30)
Alright so Alderman Wagesbeck makes the motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum any objections?

[Speaker 1] (2:40:24 - 2:41:09)
Questions, comments from the committee I just have one comment, especially while we're on this screen, it's nice to see the uses together but yet separately So you have the office complex, then you have the hotel and then the residential To me, obviously instead of stacking them literally giving them each their own identity I think that's pretty cool Alderman Burnett says on this thing, this Mews are just connectors, basically open air connectors from in this case Katie, tell us I thought there were two sets of Mews Is there just the one?

[Speaker 18] (2:41:12 - 2:41:37)
The one shown on the screen is green Green on the right-hand side Peoria on the left-hand side There's an existing office building that's not shown on the screen to the east that already has an existing three block connection from Halstead to Greene So with the two buildings, you can get from Halstead to Peoria PD 1359 That building is already built with that mid-block connection

[Speaker 1] (2:41:41 - 2:42:47)

[Speaker 6] (2:42:49 - 2:43:36)
Good afternoon Mr. Chairman and members of the committee My name is Jack George I'm an attorney with the Law Firm of Akron LLC and I represent William Wrigley and Company The subject property as you've indicated Mr. Chairman is at 1132 West Blackfawk It's in the 27th ward Before you today is an amendment to PD 847 We are seeking to expand the boundaries of the PD to provide additional parking for the new pilot plant that my client wishes to build on the property Mr. Chairman, this was before the plan commission on April 21st this year and I would respectfully request at this time that the record of proceedings before the plan commission the exhibits and testimony be incorporated and be made a part of the proceedings before you today

[Speaker 1] (2:43:38 - 2:43:44)
Vice-Chair, Roboius needs to incorporate the records from the plan commission on the same roll call that was used in the determining form Any objections?

[Speaker 6] (2:43:46 - 2:47:15)
Hearing none, the records are incorporated Would you continue please? Yes, this property is up on the screen right now. You said this property is located at the end of Goose Island You can see our property is designated there as MARS Wrigley The site is presently improved by the Wrigley Company with an innovation center research center Can you go to the next slide please?

This slide is the site plan The existing innovation center is at the very north end The area that's colored out is where the new pilot plant is going to go Right now that space is being used for parking So we're going to lose that parking so we have to then make up for it in the property to the right which is just the east of Cherry Street That property is now going to be incorporated into the plan development so that the additional parking can be provided for over there The next slide please This shows this is an aerial view of the subject site and the left portion you can see the existing innovation global center and right to the right of that is the existing pilot plant and then there's the proposed new pilot plant that's right to the right of that which would be 40,000 square feet That's what we're seeking to do but where that proposed pilot plant is going as I've indicated that used to be parking and so the parking now is being taken it's going to be just in the background there you see that large parking lot that will be the parking lot that will be made up for it. The next slide please And this is just a rendering and showing of the site Here it shows again from the left portion you'll see the innovation center and on the right hand of the existing pilot plant and then the new pilot plant I think that takes care of all the slides This is just the last slide which just shows the view looking north on Cherry Street The thing about this is that as we were doing this plan development you'll see there are railroad tracks that are in the street there just to the right Those are going to be taken up we're paying for the cost of having those removed and then that will be used as a bike path going all the way up eventually it will all go up to North Avenue which is the north end of the property that stands right at the end and there's a water basin there and then there's a bridge and then there's North Avenue This bike path will now be allowed people to use it and go all the way from North Avenue all the way down to Division Street That's really the sum and substance of this project The total cost of the project is $40 million When the new proposed pilot plant is up there will be about 550 people working in all three buildings here on this site William Wrigley is extremely proud of this proposed plant It's going to help them to expand They're testing new products for the Wrigley company and it will be a tremendous thing for our city and it's a great step and it shows the commitment of Morris Wrigley and the Wrigley company to expanding here in the city of Chicago Based on that Mr. Chairman and members of the committee I would ask for your favorable recommendation for this project We stand ready to answer any questions that you might have Mr. Chairman

[Speaker 1] (2:47:17 - 2:47:18)
Thank you Mr. George

[Speaker 35] (2:47:21 - 2:47:22)
Alderman Burnett

[Speaker 6] (2:47:30 - 2:47:35)
Alderman Burnett did testify at the plant commission hearing but I know he wanted to speak to you

[Speaker 1] (2:47:35 - 2:48:21)
Well in his absence I was at the plant commission and Alderman Burnett spoke very highly of this expansion of research and innovation center and Morris commitment to the city So I know that he is in total support of this project and also I'll give you your last chance to accommodate us No? Alright Well you'll have to take it from me the chairman that Alderman Burnett is extremely excited about this project Alright, questions for Mr. George or the team?

Can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine form

[Speaker 4] (2:48:21 - 2:49:05)
I'm sorry Mr. Chairman I just want to say Alderman Burnett I'll pause there I just want to say it's a beautiful project North Branch works 100% all the businesses in the area they do a great job with their program it's good to have this big corporation to stay in Chicago and to expand this property and I wish they would allow me to be a tester for their new projects coming online new gum new candy, all that stuff, but they, I can't do that. My dentist won't let me.

But anyway, I support this 100%. I ask for the committee support also. Thank you.

Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (2:49:06 - 2:49:08)
Alderman Weissbach, did you have your hand up for a second?

[Speaker 10] (2:49:09 - 2:49:24)
No, I did, Chairman. I was just going to say that I was at the Planning Commission as well, in case Alderman Burnett wasn't able to speak. I agree with you that it was an excellent project and would make a motion if you're ready.

All right.

[Speaker 1] (2:49:25 - 2:49:33)
Hold on a second. I see you, Roberto. I see you.

Okay. Would you like to be recognized, Alderman Maldonado?

[Speaker 27] (2:49:34 - 2:50:36)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just got noticed that this meeting was going on today, that this item was going to be on the agenda. So I'm glad I was able to jump in and express my full support for the Encuentro project.

This is going to have a great impact in our ward that is gentrifying and to bring 185 new affordable housing units into that site with the first phase of 89 units is going to be great for our working families at the end of the 606 trail. So I want to thank Lucia for their hard work and Commissioner Navarro and Commissioner Cox for their continuous support in helping us to build affordable housing that we so badly need in the 26th ward. Thank you so very much.

[Speaker 1] (2:50:37 - 2:51:35)
Thank you, Alderman Maldonado and both Alderman Waguespack and myself spoke and not as eloquently as you in regards to your support for the project, but congratulations and we look forward to not only the affordable housing and the public park that hopefully will be adjacent to that too. So congratulations on that item of Encuentro. But now we're back to Alderman Burnett on the Mars expansion.

Alderman Waguespack makes a motion on a move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum on the Wrigley site. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, this item is passed as revised and now I need, according to my staff, I need, so can I get a motion to adjourn the zoning meeting?

[Speaker 41] (2:51:37 - 2:51:40)
Alderman Waguespack makes a motion to adjourn.

[Speaker 1] (2:51:41 - 2:51:53)
You want to continue, Scott? Scott, Alderman Waguespack makes a motion to adjourn. Any objections?

Hearing none, the item, this meeting is adjourned. See you all tomorrow.
