[Speaker 1] (20:39 - 20:58)
Welcome back. The December 13, 2022 Committee on Zoning Landmarks and Building Standards is called to order. We'll start off with the roll call.

Committee members, please note that your yes or present response will be deemed a yes vote when this quorum call is used as a reference vote for later items. All right.

[Speaker 13] (20:59 - 21:47)
Vice Chair Arroyo, Alderman Hopkins, Alderman Dowell, Alderman Sawyer, Alderman Beal, Alderman Raymond Lopez, Alderman David Moore, Mike Rodriguez, Alderman Sitio Lopez, Alderman Burnett, Alderman Cardona, Alderman Wagesveld, Alderwoman Austin, Alderman Villegas, Alderman Riley, Alderman Kappelman, Alderman Osterman, Alderwoman Haddon.

[Speaker 1] (21:48 - 21:49)
Did you have a quorum?

[Speaker 13] (21:50 - 21:50)
Thirteen.

[Speaker 1] (21:52 - 23:25)
We'll now move on to the approval of the Rule 45 reports containing the minutes of the November hearing of the Committee on Zoning Landmark and Building Standards. All members of this committee should have received an electronic copy. And if hearing no objections, do I have a motion by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum to approve the minutes?

Alderman Raymond Lopez makes the motion. Any objections? Hearing none, the report has been approved.

Moving on, we will now hear the items to be deferred. I will read the file number, the address, and page number and take a motion for all at the end. For the record, these items do not appear on the revised agenda in front of you, that being on page five.

Let's start with page five of the regular agenda, file number 22023, the address commonly known as 328 West 40th Place. On page nine of the deferred agenda, file number 21191, the address commonly known as 911 North Mozart Street. Okay.

No questions by committee members. Alderman Uroboros makes a motion to defer the previously listed items by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, these items will be deferred. We have three public speakers sign up for today's hearing. We'll hear from them now.

We will start with Kimmie Jordan, followed by George Blakemore, followed by James Majerowicz. I think I got that right. Okay.

All right. Up to the... Good morning.

[Speaker 29] (23:26 - 23:27)
Good morning.

[Speaker 1] (23:27 - 23:29)
You identify yourself for the record and proceed.

[Speaker 29] (23:29 - 25:20)
Good morning. My name is Kimmie Jordan. I hope that you will vote in favor of the Chicago Casino.

I was born and raised on the south side of Chicago, and now I live in the back of the yards in the 16th Ward. I am a proud member of Unite Here Local One, Chicago's Hospitality Workers Union. Our members live in all 50 wards.

Most of us are women, and most of us are people of color. The Unite Here Chicago Hospitality Institute recruits and trains apprentices from traditionally underserved populations for its Department of Labor Registry Apprenticeship Program, the first of its kind in the state of Illinois. The Unite Here Chicago Hospitality Institute recent culinary apprentice are 40% African Americans, 46% African Americans, 40% Hispanic or Latinos, and 8% Asian Pacific Island.

I, like many other hospitality workers, was laid off when the pandemic hit two years ago. I am now back at work at a downtown hotel, but a lot of my co-workers still haven't been called back to their good jobs and are starting their lives all over again. The Chicago Casino will give hospitality workers like me get a chance at a new beginning, a chance not only to go back to the industries that they love, but also knowledge that they will be able to take care of their families.

Having a good union job changed my life for the better. More union, good job, more good, I'm sorry, more union, good paying hospitality jobs for workers like me will put money into the neighborhood and uplift my community. Again, I hope that you will vote in favor, I hope you will vote yes for the Chicago Casino.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (25:21 - 25:40)
Thank you, Ms. Jordan. And for the record, why don't you have your team of supporters stand up so the council recognizes the efforts that are put forth with the casino. All right, thank you.

Our next speaker, George Blakemore.

[Speaker 13] (25:43 - 25:44)
Good morning.

[Speaker 17] (25:44 - 28:26)
I was on time at 10 o'clock. The reason that you didn't start on time because you didn't have a call. You all are getting paid.

You're getting paid. If it would be a city employee, you will be docked for being 15 minutes late. Don't let that happen anymore because it's a bad example.

That's why you're waiting. Anyway, I am against, I'm for the casino. Surely I am.

But it would have been wise for you all to own the casino and just get someone to manage the casino for you. Did you ever think about that? Also, I advocate that 20% of those jobs, good contracts and service, will be for Black people, a set aside.

Professional jobs, bricklayers, electricians, whatever. But why would Black people be entitled to 20% of the job? Because we're the only people that was enslaved in America.

And you can have affirmative action. You can have the white woman. You can have a disadvantaged white man.

You can have a Hispanic. You can have an Asian. And you don't have to have anyone Black because you will fulfill the affirmative action because you have the minority.

So I'm advocating for 20% of these jobs, good contracts and service, will be set aside for Black people. And I'm anti-New Americans that do not follow the United States law, go along with their immigration laws, immigration and naturalization. So that's why it's very important to help someone, a Mr. Blakemore character, speak. You get an F, all of you. So you play the game, say, we're going to be a few minutes late. Y'all getting paid.

And you're getting paid to serve the public. You also got more than one item and only give us three minutes. If I want to talk about another item, you should be glad and sit and wait and listen.

You are a public servant and you serve the public, not yourself. May God bless each one of you. And in return, bless somebody else.

And you know, I'm kind of prejudiced. Bless somebody else that's Black.

[Speaker 13] (28:26 - 28:48)
Here is James Majerovitz from the famous 44th ward. So good morning, sir. Cargo resident.

[Speaker 26] (28:50 - 29:29)
Worked very diligently with Commissioner Beaudet, Matt Alwick and Marlene Hopkins for this CODOR ordinance that we put together. I mean, it was very diligent and took you corrections. I stand here in support of the code amendments, the cleanup, and I would like to thank Commissioner Beaudet, Matt Alwick, I mean, Grant Alwick and Deputy Commissioner Marlene Hopkins for all the hard work we've done putting this together.

So stand in support of this. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (29:29 - 31:03)
Thank you very much. Thanks for coming down today and for all the plumbers unions that keep our city safe and strong. So appreciate you.

All right. That concludes the public speaking portion of the hearing. We'll start off with the addendum to the agenda.

First up is document number 02022-3777. The mayoral application to amend municipal code titles 2, 4, 11, 14a, 14b, 17 and 18 and technical corrections to journal of proceedings of April 21st of 2021. That being ordinance 02021-1193 and September 21st, 2022.

That ordinance being SO2022-2008 regarding Chicago construction codes. We also have a substitute. All members should have received a copy of the substitute as well as a summary electronically on Friday, December 9th.

You'll also find a copy in your folder. Please also note that there are letters of opposition to this matter in your folder. Before I'd like to get it on, I'd like to accept a motion to, like a motion to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Cardona makes the motion to accept the substitute. Any objections? Hearing none, the substitute is before us.

All right. Commissioner Matt Bode of the building department is present on this matter. Matt.

[Speaker 2] (31:05 - 34:13)
Thank you. Good morning, chairman, Tony, and members of the committee on zoning landmarks and building standards. My name is Matt Bode.

I'm the building commissioner. With me today is managing deputy Grant Ulrich. I'm here today to ask for your favorable consideration for the technical corrections and modification amendments to various chapters of the Chicago construction codes.

I believe you received a copy of the substitute and a summary of the sections. As you recall, the city of Chicago approved the first major rewrite of the Chicago building code in 70 years, and that modernized code went into effect on August 1st, 2020. As promised, when that was passed, DOB continues to work with all the stakeholders and have come before this council when we have identified a need to clarify and enhance the codes.

The amendments package before you for your consideration reflects those ongoing efforts. I'm grateful to our partners and the skilled trades. And for these amendments, in particular, the plumbers, local 130.

So thank you to President Majerwicz. And please pass our thanks on to business manager, Jim coin, the electricians, stationary engineers, as well as our fellow city departments and housing, planning and development, water management, the mayor's office for people with disabilities for their input in making the code better and more user-friendly to provide a few highlights. The proposed amendments provides for automatic fee waivers for simple repair and replacement permits, EPP, so windows and doors for landmark buildings, which streamlines and reduces the time to permit for that minor work, excludes exterior stairs from the 700 square foot area limit on coach houses, thus increasing opportunities for homeowners and also for maintaining and expanding these affordable housing units, clarifies the contractors may face disciplinary action for performing work in violation of a city closure order.

This is similar to penalties they face for violating a stop work order and also revises the penalty for stop work orders consistent with other largest jurisdictions and to apply an equitable application of those fines. And the last point, the current penalty is disproportionately greater for smaller projects than larger or these are mega developments, basically allowing mega developments to treat it as a cost of doing business. For instance, currently a $500 permit pays a 100% stop work penalty, while a $200,000 permit for a mega development pays a mere 15% penalty.

Under the proposed amendments, the mega developments would pay a 200% penalty. Again, this is similar to what other large jurisdictions do. Our predecessors when they did the code with the lower scale probably thought that some of these mega developers would never even consider doing work without permits and we found that not to be the case.

So the amendment would provide for an equitable scale and not allow mega developers to treat stop work order penalties as basically a cost of doing business. Thank you for your time and I ask your favorable consideration and I'm happy to answer any questions you may have.

[Speaker 1] (34:13 - 34:18)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. All right, questions. All the woman had.

[Speaker 24] (34:19 - 34:57)
Thank you, Chair. And thank you, Commissioner. I just a quick question I was reading through some of our materials and these code amendments I think we had some letters of concern about some of the plumbing code amendments.

I'm wondering if you could just speak to the air pockets being allowed. There were a couple just specifically talking about air pockets being allowed and some concerns about Legionella. Although I think one of the letters that we submitted also did state that there was no proof that airborne pathogens could be formed in there.

I just wanted you to clarify that for those of us who do not understand plumbing.

[Speaker 2] (34:58 - 35:17)
Yeah, so thank you for that question. And again, we've got Grant Ulrich and the plumbing guru here, Jim Majerowicz, who actually writes codes across the country. And you're correct, it's a great question, but there is no scientific proof that this causes pathogens and as we develop the new code we want to follow the science.

[Speaker 24] (35:18 - 35:29)
And the code changes are helping with the problem of water hammering, which I think my building's going through right now. This is the really loud banging in the pipes that we hear?

[Speaker 13] (35:29 - 35:30)
Yeah, that's correct.

[Speaker 24] (35:32 - 35:33)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (35:33 - 35:40)
Thank you. Mr. Majerowicz, you want to add some comment to that since you write this stuff?

[Speaker 26] (35:41 - 37:00)
Right, so what we did with it, you know, it was a maximum of 24 inches before so that, and we dropped that down to 12. And 12 inches air chambers have been the standard in the city of Chicago or the state of Illinois for well over 100 years. And as the commissioner said, there's no proof of any airborne contaminants that are in the air chambers.

And the hammer arresters, if needed, are in the code and you could still put them in if there's the case, but the air chambers are the most cost-effective way of doing plumbing to save the end users money. If they need a hammer arrester for any special type of device, it is allowed in the code. And then many of the air hammer arresters that are out there require access panels driving the cost of these jobs up.

This is, we're trying to streamline this to make it as cost-effective. And as the commissioner said, we have no technical data saying that Legionella has ever come from a air chamber.

[Speaker 1] (37:01 - 37:11)
Thank you, sir. I know Alderman Villegas. No, Mr. Chairman, that was my exact same question. So, all right. Alderman Kappelman.

[Speaker 35] (37:12 - 37:41)
Thank you. Good morning, commissioner. So when we look at the cost of housing, it's skyrocketing everywhere and best practices stayed over and over again.

There's a number of ways to cut down. And one of those ways to cut down is to streamline the whole process to build. And so I applaud this.

I'm very, very excited about it. Do we have any sense of how much this could save on the cost of building something?

[Speaker 2] (37:42 - 38:54)
It's a great question. Thank you for that. And I think what we try to do, and President Majerwicz said it as well, we work very close with the industries and the trades and the contractors and the developers to find any place where we could maintain safety, but get the cost down.

So it's not so much, this would save you X amount of dollars, even if it's a small amount. What we're trying to do is make sure that the code has all these little provisions in there that when you look at it in totality, you're really driving the cost down. She said, we have an affordability issue in the city as well as the country, and we need to find any small areas where we could improve the codes, make them more user-friendly, make them more cost-effective while maintaining public safety.

That's what we're trying to do with this code amendment package, and we're not done. So we're constantly always scanning the codes, working with our partners, working with your offices to identify any little areas where we could drive the cost down. And collectively, it's going to make a huge difference.

[Speaker 35] (38:55 - 39:16)
Thank you. I learned from your predecessor, it's very complicated and very difficult work, but it's all worth it. So I applaud those efforts and I'm glad that we're aligning ourselves more with the international building code.

It just, it makes it so much easier to get things done. So thank you so much. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 2] (39:16 - 39:50)
As well, we say the aligning with the model codes, it allows, those are updated every two or three years so that they're drawing all the best practices from around the country and new technology. And that's the route we want to take as opposed to waiting decades or 70 years to modernize our codes. We want to have it a living, breathing document that goes with technology, goes with best practices, goes with great ideas that are brought to us by the industry and your offices.

And we can make these quick changes as we're doing now.

[Speaker 1] (39:50 - 39:51)
Great.

[Speaker 7] (39:51 - 39:51)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (39:52 - 39:54)
Thank you, Alderman Raymond Lopez.

[Speaker 7] (39:56 - 40:32)
Thank you, Chairman. And good morning, members of the committee. Good morning, Commissioner.

A few questions. First off, thank you for the handy breakdown. I have a couple of questions on page four of the substitute.

Well, actually, before we get to that, there's a number of items in the first two pages that I guess reference the difference between knowingly and recklessly of the state, a change that I guess the code is seeking to correct. Can you explain a little bit where that's coming from and what we're doing with them?

[Speaker 2] (40:32 - 41:05)
Sure. For knowingly or recklessly, what we're doing is basically modeling the state codes. So we're trying to, again, use the same language that's used everywhere else.

So not have a Chicago-specific language of what knowingly or recklessly is. As you know, as an attorney, there are a number of definitions out there that are used to define these terms, and that's what we're doing. We're basically making our code model what everybody else uses for the definition of knowingly and recklessly, and this comes out of the Illinois Code.

[Speaker 7] (41:06 - 41:30)
And is this simply with regards to construction, or is this going to be something that we're going to incorporate? And if you don't know, if the law department knows or somebody else, are these two terms that we're going to start incorporating throughout the rest of the municipal code with regards to other aspects of daily life? That I wouldn't know.

That would be a question for the law department. Is the state law only specific to building code?

[Speaker 2] (41:32 - 41:47)
No, I think we're using, because I think it comes out of the criminal code, if I'm not mistaken. When you're prosecuting and there's language that's knowingly and recklessly, and we want to model that.

[Speaker 7] (41:47 - 42:16)
It's a lot easier for us. The reason I ask is because obviously, as you are well aware, we have an ordinance, the Troubled Building Ordinance, and I think that those two terms specifically can be very beneficial, and I know they're not included in this ordinance, but if a property owner or landlord or housing provider knowingly or recklessly allows certain activities, I'm wondering if we can incorporate that next.

[Speaker 2] (42:17 - 42:34)
Sure. That's exactly why we're here, and that's why I'm always open to these suggestions, and this is a perfect one. I wrote a note, and I know Grant's writing a note right now.

We stole him from the law department, so hopefully he'll call his colleagues and say, this is a great idea. So thank you all.

[Speaker 7] (42:34 - 43:03)
Back to page four. Thank you, Commissioner. Back to page four.

14A3-3-307.5, legal action. It says, any city official who becomes aware of a violation of a closure order is directed to immediately request the corporation council seek remedies provided by law. There are 50 of us in this room that are considered city officials.

Does that apply to us as well? Oh, yes. So if you could elaborate.

[Speaker 2] (43:04 - 44:04)
Sorry, just to clarify, we've had very good language for stop work orders, and this is actually basically parroted from the stop work order sections. What I've learned from doing a lot more closure orders is that the language associated with closure orders is lacking, to say the least. So what we want to do is make sure that we have no other lawyers in the room, myself included, yourself included, and zoning lawyers, and we don't want to be in a situation where we're in administrative hearings or circuit court, and some lawyer says, oh, what's your authority for doing this?

So now we have it. So this is a great cleanup. As you go through the code, we notice that we have a very robust section for stop work orders, but we don't have that for closure orders, and we want to make sure that we have all the tools we have necessary.

[Speaker 7] (44:04 - 45:05)
Okay. Thank you. I think that's very important for us to make sure that we have, because as you and your team know very well, I am constantly calling you for people violating stop work orders, so I know that now, so if I don't have to necessarily harass you, I can go straight to our friends in the law department for them to take action all the better.

Please let us know, too, because then we can go after the contractors that are out there. Don't worry, you'll be included. I wouldn't want you to run out of things to do, Commissioner.

I have a car. With regards to page 11, the fire alarm and detection systems, is this just for new construction? Because I know that we did an ordinance, I think, championed by our colleague Alderman Villegas a year or two ago with regards to fire systems and things of that nature.

Is this just new construction, or is this an upgrade to all buildings?

[Speaker 2] (45:07 - 45:12)
It's great to answer that, to use more detail on it.

[Speaker 10] (45:12 - 45:38)
So this change in section two on page 11, Alderman, is really just correcting a heading to match the body of the section. So our colleagues in MOPD pointed out this is an accessibility requirement that certain fire alarm devices also have a visual component, and the body of the text, which was amended by Chicago to match the Illinois Accessibility Code, and the heading that we adopted previously did not match. So this is really just amending the heading.

[Speaker 13] (45:39 - 45:44)
It's not making a substantive change in the code. Okay.

[Speaker 7] (45:46 - 46:12)
And then lastly, on page 23, under the section debt waivers, am I reading this correctly in seeing that the Commissioner of Housing is now being given authority to waive city-owned debt without approval of the City Council?

[Speaker 2] (46:12 - 46:26)
That is an existing section. So when that section was introduced and passed by Council, let me see if I can find the right section here that we have on where we have it stricken.

[Speaker 7] (46:26 - 46:28)
Because it looks like new section.

[Speaker 2] (46:29 - 47:18)
It's basically, it's moving it from the building code. So when it was originally introduced, it was part of the building code, sorry, on page four of the amendment. Thank you, Grant, for pointing that out.

So on page four of the amendment, at the very bottom, 14A3-313-6, that was originally passed by the Council, granting the Housing Commissioner the authority to waive those debts, but it was placed in the building code. And just as a matter of cleanup, I'd rather not have other Commissioners' sections in the building code and vice versa. I don't want mine in the housing code.

So we're moving it from the building code to the housing code.

[Speaker 7] (47:18 - 47:19)
All right. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (47:19 - 47:39)
All right. Thank you, Chairman. Thank you, Alderman Lopez.

Any other questions? If not, can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderman Haddon makes the motion.

Any objections? Hearing none, the ordinance is passed as amended.

[Speaker 13] (47:40 - 47:42)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee.

[Speaker 1] (47:43 - 48:12)
All right. Okay. All right.

So the next item I'm going to read, I'm going to ask for a deferral. That is document number 02022-3785, a mayoral application amending Municipal Code Chapter 17-2, 17-3, 17-9, and 17-10 regarding a textual correction update of the Chicago Zoning Ordinance. Before I ask to defer, Patrick, just give us the cliff notes on why we're doing this.

[Speaker 34] (48:12 - 49:00)
Sure. Yes, Chairman. Patrick Murphy, Department of Planning and Development.

The original ordinance was just to clean up a few text errors, formatting errors in the Connected Communities Ordinance from this past summer. We were working with the law department and the Department of Housing. We found a few other just slight misprints, nothing that changed the substance of the ordinance.

We had put that together in a substitute. And then in further discussion with yourself, some of your colleagues and the Department of Housing, we were going to make some other slight text changes to other sections in the same ordinance. Because those new sections were not noticed, we have to request a deferral for one month.

So we can come back in January and explain both the minor changes as well as some of the text issues that we wanted to address.

[Speaker 1] (49:00 - 49:15)
Thank you, Patrick. Can I have a motion to defer this item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderman Waguesack makes the motion to defer.

Any objections? Hearing none, this item will be deferred to hopefully January. And more substantive changes too.

[Speaker 22] (49:17 - 49:18)
Except for January.

[Speaker 1] (49:18 - 49:29)
Okay, I'm sure we've heard from our zoning attorneys about some of the issues with next year. I know I have. Let's go on.

[Speaker 13] (49:31 - 49:33)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (49:36 - 49:59)
Next item is ordinance number 02022-3729. The amendment of ordinance 02022-1869 zoning reclassification map of number 14-H at 1920 through 1924 West 59th Street. Patrick, our zoning administrator, Patrick Murphy, would you speak on this item, please?

[Speaker 34] (49:59 - 50:26)
Sure, Patrick Murphy, the Department of Planning. This was a private application for a daycare. All of the exhibits and other details of the ordinance that were drafted by the applicant were all correct, except they excluded the one measurement that is underlined in the ordinance subject to this request.

So this simply fixes the ordinance by putting in the correct dimensional distance. It doesn't change anything of the ordinance, doesn't change anything on the map, doesn't change any aspect of the project itself. It just fixes an error from the private application.

[Speaker 1] (50:28 - 50:29)
And this is in what ward?

[Speaker 13] (50:32 - 50:33)
Give me two seconds.

[Speaker 34] (50:35 - 50:43)
Was it in? Was it? Okay, it is in 15th.

Sorry, I couldn't remember if it was here or you just brought it up to ask. Okay, the Alderman is knowledgeable. Where is he?

We discussed earlier. Raymond.

[Speaker 1] (50:47 - 50:48)
Any comment on this?

[Speaker 34] (50:48 - 50:49)
Just move to pass German.

[Speaker 1] (50:50 - 53:26)
All right. So any other questions? If not, Alderman Lopez makes the motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections to that motion? Hearing none, the item is passed. All right.

Now we're up on last up on the addendum are large signs over 100 square feet in area 24 feet above grade. We will hear them all together. I will read the ward followed by the address and take a motion at the end.

Two signs in the 11th Ward located at 3700 South Morgan Street. One sign in the 28th Ward located at 513 South Damon Avenue one sign in the 43rd Ward located at 667 West diversity Parkway. Lastly, once one sign also in the 43rd Ward located at 625 West diversity Parkway.

Any questions by committee members? Hearing none, Alderman Villegas makes a motion move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that?

Hearing none, these orders are passed. We'll now move on to the regular agenda in effort to ensure that the committee meeting runs as smoothly as possible. The typical order in which items will be heard has been updated.

Items will be grouped together according to witness attorney and will be heard in that order rather than in the typical ward order. All right, now where are we at? Okay, let me read it into the record.

This is on page one, document number 22001 in the 34th Ward. Ordinance was referred on October 26th of 2022. Common address is 1946 South Halstead and the change request from the B21.

Okay, B21 neighborhood mixed use district to C11 neighborhood commercial district. We have Julia Barnhart. Good morning Mr. Chairman. Identify yourself for the record and as for the member for the committee members, these items were discussed thoroughly at the last meeting, we'd ask to come back and rethink the zoning. So what I read into the record is what's here. We're going to hear from the witnesses and see if they've come up with a new zoning classification that might bring the projects together and have protections for the community.

[Speaker 15] (53:27 - 54:11)
Yes, good morning Mr. Chairman. My name is Kareem Musawwir. I'm a land use consultant, not an attorney.

On behalf of the applicant, precise consulting corporation and the owner here, Tiffany Kearney, Mr. Julia Barnhart, the attorney was not available today. This is a, as you indicated, we presented this last time. Now we have presented and revised amended ordinance, a substitute ordinance to replace the original ordinance to reduce that request from a C1-1 to a B3-1.

And there's also been an updated approval letter from the Alderman submitted with a change request.

[Speaker 1] (54:11 - 54:32)
All right, so Alderman Cardona moves to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum objections to that. Hearing none, now we have the, from the B2-1 to B3-1 and let's quickly talk about the use and think of some of the plan of operation that might be included with this also.

[Speaker 15] (54:32 - 54:35)
Yes, there has been a plan of operation drafted by the owner.

[Speaker 25] (54:38 - 54:46)
Hi, I'm Tiffany Kearney, owner of precise consulting corp. I did do a plan, create a plan of operation. I'm not sure if you guys have it.

[Speaker 1] (54:46 - 54:50)
We'll have it in the record. Obviously that's going to be with the license with the different.

[Speaker 25] (54:50 - 54:53)
Okay. So do I need to repeat everything from there?

[Speaker 1] (54:53 - 55:05)
No, but just give us a quick narrative of what you're planning to do. I think there was an issue in one of these two cases about parking and just quickly recap, please.

[Speaker 25] (55:05 - 56:13)
Okay. So before it was an issue of, they talked about a crime in an area, which I can do it, well not in that area, like a little further down that I hadn't, I couldn't do anything about and asked about BYOB and I was just telling them that I do, how do I feel about liquor? And I told them, I don't want a liquor license at all.

I don't want to serve liquor. In the plan of operation, I talked about, I'll make sure all laws and regulations regarding BYOB are abided by and premises security will ensure no customers are not overindulging. In my plan, I talked about a license will ensure no alcohol sales will be offered under any circumstances and there will be no sale of alcohol of any kind.

Security will abide by city of Chicago municipal codes, including not permitting customers to leave premises with open containers, alcohol beverages of that sort. I do have a, I don't like a certain amount of, I don't like a certain age group to rent, to rent the facility, the venue. So I try to keep it in a nice cordial age group and to make sure, you know, to try to keep things down.

That was probably pretty much everything.

[Speaker 1] (56:13 - 56:22)
All right. What's the size of this operation? Cause we have, we had two different sizes.

One was like 3,500 square feet. The other was 1600.

[Speaker 25] (56:22 - 56:33)
So it was a whole building. It's like 3000 square feet and I'm half of that. So it's a whole building, but at the size of your establishment.

Yeah. It was like 13 square feet.

[Speaker 1] (56:34 - 56:40)
Cause I know we had two of these and one was a little bit, cause it's a mixed use property.

[Speaker 25] (56:40 - 56:42)
So it's a residential at the top and it's commercial at the bottom.

[Speaker 1] (56:43 - 56:44)
Alderman Beal.

[Speaker 9] (56:45 - 56:53)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Being in an event space, what are you going to do with the second, the unit on top?

[Speaker 25] (56:53 - 57:08)
It is a been, it's residential. We have a, doing our permits. We reconstructed the building.

I reconstructed the whole building. We made sure it was soundproof. It was permitted and they made sure that I get, I'm sorry.

They came in and inspected to make sure that soundproof walls and all that's put upstairs.

[Speaker 9] (57:09 - 57:13)
Cause that would be a concern. You're renting the second floor and you're having an event on the first floor.

[Speaker 25] (57:13 - 57:15)
I actually have pictures of that.

[Speaker 9] (57:15 - 57:19)
Now, did you address the hours of operation?

[Speaker 25] (57:19 - 57:25)
Um, it was always between nine and 12. I don't, I'm not sure. Nine, 12 was always my hours of ending.

[Speaker 1] (57:26 - 57:29)
So I'm sorry. Could you say that into the hours of operation?

[Speaker 25] (57:29 - 57:38)
I'm sorry. I was operations is, um, nine to 12 midnight. It was always about 9 AM.

Yeah. It's like 12 midnight. Yes.

It was always that. Yeah. I've never changed.

[Speaker 1] (57:39 - 57:39)
I'm just with the question.

[Speaker 25] (57:39 - 57:42)
I just want to, I've never changed those hours. I've always been from nine to 12 midnight.

[Speaker 1] (57:43 - 57:44)
All right.

[Speaker 9] (57:44 - 58:05)
Well, I, um, um, appreciate you revising your plan of operation and listening to, uh, this committee and this council, uh, because we want the best for you and we want to make sure that you're successful, but at the same time, we want to make sure that the community is protected and, you know, we don't have any problems going forward. So I appreciate that. And we wish you the best of luck.

[Speaker 1] (58:05 - 58:53)
Thank you so much. Any other questions? All right.

Can I get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call? We just determined quorum Alderman Beal makes that motion objections to his motion hearing none. This item is passed as revised as amended.

I'm sorry. As amended. Good luck to you.

Thank you so much. All right. We have another one.

All right. Let me read it into the record, please. Page one, document number two, two zero one three T one 34th ward ordinance was referred October 26th of 2022.

Common address is four 15 West 107th street, 107th street. The change request from M one one limited manufacturing business park district to C one one neighborhood commercial district. Kareem.

[Speaker 15] (58:54 - 59:21)
Yes. Again, Mr. Kareem. We saw where I'm not an attorney.

I'm a land use consultant on this app application. You've given them leave for us to speak on behalf of mother love youth connection, LLC and the owner, Ms. Felicia Irvin is here as well. This is again in a substitute ordinance to reduce the request from an M one one to a C one one to that of a M one one to a B three one.

[Speaker 1] (59:21 - 59:38)
All right. Same thing. We need a motion to accept the substitute by the same roll call is used to determine quorum made by Alderman Cardona objections hearing none.

The substitute is before us. We also know is this, do I need to call for a type one?

[Speaker 15] (59:40 - 59:41)
This is a type one. Yes.

[Speaker 1] (59:42 - 1:00:05)
Okay. So then we'll have all the member boys moves to accept the substantive narrative plans for the type one application again, by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum objections to that. Okay.

So we have the substantive narrative plans are in front of us. We've got the zoning change and we have you and our proprietor. Yes.

See.

[Speaker 15] (1:00:06 - 1:00:42)
So, um, it's, uh, Irvin again has applied for the, um, uh, medium venue facility and as also, uh, request that it would be considered for an offsite parking lot, about 15 parking spaces across the street. That's part of the C one. And, uh, that would be the location where the required parking would be provided.

She's also submitted an application, excuse me, a plan of operation, which indicates the nature of how she inspects her, um, operator facility.

[Speaker 1] (1:00:43 - 1:00:53)
All right. Let's have some questions from many members. And by the way, uh, all the woman Austin's office is aware of both of these and we do have her support.

Correct?

[Speaker 15] (1:00:53 - 1:00:54)
Correct. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:00:54 - 1:01:00)
All right. Questions. Alderman Beal has some questions probably about the way you're going to thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 9] (1:01:01 - 1:01:08)
I've just, if you can answer the same question, um, about, uh, hours of operation and, um, you know, your, your plan of operation.

[Speaker 41] (1:01:10 - 1:01:15)
Well, I plan to have, uh, I'm sorry. Good morning.

[Speaker 1] (1:01:15 - 1:01:17)
Good morning. Um, your name, please.

[Speaker 41] (1:01:17 - 1:01:32)
Felicia Irvin and I'm doing a venue. Also my plan of operation is going to be from nine to 12, but I plan to have security cameras and security on premises at all times.

[Speaker 9] (1:01:34 - 1:01:46)
Okay. When you say all times, that means all times that there's a venue going on. Yes.

Okay. All right. Okay.

And, um, I mean, you're really close to a residential area.

[Speaker 41] (1:01:46 - 1:01:52)
And I have a misuse also, it's apartment upstairs, but it's not being rented at all.

[Speaker 9] (1:01:52 - 1:01:57)
Okay. So you have no plans to rent the second floor? No, sir.

And what about the parking issue?

[Speaker 41] (1:01:57 - 1:02:09)
I have a, um, a lease with the parking lot across, across the street from me is like 15 feet. I have a lease where I pay a monthly fee.

[Speaker 9] (1:02:09 - 1:02:12)
Okay. It's more like 45 feet, 50. Yeah.

[Speaker 41] (1:02:15 - 1:02:15)
Okay.

[Speaker 9] (1:02:17 - 1:02:37)
All right. Um, again, um, I appreciate you for listening to this body, listening to the committee, uh, and the community, and, uh, we want to wish you the best of luck. And, um, I think you're off to a great start by putting your best foot forward.

So we want to support you and wish you all the best success. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:02:37 - 1:03:01)
Other questions? Hearing none, Alderman Beal makes a motion, move do pass by the same roll call those used to determine form. Any objections?

Hearing none, this item is passed as amended with the substantive narrative and plans. Good luck to you. Thank you so much.

Thanks for your patience and working with us in the Alderman's office.

[Speaker 41] (1:03:01 - 1:03:01)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:03:01 - 1:05:03)
Okay. All right. Now we are on page two, top of page two.

This is Valley's casino document number two, one, one, two, nine, and the 27th ward ordinance was referred on September 21st of 2022. Common addresses 643 through 741 West Chicago Avenue, 641 through 739 North Halsted Street, 632 through 740 West Erie Street, 627 through 661 West Erie Street, 501 through 531 North Des Plaines and 524 through 630 West Grand Avenue. The change request is air rights waterway business residential plan development number 1426 to air rights waterway business residential plan development number 1426 as amended.

Okay, and we have Meg, and Chris Leach, Meg Georgia. Yeah. And all the Hopkins is here for purposes of quorum, and obviously is of interest to him.

So, what I'm going to do, if it's, if it's agreeable to my committee members. In the interest of time, this is an amendment to a casino proposal that we've seen. Again, and maybe again, we've had briefings.

I was part of the plan commission yesterday I think it was an hour and a half, if not, we will not spend an hour and a half on this today. I would like to edit this, if it's the will of the committee to about a half hour at most. And then I'm going to open it up more so for questions from committee members.

And I would like, as I said earlier, is to highlight the differences between the previously planned PD, and what we're bringing forth today. You know, so this should be not any new news about the casino. But what I'd like to concentrate is what are the significant changes.

[Speaker 6] (1:05:05 - 1:05:16)
Before, and we'll start with you may understood and thank you alderman I will keep my comments very brief as we're going to incorporate the record from yesterday, but again we do have a PowerPoint ready to answer specific questions.

[Speaker 1] (1:05:16 - 1:05:31)
Let me start by incorporating the records of the plan commission, but the same roll call that was used to determine form. Alderman Vegas makes that motion to incorporate the records any objections to that hearing on the records are incorporated, and we can continue.

[Speaker 6] (1:05:32 - 1:06:27)
Thank you. Good morning Mr Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Meg George an attorney with the law firm of Aikerman LLP.

I'm appearing this morning on behalf of the applicant Valley Chicago operating company LLC, in connection with application number 21129. The subject property is located along the Chicago River between Chicago Avenue on the north and Grand Avenue on the south. The property is located within existing plan development number 1426.

My client seeks to amend this plan development in order to allow Chicago's first casino, which would be located in a new entertainment district. The proposal includes the 1 million square foot casino building, a 500 room hotel 3000 seat event center museum, the build out of new roads, a full site extension of the Chicago Riverwalk bicycle pedestrian and water taxi connectivity, several infrastructure improvements, and a significant amount of.

[Speaker 1] (1:06:28 - 1:06:45)
Okay, let me just start with something. Sure. So, as Alderman Burnett will attest to this previously planned development.

Go back to the last site with the density that was previously proved well before casino was in front of us so just go back.

[Speaker 13] (1:06:46 - 1:06:47)
I don't have the.

[Speaker 1] (1:06:48 - 1:07:33)
Yeah, go back. That one. Okay, so obviously, does not look that today.

Okay, but this was a previously planned with the Tribune site that allowed this type of density. Well before the casino was imagined. And so, this is what the casino, and with the potential for all the density there because there were a lot of questions about the density and such and such but what we're here today is not going back and revisiting the redo of the Tribune site but to talk specifically, we've already done the casino but then there are changes to that but I just wanted to put everything kind of kind of in a historical perspective.

[Speaker 6] (1:07:33 - 1:10:22)
Yeah, thank you very much. Present with me this morning are Chris Jewett, Amit Patel and Joanne McKeel of Bally's. Our architect, landscape architect, civil engineer and traffic consultant are here as well.

Together we are requesting your support and approval of this plan development amendment. Proposed amendment will maintain the boundaries of the existing plan development. The proposed casino use is currently an allowed use in the plan development in the category of entertainment and spectator sports.

This amendment is necessitated by the change to the sub areas, change to the bulk table, and new site and building layouts. The previous plan development allowed for a maximum of 8.4 million square feet of new mixed use development. Bally's proposal would significantly reduce the allowable square footage by 1.8 million square feet for a maximum of 6.6 million square feet. The first phase of the project will include the casino, hotel, museum, event space, riverwalk extension, park space, new infrastructure, and roadway improvements. The future phase, as Alderman Tunney just referred to, would allow for the construction of up to 4,799 residential units, 300 additional hotel keys, 125,000 square feet of retail, additional infrastructure improvements, and park space. And those improvements would require site plan approval by the Department of Planning and Development and a courtesy presentation to the Chicago Plan Commission.

The proposed plans have been designed in compliance with the Affordable Housing Ordinance, the Sustainable Development Policy, the North Branch Framework Plan, and the Chicago River Guidelines. This proposal thoughtfully incorporates the input received from over 50 meetings Bally's held with the community and constituent groups. This casino will be the first major casino in the country to be built by a minority-led firm.

Bally's has partnered with the Chicago Community Builders Collective to further its aggressive goals for construction and permanent employment. The project will bring approximately 3,000 construction jobs and 3,000 permanent jobs. Bally's plans to use 36% MBE and 10% WBE certified firms.

50% of the work hours will be performed by City of Chicago residents, 15.5% of which will be completed by residents who come from socially and economically disadvantaged areas. With respect to employee hiring, Bally's seeks to employ 60% minorities and 45% women. We have worked extensively with the Department of Planning and Development, the Department of Transportation, and the Alderman to develop the proposed project.

Representatives from these departments and Alderman Burnett are here today. We thank Alderman Burnett and the City Departments for their hard work on this project and look forward to the continued partnership with them. On behalf of Bally's, we respectfully request your favorable consideration of this amendment and the team and I are here to answer any questions that you may have.

[Speaker 1] (1:10:24 - 1:10:49)
Well, that was 11 minutes and seven or so, so we're going to give it. Thank you. I know you have a plethora of experts and we also have numerous people from our departments to answer questions and I know that we're going to close with Alderman Burnett.

That's your wish. Would you like to say an opening? No?

Okay, so let's have some questions.

[Speaker 13] (1:10:49 - 1:10:56)
All right, Alderman Beall. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 9] (1:10:58 - 1:11:03)
First, let me ask, what's your minority makeup of the team right now?

[Speaker 13] (1:11:05 - 1:11:14)
Chris, can you answer that question? Not yet. We'll see the group.

Now you're on.

[Speaker 1] (1:11:15 - 1:11:17)
So we're in the- Identify again yourself.

[Speaker 3] (1:11:17 - 1:11:28)
Chris Jewell with Bally's, Vice President of Corporate Development. So as of right now, we have 11 or 12 associates on the team. About half are trending in the minority population.

Trending?

[Speaker 13] (1:11:29 - 1:11:39)
Yeah, what does trending mean? So we have six women out of 12, four black and an Indian.

[Speaker 3] (1:11:39 - 1:11:55)
So we're about 50 percent minority and about 40 percent women today. That's 12 employees. We'll have 700 in the temporary casino and about 3,000 in the permanent.

Okay, so the team that's working on right now, where is your minority participation?

[Speaker 9] (1:11:56 - 1:12:06)
The only person that is in those 12 people is right here next to me. Okay, all right. So you have no African-Americans right now on the team at all?

[Speaker 13] (1:12:06 - 1:12:07)
No, we do. We do.

[Speaker 9] (1:12:07 - 1:12:16)
Okay, all right. So let me ask, you said you're going to meet 60, your goal is 60 percent.

[Speaker 3] (1:12:16 - 1:12:42)
Do you think that's realistic? We do based on the demographics of the city, absolutely. So we operate for background, we operate 15 casinos throughout the country today.

Our employees are highly representative of the demographic of the local population. So a couple of examples, in Vicksburg, Mississippi, we're over 70 percent minorities. In Biloxi, we're over 60 percent.

[Speaker 9] (1:12:43 - 1:12:52)
Okay, I've never seen in my 24 years of being in office a development with 60 percent minority participation.

[Speaker 3] (1:12:54 - 1:12:58)
No, we understand it's a high commitment level, but we're committed to it.

[Speaker 9] (1:12:58 - 1:13:48)
It's almost unrealistic because we've been fighting for minority participation my entire career, and I've never seen numbers come close to 60 percent. So I understand your goal, but I your goal is unrealistic, and I think you need to revisit you saying that because I don't think that's an accurate statement that you're going to hit that 60 percent. But I do know that the local alderman over there is adamant about it, and I know he's going to strive for it, but I've just never seen it.

My second question is, where are you at in the process with the gaming board in Springfield? Chris, we're still going through the review process with the Illinois gaming board. Okay, and what do you anticipate that process playing out as far as the timeline?

[Speaker 3] (1:13:49 - 1:13:52)
I can't speak for the review timeline specifically.

[Speaker 9] (1:13:52 - 1:14:15)
Okay, so if you can't speak to the timeline, why are we in such a rush to get this passed today when, you know, we passed plan commission yesterday, and then we're rushing in here today? What's the rush when we know that the gaming board, we don't know what their timeline is, and you can't break ground until gaming board approves it. So why are we in such a hurry?

[Speaker 6] (1:14:15 - 1:14:56)
Correct. This is a massive development that will require months and years of design before we get to actual construction, and that process really needs to start now, and that's what we've been working so hard with the Department of Planning and Development on in the last seven months is to develop those plans, but there are, as you saw and heard yesterday, there are, you know, half a mile or more of roadway improvements that we have to coordinate.

There are dedications, vacations, easements, all of that work that will need to occur prior to construction, and so we are really enjoying, and Vakil can speak more directly to this, really bumping right on that timeline for construction.

[Speaker 20] (1:15:00 - 1:15:44)
Thank you, Meg. My name is Joanne Vakil. I'm the Senior Vice President of Design and Development for Valleys.

In terms of our development process, as Meg was referring to, we are also planning a lot of our infrastructure development in conjunction with all the development that are happening by the city along Chicago Avenue as well, and some of the improvements that are being planned for Halstead. In addition, it is important for a project of this nature, and the complex nature, and the aggressive timelines we have, it is important to achieve all of the required approvals so that we are able to accomplish all of the design process and align ourselves in the timeline that has been committed to as well.

[Speaker 9] (1:15:44 - 1:15:51)
Okay, well help me understand that if we held this, what would stop you off and continue to plan?

[Speaker 6] (1:15:54 - 1:16:04)
So we need to start getting permits and really start working through that. We can't release the architects, and consultants, and planners to finalize those plans until there's entitlement approval.

[Speaker 9] (1:16:05 - 1:16:16)
But you can't get permits until all your plans are done. My point is you can still plan, and you can still do the engineering, the architecture, you can still do all of that without zoning approval.

[Speaker 6] (1:16:17 - 1:16:20)
Joanna, if you can speak to milestones you need to hit before you release.

[Speaker 20] (1:16:20 - 1:16:42)
Sure, absolutely. So in order to make sure that we are planning in conjunction and based on the approvals that we would be seeking at a zoning level, planning level, which are one of the first steps that we need to accomplish so that all of the construction documents all the way through the process are being accomplished so that when

[Speaker 9] (1:16:42 - 1:17:38)
we are permit ready, we are aligned with the approvals that we would seek and we would gain. All right, I just, you know, I believe that, you know, this is a rush job, and I believe that when you rush, you're going to make mistakes along the way. And, you know, until the gaming board approves this process, I mean, you all could be spinning your wheels for not.

The gaming board may not even approve the location. And so I think we, you know, really need to pause and, you know, slow this train down before it becomes a train wreck. Because I think we're definitely headed towards that if we don't get this thing right.

And I just think that this is more of a political process than a common sense process. And so I think we're just trying to score political points unnecessarily. And I think at the end of the day, we're going to make some mistakes.

So that's just my two cents.

[Speaker 13] (1:17:39 - 1:17:39)
So thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:17:40 - 1:17:43)
Thank you, Alderman Beal. Alderman David Moore.

[Speaker 13] (1:17:48 - 1:17:55)
Thanks, Chairman. Well, I don't have any really questions surrounding, you know, this ordinance here.

[Speaker 22] (1:17:55 - 1:18:33)
But the overall, when we request items, you know, I respect to get them. So in order for me to continue to vote and support this on May 9, at one of our meetings, I requested through the chair, we had, you know, had talked about a list of vending sources that you all are going to put out like snowblowers, window cleaners, food and beverage landscaping. And I asked for that whole complete list through the chair on May 9.

I still haven't received that yet. On December...

[Speaker 1] (1:18:33 - 1:18:44)
Let me just say, has that been provided? We have? The question is the list of the extensive list of vendors, window cleaners to...

[Speaker 22] (1:18:44 - 1:18:48)
Well, they may not have the vendors, the individuals on, but the jobs, I think that...

[Speaker 1] (1:18:48 - 1:18:49)
Job titles.

[Speaker 22] (1:18:49 - 1:18:56)
Yes, that they were... And if they have the vendors, then fine. But it was like the snow plows, they're going to do window cleaning.

[Speaker 1] (1:18:57 - 1:19:05)
So they're going to have food and beverage, they're going to have landscaping. I'll stand corrected, it was the job titles. And I believe we have an answer for that.

Do we have that list?

[Speaker 3] (1:19:07 - 1:19:27)
This is Chris Jewel with Valley. So I believe back in May, the question was what were the vendor types that we were soliciting. I believe we actually submitted those to the city.

If not, we can double check and get those out today. It's a pretty long list. From a job title standpoint, I know during the aldermanic briefings this past Friday, that was brought up.

[Speaker 13] (1:19:27 - 1:19:32)
And then in a prior meeting with some folks in one of the other wards I was asked for, that was submitted last night.

[Speaker 1] (1:19:33 - 1:19:37)
So I see our CFO, Jenny, do you have your...

[Speaker 13] (1:19:41 - 1:19:44)
Can you hear me? Jenny Bennett, the CFO, for the record.

[Speaker 19] (1:19:44 - 1:19:48)
I understand that those items were provided to the chair alderman, and we can make sure to re-up that for you.

[Speaker 13] (1:19:48 - 1:19:49)
All right.

[Speaker 22] (1:19:49 - 1:20:08)
And I think what Chris was talking about on December 9th was of the $100 million that's been spent thus far, how much was spent as of December 9th, which was that date, and to whom and by ethnicity. So I requested that as well, and I haven't seen that yet.

[Speaker 1] (1:20:10 - 1:20:20)
Well, let me just make sure that we will get... Supposedly it's somewhere in the cloud, so to speak. We will make sure we get that to you, David.

[Speaker 3] (1:20:20 - 1:21:13)
Okay, hopefully. It's Chris Jewett, if I could touch on that. We submitted that last night.

We were pulling a list of vendors and groups together. So to touch on the numbers to date, we're just south of $20 million on the design and construction. As a reminder, our commitment within the host community agreement or contract with the city is to meet a 36% MBE participation and a 10% WBE participation.

As it stands, we're about 44% on that 19 or 20 million. Today, 44% MBE and about 6% or so WBE. Now reminder, this is a $1.3 billion commitment as it relates to that spend specifically with WBE and MBE partners. So we're less than 1% of the way there and we're still exceeding the target.

[Speaker 1] (1:21:14 - 1:21:14)
David.

[Speaker 22] (1:21:15 - 1:21:24)
Again, I appreciate that, but just provide... Understood. ...through the chair. Let me get a copy so I can go through it. Thank you so much.

[Speaker 7] (1:21:24 - 1:21:25)
Thanks, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:21:25 - 1:21:27)
All right. Alderman Raymond Lopez.

[Speaker 7] (1:21:29 - 1:21:52)
Thank you, Chairman. And again, good morning, members of the committee. Good morning, Bally's and company.

I just want to make sure that we're all clear and especially our guests are clear. Today's conversation isn't about the casino. It's about the 1.6 million square feet that will be used for the 4,799 dwelling units, correct?

[Speaker 6] (1:21:55 - 1:22:00)
Beg George to make right. Yes, that is correct. The dwelling units will be coming in a future phase, not in the first phase.

[Speaker 7] (1:22:00 - 1:22:09)
So if I may ask, where on our graph is... Will these 4,800 units be located?

[Speaker 6] (1:22:10 - 1:22:16)
Right now we have a placeholder, but in a future phase, a developer...

[Speaker 7] (1:22:16 - 1:22:19)
I'm sorry. Hold on. Let's let Bennett get to it first.

Okay.

[Speaker 13] (1:22:21 - 1:22:31)
So in a future phase, a developer would come in for site plan approval with a proposal for specific buildings and specific unit counts on site.

[Speaker 7] (1:22:35 - 1:22:51)
So if we are looking at the proposed amendment on the right, are we assuming that what was formerly the yellow squares on the left would have been the locations for the dwelling units that are being discussed?

[Speaker 6] (1:22:51 - 1:22:58)
That is correct. And you can see on the right, we have placeholder buildings in for where those residential units could be located.

[Speaker 7] (1:22:59 - 1:23:09)
But this is not set in stone. This is just all... We're just throwing the number as a placeholder.

This whole location or design could be completely different.

[Speaker 6] (1:23:09 - 1:23:34)
So we have design guidelines in the plan development that control how it can be designed and the bulk that could be... Where the bulk could be put on the site. However, there's site plan approval language in the plan development, which would require definitive plans to come through the Department of Planning and Development and through the plan commission for review.

At that time, they come online.

[Speaker 7] (1:23:35 - 1:23:48)
And Chairman, perhaps the department can explain, is that the normal procedure for when we have 5,000 units awaiting approval for this body to be without any kind of oversight?

[Speaker 1] (1:23:49 - 1:24:26)
All right. Let me just say there's one thing we actually did forget in your presentation was the removal of the parking facility at Chicago and Halstead that was part of the original casino structured building. And now you'll have surface parking in the interim and then figure out a new building with parking in it at one of these buildings at Chicago and Halstead.

That was a substantive change in the previous casino approved plan.

[Speaker 6] (1:24:26 - 1:24:29)
Right. From the original proposal, not from the original PD.

[Speaker 1] (1:24:29 - 1:24:42)
You're right. Right. But that again, and we'll get to that in a second, but I just want to make sure we're going to answer who from the city is going to...

Noah, you want to answer Alderman Lopez's question and then we'll get on.

[Speaker 32] (1:24:42 - 1:25:53)
Absolutely, Chairman. Noah Sofranik, Assistant Commissioner with the Department of Planning and Development. So yes, it's very typical for projects that are this large and have multiple sub areas to come in with one phase, sometimes even none of the phases, fully built out or planned or designed, and then have checks and balances in place so that each of those parcels as they come online can measure the impacts as they continue to accrue.

And so that we can ensure that there is traffic impact mitigation, planning development and mitigation, review of the design standards. So what the PD carries is what the attorney just mentioned, which is site plan approval language to ensure that it'll come back for a courtesy presentation to receive comments from the plan commission, and then through the department administrative process to amend those exhibits accordingly as they come online. What's included in the PD is a general framework.

It encompasses most of the improvements for streets and roadways that are necessary to take those separate parcels and then build upon them. And then specifics will be added as we go. But phase one for the casino in its entirety is ready to go.

So the Jefferson Street that they mentioned will be built as part of phase one, the Riverwalk is phase one, the Riverwalk Park, Riverfront Park is phase one, and the casino events is all done in phase one.

[Speaker 7] (1:25:53 - 1:27:39)
Well, thank you. And I think my question was more so I mean, the casino aspect of it, the casino building, the casino proper, for lack of better term, is already basically 99% set in stone except for the eliminated parking garage. But my concern would be what is going to happen when you have 5000 new dwelling units and 5000 families in that small little area where you don't have individuals who have a traffic study now who didn't get a traffic study for this casino, and are going to be presented with no option to address this with their local aldermen in the future when these phases start getting rolling out, because what we're seeing is not guaranteed. What we're seeing could be completely and utterly different five years from now when you finally start breaking ground. And you're going to have not the 5000 people moving in, but you're going to have the 20,000 impacted people severely pissed off that they have no option to discuss this with people who are elected to make decisions.

So I open to the residents that exist in this area, because we've all heard when this conversation was going people's concerns about the congestion and density of what was going on just with visitors. And now to say you're going to have 5000 new home, new families with already strained parking options and street options. But at the mercy of an unelected bureaucratic body, that just makes me very nervous.

And it should make us all very nervous. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:27:39 - 1:27:40)
All right.

[Speaker 6] (1:27:40 - 1:27:42)
I believe Noah was going to do that.

[Speaker 1] (1:27:42 - 1:27:46)
No, and you want to get Chairman, I just want to Alderman Vegas after that.

[Speaker 32] (1:27:46 - 1:28:07)
Just correct one aspect of that. So the traffic study was prepared is it does now appear on our casino website was done for the full extent of the build out. So it does take into account in the future what would happen if all 4,799 units were built.

If all the office space retail space is contemplated, we're built out to the full 6.6 million square feet. So the traffic site does account for all that.

[Speaker 1] (1:28:08 - 1:28:09)
All right, Alderman Vegas.

[Speaker 10] (1:28:11 - 1:28:16)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Did the did you guys mentioned about the underground parking as well?

[Speaker 6] (1:28:17 - 1:29:09)
So we can so Meg George attorney for valleys. Originally, in the plan, there was an offsite parking lot across the street, actually, where you can see kind of in that upper left hand corner, we met with the committee on design, and they had asked that we put the parking underground and not an open up that corner. And so the design team really went to work and put that underneath the building so that we would not have that.

The HCA required 3300 parking spaces. But we would like to not have this be over parked. And so we have allowed for a surface parking lot, which you can see there it says temp parking, where we could build out all of those spaces on site for employees.

And then if a residential building does get constructed there, those would be put into the base of that building.

[Speaker 10] (1:29:09 - 1:29:10)
Okay, thank you for that clarification.

[Speaker 1] (1:29:11 - 1:29:25)
And I mentioned that that was Chicago and Halsted, right? Yeah. And now that is not going to be a structured parking, right?

If it ever gets developed, which I believe it will be, it'll be have some substantive parking and, you know, mixed use in the in that building also. Yeah.

[Speaker 10] (1:29:25 - 1:30:03)
Thank you, Chairman. So I wanted to, maybe this question is for DPD, but is there, is there a PMO, from the city's perspective, making sure that this project is going to be on, on, on budget on, you know, on time, etc. Because we do have, we are we are counting on revenue that's going to be generated from this, from this casino, to be done in a timely fashion.

And so I want to make sure that there's a PMO because we've heard Lincoln yards, we've heard 78 to no fruition. And I think that had there been a PMO for the city side, kind of working collaboratively with the with those developers, that we could have we could have actually had some of these projects come to fruition.

[Speaker 1] (1:30:03 - 1:30:13)
So is there a benefit for the benefit of the committee PMO means a project manager, project manager for it's a in budget on time, correct? Okay.

[Speaker 13] (1:30:15 - 1:30:26)
Yes. Our CFO, Jenny Ben. Can you hear me?

Okay.

[Speaker 19] (1:30:27 - 1:31:17)
I wanted to say that the, you know, casino project is a unique project. It's not just a development project as we're usually used to seeing, but it also includes a number of other aspects. As you noted, there's a significant revenue component.

There, there's an equity component, a jobs component. So ultimately, all of that is encapsulated within the host community agreement, which is the agreement between the city of Chicago and valleys to uphold the commitments of all of the various aspects of the project. Within that host community agreement, the CFO is the designated person to then ensure that those requirements are met and to manage through that.

But ultimately, we rely on a number of other departments, including DPD C dot, and others to ensure that the project is completed successfully.

[Speaker 10] (1:31:17 - 1:32:19)
So this project is a, this infrastructure projects like 1.7 billion, right? So just to put it in reference, the airport is 8 billion and they have a dedicated PMO that works, that works as the owner's rep, making sure that everything is done has this. I understand that the CFO and some of the city members are going to be responsible for this, but I can tell you that when you're talking about nearly a $2 billion project, we do not have the staff necessary internally to manage this project.

Um, as, as on the owner side from us, the city to make sure that the project is done in a fashion where we can collect those revenues that we're going to be ultimately counting on for moving forward with our budget. So I think, I think it'd be, it'd be who of us as a, as a, the city to make sure that we have a PMO that's working on our side to make sure that we're on track because we are going to be counting on some of these revenues. And I know that, uh, with a $2 billion project, a quarter of the size of O'Hare remodelization, and it's going to be even compressed because we want it quicker.

[Speaker 13] (1:32:31 - 1:32:32)
On the, on the project right now.

[Speaker 19] (1:32:32 - 1:32:42)
And as the project begins to ramp up, we're going to work to, um, you know, build up that, uh, institution to support that. Um, we do need the support and the help to make this work. And I appreciate your comments on that.

[Speaker 10] (1:32:44 - 1:32:59)
Again, I just want to put on the record that I think the city needs to get a PMO. Um, as it relates to some of the, uh, uh, food, food and beverage restaurants and stuff like that, my understanding is like 22 restaurants that are part of this casino, approximately.

[Speaker 6] (1:33:01 - 1:33:03)
Amit Patel from Valleys can speak to this.

[Speaker 13] (1:33:06 - 1:33:09)
There you go. Yeah. Can you hear me?

Yes, sir. Yes.

[Speaker 20] (1:33:09 - 1:33:28)
Amit Patel from Valleys. Yes. We have a pretty extensive operation that we're planning to, to start here with, uh, you know, the bars, the food halls, the steak houses.

Um, so you'll have the complete variety of amenities that you would traditionally have in a casino environment and the things that we've committed to in our HC as well.

[Speaker 10] (1:33:28 - 1:34:53)
Have, have you guys made a determination as to who those operators are going to be yet, or is there going to be an RFP process or how's that going to work? We have not made the determination and yes, we will have an independent RFP process running through that. Cool.

And then again, that's what I put on the record. This is something I've talked about it, uh, at planning everywhere I can around the investment opportunity. I want to make sure that I know that, uh, you guys are in front of the Illinois gaming board with the crowdfunding, um, option, uh, to get minority and women investing in this casino.

This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. I want to make sure that Chicagoans, um, have the opportunity. I want to make sure that African-Americans, Latinos, women, Asians have that opportunity to invest in this and show meaningful.

I know that it's in the statute, but the way you're approaching it with crowdfunding, um, I'm just have a little bit of concerns on that. So I'm waiting to see what the Illinois gaming board says, but obviously you have an option B and what I would hope that, um, you're, um, making those relationships or trying to make those relationships with those folks that could, that could invest in this casino. Cool.

Um, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I, again, this is, and I appreciate the valleys team. Um, uh, uh, they met with, um, uh, little portions of the Eastern ward that I'm picking up that are about 10 blocks away from this.

They had some concerns, they talked about it and put forth some ideas. And, uh, so they've been in communication. So I appreciate the willingness of, of, of valleys to, uh, have that dialogue.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:34:54 - 1:34:59)
Thank you. Alderman Mike Rodriguez. Thank you, Mr. Chair.

[Speaker 21] (1:35:00 - 1:36:10)
Um, first of all, I just want to reiterate, uh, that I'm proud to support the brothers and sisters in labor who are here with us today. Thank you very much for your presence. And, uh, you are the backbone of our city, um, regards to the, the, uh, ownership structure.

Um, I think we've heard a lot about that. I'm a little bit more interested in the, on the downstream kind of supports that were just articulated. Um, and, um, wondering if there could be a little bit more depth in the conversation as it relates to, um, those businesses, uh, small businesses who will be involved here.

If you can articulate that a little bit more, as far as number, if there are any targets in engagement with, uh, diverse communities, um, underrepresented communities, and then also if there's any estimates on area impacts, uh, of these investments, because I think whatever we pass here has multiplier impacts that need to be clearly articulated. So, um, if you could take a couple of minutes to articulate some of those impacts.

[Speaker 13] (1:36:16 - 1:36:19)
Uh, Chris Jewett with Bally's. So I think there were three points.

[Speaker 3] (1:36:19 - 1:38:14)
One was, uh, small businesses and how we plan to incorporate them into our plans and partner. Um, as part of our bid, as part of our bid, can you hear me? As, as part of our bid, we made a commitment to small and local businesses.

You know, our goal all along has been to try and keep as much of our business from a tax dollar standpoint, from a vendor spend standpoint within the city of Chicago and within the state of Illinois, uh, that will continue to be, be our goal and our commitment. But that being said, as part of the bid, we committed to rolling out a, uh, community rewards program whereby our, our customers and our patrons, uh, when they come in and play and participate in, you know, casino ventures gaming, uh, specifically they'll earn rewards points. Um, those rewards points, our goal is to partner with local businesses, small minority owned.

Uh, so our, our patrons can actually use those points outside of the four walls of the casino and add small businesses like your local salon, like your local barber shop, like your local florist. Um, that's never been done before. So that, that is in the works.

Um, additionally from a vendor diversity standpoint, we've, we've committed to 41%, uh, of vendor spent on an ongoing annual basis being with minority women, uh, veteran and disabled owned businesses. Um, those are city requirements and those are the loftiest goals of any within the city or within the state of Illinois, as it relates to casinos. Um, and thirdly, from a dollar impact, I don't have specific numbers in front of me today as part of our RFP process, we did go through a full, uh, feasibility and economic impact study, which was submitted.

I know I recall seeing numbers, uh, in the city's evaluation report. Those numbers believe were pulled directly from, uh, the economic impact studies that we had submitted. Uh, but I'm sure we can get you those.

[Speaker 21] (1:38:16 - 1:39:17)
Yeah, I think either through the chair, we've seen those. So I'm, I'm glad you're referencing them. I think the best of these types of developments have a holistic view on the impacts that they have, not just in your development, but in the areas around it and continue to articulate that and getting on a record on that is my interest.

Um, particularly coming from a community that's, you know, one of the top grossing small business districts in the city of Chicago. Um, I'm very, very interested in small businesses getting their piece of the pie as well. I did hear a lot of talk around ownership and those folks who are at the top of the table, and I'm glad that that conversation's happening, but I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I continue to be interested in those downstream impacts and also on the labor force.

Um, I think that's clear. That's been articulated very well. Um, and the folks who've spoken in favor of this, uh, endeavor today have also clearly talked about that impact.

And it's, it's very much swayed me in my thinking about my support of this project. So thank you, Mr. Chair, for the opportunity.

[Speaker 13] (1:39:19 - 1:39:25)
Okay. Other questions that yes.

[Speaker 1] (1:39:26 - 1:39:27)
Alderman Riley.

[Speaker 5] (1:39:29 - 1:40:03)
All right. The floor is yours. Thank you, chairman.

Thank you colleagues. And I'm not going to reiterate all the past arguments that I've made about flawed traffic studies and the lack of a public safety plan. Um, and what I consider to be an inherently flawed process, but, um, I do have a few questions that, um, I wanted to ask for the record as we're preparing this for the Illinois gaming boards review.

Um, first question is when did valleys complete the traffic study in support of the permanent casino?

[Speaker 6] (1:40:08 - 1:40:41)
Meg George, uh, Ackerman, uh, the traffic that we've been working with CEDA pretty much every single week, if not multiple times a week on this traffic study, it was, um, substantially completed and then additional, uh, counts and intersections were reviewed. The final, uh, traffic study was submitted, uh, last week with conditional approval from CEDA. Their CEDA is obviously here today and can speak to their review and oversight of it.

It's now the traffic study is available, I believe on online, uh, publicly.

[Speaker 5] (1:40:42 - 1:40:43)
So when was the study completed?

[Speaker 13] (1:40:46 - 1:40:49)
It was the final approval was, was last week.

[Speaker 6] (1:40:49 - 1:41:17)
We had, I would say substantially completed it, uh, probably, probably a month or so ago. And then additional counts were requested and, and information requested. There are a few changes.

Um, every time the committee on design or planning and development had a change to the plans, we updated the traffic study. So it was updated and changed several times. Um, and it is, uh, was most recently submitted and approved by CEDA, uh, last week.

[Speaker 5] (1:41:17 - 1:41:22)
And when was that traffic study delivered to the aldermen who represent impacted constituents?

[Speaker 6] (1:41:26 - 1:41:32)
I believe it was, um, put on the website. I know, and CEDA can speak to when it was publicly available.

[Speaker 5] (1:41:32 - 1:41:41)
No, no, no. My question is when was it delivered to the local aldermen, Alderman Burnett and Alderman Riley? Not when was it publicly posted for all to see?

[Speaker 42] (1:41:44 - 1:41:44)
I, I don't.

[Speaker 5] (1:41:44 - 1:42:16)
I'll answer the question. It was 11 a.m. yesterday morning, probably around the time it went on the website and during the middle of the Chicago plan commission proceedings to approve this item that's before us now, chairman. They didn't even have the traffic study at plan commission.

Um, typically our process around here is that a traffic study is prepared, approved and reviewed and vetted well ahead of plan commission, let alone a zoning committee approval. Um, so once again, we're turning process on its head here.

[Speaker 1] (1:42:17 - 1:42:22)
Um, let me interrupt for a second. You, you have the traffic consultant with you today?

[Speaker 5] (1:42:22 - 1:42:24)
And I don't need to speak to this consultant chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:42:24 - 1:42:57)
What I do want to mention though, is we are amending this today. The traffic study is an ongoing, but to answer Alderman Riley's questions, there had been traffic studies submitted well in advance, um, at the previous zoning and or plan commission. And what are the, that was for the, that was for the temporary site chairman.

No, no, let's Chris, I believe we, I believe we had it for the Halstead in Chicago site too.

[Speaker 3] (1:43:02 - 1:43:23)
But with values as part of the RFP process, uh, both the temporary and the permanent sites for, I believe for all bidders, uh, it was a requirement that there was a traffic study submitted. So we had completed one originally, um, back in our submission back in October of 2021. So this has been an evolution as the design has changed on the site itself.

[Speaker 5] (1:43:24 - 1:44:14)
Alderman Riley. Chairman, that was a traffic analysis and it was a really thin document. I think even by the applicant's own admission, it was deficient and required more work, which is why I think they continued to work on their study, not just because their plans were changing.

Um, one of the things I want to point out here is that both for the temporary site and the, and the permanent, um, the traffic consultants claim that they built their studies around modeling against similar casinos and large cities like Chicago. So I would like for the applicant to provide us with a few examples of large cities like Chicago that have casinos in their central business districts. I just like to know what cities were compared to, because that's what you used to model your traffic studies by your own admission.

[Speaker 6] (1:44:14 - 1:44:18)
Alderman Riley and Chair, we can have our traffic consultant speak to.

[Speaker 13] (1:44:19 - 1:44:24)
We can have our traffic consultant speak to Alderman Riley's question, if that's acceptable. Sure.

[Speaker 38] (1:44:33 - 1:44:34)
Good morning.

[Speaker 5] (1:44:34 - 1:44:34)
Morning.

[Speaker 38] (1:44:34 - 1:44:59)
Here we go. Mr. Chairman, good morning, Alderman Riley. My name is Tim Doran.

I'm the senior traffic consultant with Fish Transportation Group, a woman owned business enterprise. Are, if you're referring, I believe you are Alderman Riley, I believe you are to the temporary site. Am I correct?

And the urban, uh, casino site there. I'm a little confused as to your question.

[Speaker 5] (1:45:00 - 1:45:28)
Okay. Well, to be clear, both the permanent and temporary sites are located in the central business district. For the, for the, for the temporary site, you made it clear that you were using, you're modeling your study against other major cities like Chicago that have casinos in their central business district.

Each of these two sites would be within our central business district. So assuming you did it for the temporary casino, I see, I assume you also did that for the permanent, correct?

[Speaker 38] (1:45:29 - 1:46:02)
We did, we did not. For the temporary casino, we used three special studies that were done in urban Philadelphia and Pittsburgh in the, in the urban area. For the permanent site, we used ITE, Institute of Transportation Engineers, that just recently came out with data on casinos nationwide.

They didn't have it at the time. When we did the temporary site, we used urban sites, a special study done for three urban sites, two in Philadelphia and one in Pittsburgh.

[Speaker 5] (1:46:03 - 1:47:14)
Okay. Well, one would argue Philadelphia and Pittsburgh are nothing like Chicago density wise, population wise, landmass wise. Anyway, I'll move on from that.

My point is neither Alderman Burnett nor myself have had the opportunity to review this study that was delivered to us yesterday morning, about 24 hours ago. And that's very frustrating to me because it's a recent development and it will impact Illinois gaming board approval, which we should all care about in this chamber. I read recently about a transaction with Oak street real estate capital, a $500 million transaction.

But I haven't received a whole lot of information in this building about that deal. So for the record, I just want to make sure I understand it. Oak street purchased the 30 acre site for $200 million in a sale lease back deal with Bally's.

And according to the news reports, I read the land was sold for 200 million and then Oak street will provide $300 million to fund the development with a 99 year ground lease. Do I have those facts correct? Chris.

[Speaker 13] (1:47:18 - 1:47:25)
Chris Jewett with Bally's. So to, I guess to summarize most, mostly accurate Alderman Riley.

[Speaker 3] (1:47:25 - 1:48:22)
So Bally's assigned the right to purchase the land. We had a purchase option from Nexstar Realty. So we assigned the right with the agreement that we would enter into a 99 year ground lease with 10, 20 year extensions with a buyback option in order to lease the land from Oak street real estate capital.

They essentially stepped into our shoes, paid the 200 million to buy the land and simultaneously executed that ground lease. As such there's optionality for Bally's to draw up to $300 million more from Oak street over time during the construction of the project. We view this as a positive for the project.

It's capital that is at about a 7% rate. When you look at today's construction financing market with rates on the rise hopefully settling here soon, construction financing is somewhere between 10 and 12% at a minimum.

[Speaker 5] (1:48:24 - 1:48:34)
And okay. Appreciate you answering that. So is that $300 million that can be accessed?

Is that, is that a loan? Is it equity or, or, or is it something else?

[Speaker 3] (1:48:35 - 1:48:41)
It would be treated as future rent payments. So at a 7% cap rate.

[Speaker 5] (1:48:43 - 1:49:05)
And so again you know, God forbid if Bally's were to default, would Oak street take control over this casino? Yes, they would. Okay.

And finally on this line of questioning, is Oak street putting in more capital at 500 million than Bally's is?

[Speaker 3] (1:49:06 - 1:49:17)
No, if, if you recall, the project is a $1.7 billion project. They are capped out at 500. Resulting would be us coming in with 1.2, 1.2. Okay.

[Speaker 5] (1:49:18 - 1:49:47)
And then we do have our, our partners in organized labor here today. And I know that the labor unions are very excited about this project. There's a lot of opportunity in it for them and I'm excited for them as well, even though I oppose this project.

I know that you have a labor peace agreement in place, which is a very good thing. But you're also going to have to execute individual contracts with your union partners, correct?

[Speaker 13] (1:49:55 - 1:49:59)
This is Joy and Vakil with Bally's. That is correct. All the minority.

[Speaker 5] (1:49:59 - 1:50:01)
Okay. And where do those negotiations stand today?

[Speaker 20] (1:50:02 - 1:50:12)
We are in very early stages right now. The only agreements or only discussions that have been transpiring have been on the temporary casino so far.

[Speaker 5] (1:50:13 - 1:50:42)
Okay. And the reason I ask is that Alderman Burnett and Alderman Beale and others have been asking questions about minority participation. And I think you have a very laudable goal of reaching 60% participation.

I think that's fantastic. But you also have made some very firm commitments to organized labor. And so I'm just trying to understand how you're going to thread that needle and satisfy both constituencies.

[Speaker 20] (1:50:45 - 1:50:55)
This is Joy and Vakil with Bally's again. We are absolutely working on all potential opportunities in order to satisfy all the commitments that we've made.

[Speaker 5] (1:50:57 - 1:53:55)
Okay. Well, I'm not going to harp on that anymore. I know that members of the council expect that you'll execute excellent agreements with your union partners.

And I know that'll be a process, but I also hope you achieve your minority hiring goals. Chairman, just in closing for my remarks, I want to reiterate that I'm very much opposed to the permanent and temporary casino sites. And most of it has to do with the process that we went through here.

It seems like a million years ago when the mayor appointed her internal evaluation committee to vet multiple bids for our casino, and then narrowed it down to five finalists. Then impaneled a committee here at city council that you chaired, Chairman Tunney, the casino committee. And when that was created, we were told that the committee was charged with reviewing the three finalists, vetting them, and making a recommendation.

We had two meetings, which you led. They were not very long ones. And then the mayor short circuited the process by selecting a finalist without input from our committee.

The city approved the Bally's temporary and permanent casinos shortly thereafter, despite the fact we didn't have final traffic studies or public safety plans in place. And in fact, I know it's a complicated thing to work through, but we still don't have final public safety plan for either the temporary or the permanent casino sites. And I've said this before, it seems like we're building the plane as we're flying it.

And I can tell you public safety is front of mind for every Chicagoan. And there is, I think, a valid concern that we need to have a rock solid plan in place to mitigate those potential threats. And we're taking a great leap of faith here by doing this last piece and approving the zoning, which then sets the casino free to go see the state regulators at the gaming board.

But we're doing that without having done, I think, the due diligence on safety and really honestly going through the traffic analysis. When I went through the temporary site traffic study, I found all sorts of flaws. And some, not the traffic consultant's fault at all.

There's just certain things you can't measure accurately, like ride share trips and charter buses. So again, I wish this process had gone differently. I wish it had been more transparent and more inclusive of the folks that are impacted by these sites.

I respect my colleagues who plan to vote yes. It is an incredible economic opportunity for the city. And we want this to create good paying jobs.

I just wish this had gone differently. And I'll be voting no today and will encourage my colleagues to do the same. Thank you, Alderman Hopkins.

[Speaker 16] (1:53:58 - 1:56:28)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I want to acknowledge you prefaced the framework for this debate by asking us to focus on the specific changes to the PD. This is the zoning committee after all.

And I appreciate that. So I do want to acknowledge some incremental improvement in the plan going forward. Some hard work has been done, some community input has been accepted, some has been ignored.

That's the nature of that process. But there have been some incremental improvements made and I feel it is appropriate to acknowledge them. However, whether or not there's going to be a concert hall as part of this and some of the other questions that we're talking about today, really pale in comparison to the larger question that I do think we have to focus on.

We're going into business with this company, the city of Chicago through its corporate entity and those of us representing it today are contemplating a potential business partnership with Bally's Corporation. And the concerns that have been raised recently, in my opinion, are not getting anywhere near enough attention. We're going into business with an entity that has $3.4 billion in debt and the capital markets are looking askance at that right now. And I just want to highlight something that came up in the most recent corporate earnings call. This was just from last month where one of the analysts in talking about that debt and how it would impact Bally's ability to move forward with this very expensive project asks Representative Bally's, and I'll read from the transcript here, if you could comment on how much more equity you would be willing to put to make this project a bit more feasible given the current capital markets to which the CFO of Bally's responds, well, we're close and we're focused on a land sale and lease back to the city of Chicago. That's a core part of the capital structure.

Ladies and gentlemen, that's like taking out a home equity loan on a house you haven't even built yet and has no equity. This is not a healthy partner that we should be considering here. There's some real questions about their economic viability and it casts a shadow over this whole process right now.

So whether or not there's going to be a concert hall, how much traffic and how big the parking garage is going to be there is and should be secondary to these larger concerns about the financial viability of this arrangement that we're contemplating here. We're making a mistake. We are making a mistake and the signs are clear.

The lights are changing from yellow to red. It's time to tap the brakes on this. I will be voting no today.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:56:29 - 1:56:47)
Thank you, Alderman Hopkins. Would anyone from the team like to respond? I know that's not a zoning issue, but it is certainly an issue.

Well, I'll ask Jenny for a second, but let's start with Bally's and then we'll go to our CFO.

[Speaker 3] (1:56:48 - 1:57:27)
Chris Jewitt with Bally's. Thank you for the comments, Alderman Hopkins. So in regards to your concerns here, I think a few things.

One, the sale-leaseback transaction, it's quite typical in the gaming and casino space. Roughly 40 to 50%, I don't know the exact number of properties throughout the country, but 40 to 50% of the properties, gaming casino properties in the country are actually under a sale-leaseback relationship or transaction with a REIT. There's actually two very prominent REITs in the gaming space and then a handful that do more regional type assets.

[Speaker 1] (1:57:28 - 1:57:30)
So that's a great- Point of clarification, is Oak Street one of those?

[Speaker 3] (1:57:30 - 1:57:33)
Oak Street is the third largest in the area, I believe.

[Speaker 1] (1:57:34 - 1:57:35)
Okay, I just wanted to make that connection.

[Speaker 3] (1:57:36 - 1:59:10)
Additionally, relative to our financial situation, I think that picture has not been painted very well or at least not as accurate as it could be. All public companies don't carry a lot of cash on their balance sheet. It's expensive for us to keep cash on our balance sheet if we have outstanding debt.

So most excess cash is used to pay down debts. You're not paying 6%, 7%, 8% interest on an ongoing basis when you just have money in the bank earning 1% or 2% interest. That's generally the economics there.

I think relative to your point that we're not liquid or from what I've heard, I think that's an inaccurate statement. So a few items to note. One, we have a $620 million revolver.

You can see that if you go through our financial statements, which are filed on a quarterly basis with the SEC. As of last month, we had more than $500 million of that available as of that date, so September 30th. Additionally, we have a previously announced sale-leaseback transaction to sell the real estate to Gaming Leisure Properties for one of our assets in Rhode Island and one in Mississippi, which would give us proceeds of $635 million.

And then the transaction with Oak Street Real Estate Capital, which could be upwards of $500 million. If you total all of those available capital streams, excluding free cash flow over the next four years, because this project will be built over four years, and excluding free cash flow from the temporary casino, that will give us $1.7 billion to finance it.

[Speaker 1] (1:59:11 - 1:59:14)
All right. Our CFO, Jenny Bennett, please.

[Speaker 19] (1:59:14 - 2:00:11)
Thank you, Chairman. Just to reiterate some of Chris's comments, Bally's does have cash. And very importantly, as a part of the evaluation that we did in the evaluation process, we conducted a review, which was supported by external analysis, which took a look at the financial wherewithal of all of the bidders that provided bids during the process.

So there was an extensive review around that. In addition, sale-leasebacks are very common in the casino industry by way of financing casino projects. It's a financing mechanism.

And I think Chris spoke to the interest rates and ultimately the benefit to the project of the sale-leaseback process. There are a number of casinos in the state of Illinois that are using a sale-leaseback process in the building of their casinos. And then also, again, just to reiterate Chris's comment about Oak Street, they are a highly qualified partner here in terms of sale-leasebacks in the market as well.

[Speaker 34] (2:00:14 - 2:00:14)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:00:16 - 2:00:24)
I think we know Oak Street is Chicago. I'm going to ask a round two for Gil.

[Speaker 10] (2:00:27 - 2:00:41)
Point of clarification? Well, no, no, I'll strike that. It is a round two.

It's just given the concerns that my colleague from the second ward mentioned, do we have a performance bond in place in case there is any issues that come up that ultimately a project will be completed?

[Speaker 19] (2:00:41 - 2:00:58)
So we have liquidated damages negotiated as part of this project, which again is a term that I would say is very advantageous to the city. It ensures the performance and ultimately the significant revenues that we expect from this ensures the performance of that as we move through this project.

[Speaker 10] (2:00:58 - 2:00:59)
Was there a performance bond put up?

[Speaker 19] (2:01:00 - 2:01:05)
I believe for construction. I'll have to check with Sid. You can probably speak to that.

[Speaker 1] (2:01:06 - 2:01:08)
Chris, do you want to answer that question?

[Speaker 13] (2:01:11 - 2:01:12)
Okay. Yes, we do.

[Speaker 1] (2:01:14 - 2:01:15)
Okay. Alderman Waguespack.

[Speaker 13] (2:01:18 - 2:01:20)
Hear what Chris had said in that last statement.

[Speaker 1] (2:01:20 - 2:01:24)
Okay. Would you repeat the statement about the performance bond?

[Speaker 3] (2:01:24 - 2:01:29)
Oh, no. My last comment was that Oak Street was a local city of Chicago business.

[Speaker 1] (2:01:29 - 2:01:32)
Oak Street Capital. All right. Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 13] (2:01:35 - 2:01:38)
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee.

[Speaker 4] (2:01:39 - 2:08:26)
You all know I was really big on promoting this casino because it's important for the city of Chicago. We've already got $40 million from them to balance our budget. We pretty much are partners in this casino on getting about $200 million a year, if I'm not mistaken, to help us with our pension obligations in the future to try to make the city solvent as we go on.

As far as the zoning goes, the proposed zoning that was here before, the plan development that was here before had more units, more people, a lot of other things. This new development has less space, square footage of buildings and what have you, although we do have a casino. This development has also worked with the community.

We have an advisory council. They took a lot of things that the community had said that they were for and against, including the things from my very articulate colleagues, Alderman Rowley and Alderman Hopkins. They incorporated some of those things.

They took out a bridge that was going to go over Erie. They took out outdoor entertainment. They also put parking underground.

They also have roadways going underground to help alleviate traffic. There's a lot of infrastructure work that's going to be done with this. There's going to be a lot of construction jobs.

In reference to just the infrastructure work, there's a lot of construction jobs. Then there's going to be a lot of construction jobs with the casino, but potential other construction jobs in the future with the other developments, whether Valley keep them or sell them off or whatever the case may be. This plan development was a broad plan development that we had put in place, working with the neighbors of River West, who was the organization that was interested in these things at that time.

We did a lot of due diligence on the traffic study at that time, working with the same traffic engineer that Valley's hired. He worked on the other plan development that was proposed here. He worked with the community.

The community is very satisfied with it. He's incorporated a lot of those things in this development. As I said, hopefully, it shouldn't be as many people as it was before.

The difference with this is now they have bike lanes, a dog park, a lot of amenities that the community could have in this River West area. We are very lacking on green space. We don't have a lot of public space and Valley's first thing we talked about was green space in this area.

Valley's looked to hire a lot of security on the job. They're working in coordination with the police department. There's a lot of things going on about security.

The city have an investment in this, so we're concerned about security too because we want people to feel safe and want them to be able to come. Another thing that's important for security is that we employ people from, I say Cabrini Green, but really I mean the near north area, that we employ folks from that community so that they can be working and they won't have time to do anything else. We need to bring the community up with all the other things that's coming in the neighborhood.

This is an opportunity to do so. I'm not just talking about them being doormen and valet parking and all that stuff, but we want them to have those construction jobs that pay $30 and $40 and $50 and $60 an hour on this site. One of the things that was committed to me early on and one of the main reasons why I supported this was that the jobs was going to come to our community.

When I talk about our community, I know the predominant folks in our community are African American, but I represent a very diverse community. This area has always been diverse, and there's a lot of people that need jobs in our community, whether they're black, white, Latino, Asian, whatever the case may be. Our folks deserve these jobs on the construction, but also the jobs inside of Valleys, and we want to make sure that they get them.

Valleys has given me a commitment. I've seen several documents. The administration has given me a commitment.

One of the unique things about this business and being here for almost 28 years now is that everybody got to come back and see you. Eventually, they're going to need something else. I'm sure that if they don't want to see me upset in the future, that they're going to keep their commitment.

We're hiring people in our neighborhood. I feel confident that this is going to be okay. Of course, with the city being partners in this and getting the assurance from the city end of it too, I think we're going to be okay, but we want to make sure that everyone come up in this neighborhood, no one is left behind, and that we continue to work with the community to make this thing as livable as possible and not disturb any other people in the community, but bring the neighborhood up.

There's a lot of things happening in this neighborhood, and we're very proud of it. This area, when I was a little kid, we used to play in this area, and we called it ghost town, but this area now is going to be one of the most vibrant communities in the city of Chicago, and we're very, very proud of it. I support this thing 100%.

We're going to make sure that our people get work and get jobs, and also we're going to work on making sure that they're prepared to work and prepared to get the jobs, not only on this part, but also in the temporary part, if that's okay with Alderman Rowley and his ward.

[Speaker 1] (2:08:27 - 2:09:10)
Thank you. Thank you, Alderman Burnett. Any questions?

Comments? If not, Alderman Mike Rodriguez makes a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was determined. Hold on a second.

Let me finish. The motion was put by Rodriguez. There's a request for a roll call, so we'll do a roll call.

All right. Just so we have it on the record. All right.

Obviously, yes is to support the ordinance in the Valley Casino, and no is to not support it at this time. All right. Vice-Chair Roboyas, Alderman Hopkins, Alderman

[Speaker 13] (2:09:10 - 2:09:21)
Dowell, Alderman Sawyer, Alderman Beal, Alderman Ray Lopez, Alderman David Moore,

[Speaker 1] (2:09:23 - 2:09:33)
Alderman Mike Rodriguez, Alderman Siccio Lopez, Alderman Burnett, Alderman Cardona,

[Speaker 13] (2:09:35 - 2:09:44)
Alderman Wagesbeck, Alderwoman Austin is not here, Alderman Villegas, Alderman Riley,

[Speaker 1] (2:09:45 - 2:10:40)
Alderman Kappelman, Alderman Osterman is not here, Alderwoman Haddon, aye, and Chairman Toney is an aye. That's our total.

Total is 10 to four, so this item will pass as recommended to the full council tomorrow. Thank you. Good luck.

As Alderman Burnett and Riley and Hopkins, you haven't seen the last of involvement with the local aldermans, and all of us too, because it's a citywide project. We started this, you know, people talk about 28 years ago. I think there was talk about a casino 28 years ago.

So obviously a lot of devils, the devil's in the details, but you know, we wish you good luck and success financial and also community success and city success. So congratulations. All right.

[Speaker 13] (2:10:42 - 2:10:48)
We're gonna keep moving because we're a little bit late. All right.

[Speaker 23] (2:10:49 - 2:10:51)
Come back to the minor leagues.

[Speaker 1] (2:10:52 - 2:10:53)
Oh, you're, oh, you're heading up here.

[Speaker 23] (2:10:53 - 2:10:54)
Yeah.

[Speaker 1] (2:10:54 - 2:11:04)
All right. All right. We are on page two in the 44th ward and I yield the chair to my vice chair, Alderman Roboyes.

[Speaker 13] (2:11:05 - 2:11:20)
All right, moving along here. Next item on the agenda is number 22024T1.

[Speaker 23] (2:11:21 - 2:11:44)
The 44th ward ordinance was referred on 11-16-2022. Common address is 2943 North Halsted Street. The change request is an RM 4.5 residential multi-unit district to an RM 5 residential multi-unit district. Tyler Manick.

[Speaker 36] (2:11:45 - 2:12:54)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Tyler Manick. I'm here on behalf of the owner of 2943 North Halsted, 19 Wabash 1, which is seeking a type one zoning map amendment for 2943 North Halsted.

2943 North Halsted is currently zoned RM 4.5 and it is currently improved with a three and a half story masonry building containing three dwelling units. The first floor is currently a duplex unit spanning the first and garden levels. The applicant seeks a type one zoning map amendment to rezone 2943 North Halsted to an RM 5 in order to convert the garden level into a new dwelling unit.

After rezoning, the massing of the building will remain the same. There will be four dwelling units and three parking spaces. The owner will also accomplish some deferred maintenance such as tuck pointing, which will be undertaken to restore the building's exterior.

Prior to the filing, the applicant reached out to the adjacent neighbors and met with Southeast Lakeview neighbors who unanimously approved this project. And I believe Chairman Tunney is available to confirm his support.

[Speaker 1] (2:12:56 - 2:13:05)
Alderman Tunney. All right, I'm going to defer to my chief of staff, Mr. Lawson, since he'll probably get some more experience in the future years. So Bennett, do you want to say a few words?

[Speaker 31] (2:13:06 - 2:13:30)
Chief of staff Bennett. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. I'm Bennett Lawson, chief of staff to Alderman Tunney in the 44th ward.

This location is actually right across the street from the ADU inclusionary area and is a perfect example of that gentle density, adding a unit to the basement. So there have been no issues with any of the neighbors and the community group is in full support and we ask the committee's support.

[Speaker 13] (2:13:30 - 2:13:42)
Thank you. Thank you, sir. Are there any questions by committee members?

Hearing none, move to pass by Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 23] (2:13:43 - 2:14:23)
Motion do pass by Alderman Lopez, used to determine quorum. Are there any objections? Hearing none, this item is passed.

All right, moving along in the minor leagues here. In the 44th ward, item number 22025-T1, an ordinance referred on November 16, 2022. Common address 3710 North Kenmore Avenue.

The change request is an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to B2-3 neighborhood mixed-use district. Here to speak on the matter is Mr. Scott. Andrew Scott, you may go ahead.

[Speaker 30] (2:14:24 - 2:15:29)
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. For the record, my name is Andrew Scott with the law offices of Dykema Gossett and I'm here on behalf of 3710 N. Kenmore, LLC.

As you did mention, the proposal is to rezone the property from RT4 to a B2-3. This would be a type one. It's a rather unusual property.

It's 40 feet by 50 feet and it's currently improved with a fairly dilapidated single family home. Over the course of the past several months, we have had extensive discussions with immediate neighbors. We've met with a community group, East Lakeview neighbors twice, and also had discussions with the Alderman's office.

There have been substantial changes over the past several months to the project. There's been a reduction in height and FAR. We've eliminated the roof duck.

We've reduced the number of bedrooms to address concerns about densities that were raised by the neighbors. We've redesigned the materials and the facade of the building and then we've also made a commitment to the community of no short-term rental. So a lot of work with the community and with the Alderman's office to get us where we are today and we would appreciate your favorable consideration.

[Speaker 23] (2:15:31 - 2:15:32)
Thank you.

[Speaker 31] (2:15:32 - 2:15:39)
Alderman Tony, I'll yield again to my Chief of Staff on this item. Chief of Staff Bennett. Thank you Alderman.

[Speaker 23] (2:15:39 - 2:15:40)
Please identify yourself.

[Speaker 31] (2:15:40 - 2:16:12)
Thank you. Vice Chair Borges, it's Bennett Lawson, Chief of Staff in the 44th Ward. This is a very unusual property indeed.

It's actually in the Wrigley Rooftop District but behind another rooftop building. I garnered some headlines for a list price a few years ago so you may know it but I would say the applicants have been very workable with both the immediate neighbors and then the neighborhood group along with our office in making large reductions in the number of bedrooms, the number of units, and the height. This does have the support of Eastlake View Neighbors and we would ask the committee's full support as well.

Thank you.

[Speaker 23] (2:16:13 - 2:16:23)
Thank you Chief of Staff Bennett. Are there any questions? Alderman Wagesbeck moves to pass.

Oh questions by Alderman Beal.

[Speaker 9] (2:16:24 - 2:16:39)
Minor League Vice Chairman, I just want to let the Chief of Staff know that he sounds so much better than his boss and that you know he articulates the issues a lot more and I you know I want to commend him for his leadership.

[Speaker 13] (2:16:40 - 2:16:42)
Wait till the next one. Point taken.

[Speaker 23] (2:16:42 - 2:16:42)
Thank you.

[Speaker 13] (2:16:43 - 2:16:44)
Wait till the next one.

[Speaker 1] (2:16:44 - 2:16:51)
Okay. All right I think we're the ninth ward will be at the end of our agenda.

[Speaker 23] (2:16:54 - 2:17:32)
Wagesbeck moves to pass by the same roll call. Use the determined quorum. All in favor?

All opposed? Hearing none, this item is passed. Thank you very much.

Thank you sir. We have, wait a minute, yeah one more here. Item number 22021-T1 in the 44th ward ordinance referred on November 16, 2020 to common address 1040-1042 West Waveland Avenue.

Change request is an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to B2-3 neighborhood mixed-use district. Council?

[Speaker 18] (2:17:33 - 2:18:08)
Good afternoon Chairman. For the record, Nick Fatikas from the Law Offices of Sam Banks. I'm here on behalf of the contract purchaser 1040 Waveland LLC.

Again, they're proposing to redevelop the subject property at 1040 through 42 West Waveland with a new five-story nine-unit residential, excuse me, residential building. We are seeking a zoning change to the B2-3 zoning district to take advantage of the transit oriented development ordinance for the project. We have worked at length with the 44th ward as well as with the South East Lakeview neighbors, or South Lakeview neighbors, I'm sorry.

[Speaker 1] (2:18:09 - 2:18:10)
East Lakeview neighbors.

[Speaker 18] (2:18:11 - 2:18:50)
It was Slevin. East, I'm sorry, I confused the two on my script. And at this point, I believe we have their support based on a restrictive covenant that there would be no commercial uses proposed at the property.

Although this property is on Waveland directly across the street from Wrigley Field, our program does not contemplate permanent seating on the roof. And we also have agreed to security measures to ensure that during all game days and events, the building is kept secure for the residents. Based on that, again, we believe we have support to move forward, but I'll defer either to the alderman or Mr. Lawson for further comment.

[Speaker 1] (2:18:52 - 2:18:54)
You can start Ben.

[Speaker 23] (2:18:54 - 2:18:56)
Chief of Staff Bennett, would you like to speak on the matter?

[Speaker 31] (2:18:56 - 2:19:44)
Yes, thank you. Thank you again. 44th ward Alderman and Chief of Staff Bennett Lawson here.

We've been working on this project for probably a year. The original concept was very different from where we started and was a different kind of rooftop project. I think working with the community and their neighbors, the biggest ones, of course, to the south, we arrived at what is a residential building that doesn't have commercial uses, that doesn't include short term rentals, that doesn't have fixed seating or a liquor license.

So I think, you know, there were a lot of modifications made based on the neighbors, the decks were pulled in so that they're smaller, the height was reduced. And there were additional modifications that we've worked on with setbacks and security and garbage. So there's some mixed feelings in the area about it.

But it's a good fit, we think for that block and the area.

[Speaker 1] (2:19:44 - 2:20:38)
They're pretty good. Yeah. Oh, train them well.

Well, I do want to add, though, that this has some object object doors. And specifically, I don't think the Cubs are enamored by this. That being said, this is investment in the rooftop district that will not allow for any rooftop or commercial activity in there.

So we have to keep moving investment. You know, I think the Cubs thought they were going to add that to their portfolio, they did not compete with this particular group. And yet we still need need to move development, investment, and the protections with the restrictive covenant, I think is fair.

For investment, it's fair for the Cubs. And I think I think we're also reverting this owning back to our our board.

[Speaker 18] (2:20:38 - 2:20:55)
So so assuming all of our building permits and occupancy approvals issue, part of the restrictive covenant that we've negotiated with your offices to rezone the property back to our four, which would keep it consistent are for zoning on the north side of Waveland.

[Speaker 1] (2:20:56 - 2:21:31)
And while it's a four story building, or ours is five, yes, we don't have any, obviously scalable. No, no, that's sitting on top of it. So it's gonna look actually pretty, pretty in scale with the rest, which was another concern that some of the community members had.

So, you know, we did a lot of work thanks to the to your team and to our office. And as we say, not everyone's 100% happy, but I think it's progress. So I urge a yay vote from my committee members.

Questions, Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 7] (2:21:32 - 2:21:43)
Thank you, Chairman. I just want to ask if the chief of staff concurs with the Alderman's assessment. I do.

Yes, thank you. Then move to pass, Chairman.

[Speaker 23] (2:21:43 - 2:21:54)
All right. There are no questions. I know we've had a rough meeting today, but the same roll call used to determine quorum all in favor or opposed this item has passed.

[Speaker 20] (2:21:54 - 2:21:54)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:21:55 - 2:22:34)

We have met with alderman mitts and I have submitted a letter of support from alderman mitts to staff at your office.

He is also one of the owners along with three other members of his family. We're requesting today a zoning change from an rs3 residential single unit detached housing district to that of an RM 4.5. The purpose of the zoning changes will allow the construction of a full fourth addition to legalize the conversion from three to four dwelling units within the existing three-story residential building. We have gone through the zoning requirements for Alderman Rodriguez Sanchez.

We're here today requesting the zoning change from the current rs3 residential single unit detached housing district to an rt4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district. The purpose of the zoning change is to allow the construction of a two-story four dwelling unit residential building with an on-site four-car parking garage. We've had a number of meetings through Alderman Rebois' request.

This project started out as a six-unit request. We have agreed to the four dwelling units. We believe there is a letter of support from the alderman and I believe he's here without the need of his staff to make his presentation.

[Speaker 1] (2:26:36 - 2:26:46)
Okay. Thank you, Paul. That is your last application today, right?

All right. Let's hear from Vice Chair Rebois on the item on Costner.

[Speaker 23] (2:26:46 - 2:26:54)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We've gone through a community process on this and we're good to go with this and I ask for your favorable support no matter before you.

[Speaker 1] (2:26:55 - 2:27:08)
Questions, comments for the alderman or the applicant? Hearing none, Alderman Kaplan moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that?

Hearing none, the item is passed. All right.

[Speaker 28] (2:27:08 - 2:27:09)
Thank you all. Be healthy. Be safe.

Middle of page four, document number 22026, T1, 33rd Ward. Ordinance was referred November 16th of 2022 and the common address is 3219 North Elston Avenue and the change request from C11, Neighborhood Commercial District to B23, Neighborhood Mixed Use District.

[Speaker 39] (2:27:31 - 2:28:25)
Afternoon, Mr. Chairman. Dan Lauer for the owner and applicant. 3219 North Elston, 22026 Type 1, Carolina Bach, BAK of 46 Beacon is the applicant.

She's also the owner of this 25 by 120 site. She demolished a very, very decrepit building that was lost in foreclosure. The proposal is C11 to B23 to construct a mixed use building, four dwelling units, one retail, three off-street parking.

We can dispense with one parking because it's 290 feet from the Belmont bus line and we had several community meetings. The last of which Alderman Rodriguez-Sanchez required was to 750 foot radius. We're happy to have the support of Avondale neighbors and a letter of support from the Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (2:28:25 - 2:29:18)
We have received a letter of support from Alderman Rodriguez-Sanchez. Any questions for Dan? Hearing none, Alderman Roboya's moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, this item is passed. All right, bottom of page four, document number 22019, 32nd Ward.

Ordinance was referred on November 26th of 2022. This common address 2501 North Damon Avenue, also 1880 West Fullerton Avenue and 2417 North Elston. Change request.

Waterway plan development number 1471 to C33 commercial manufacturing and employment district. We have Paul Shadle on this application in the 32nd Ward.

[Speaker 30] (2:29:18 - 2:30:02)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman. Yes, I'm Paul Shadle from the law firm of DLA Piper in Chicago appearing on behalf of the applicant Vienna Beef for a change of zoning from waterway plan development 1471 to the C33 district. The site was designated a waterway plan development in 2020 in order to facilitate a golf and entertainment project.

That project will not proceed and so the applicant is before you today to request that you effectuate the sunset provision of statement 17 of the plan development to revert the zoning to the C33 district. We, I believe Alderman Wagaspak did submit a letter of no objection and we would respectfully request your positive recommendation.

[Speaker 1] (2:30:03 - 2:30:06)
Thank you, Paul. Alderman Wagaspak.

[Speaker 20] (2:30:06 - 2:30:33)
Thanks, Chairman. Paul is correct. I think in the plan that we had in 2020 that the zoning committee helped us put through was unable to move forward due to a lot of the downturn of the economy and some of the finances during COVID.

So they were not able to move forward on it and this would just bring us back to a position where we could reuse the property.

[Speaker 13] (2:30:36 - 2:30:38)
And so I would ask for the committee's favorable consideration of the item.

[Speaker 1] (2:30:40 - 2:31:19)
Thank you, Scott. Questions? Comments?

Okay, we have just one question. Was this the one they had a bunch of hype? They were going to do a golf?

Yeah, it was the people were worried about the noise or lights. Well, it was a golf drive type place. Okay, but that's been at least in the thoughts for what two or three years, three years, I think.

Yeah. All right, we'll start over. All right.

Questions? Comments? Hearing none, Alderman Cardona, moves to pass by the same roll call that was used in the term form.

Any objections? I think Alderwoman Haddon wanted to be recorded.

[Speaker 24] (2:31:23 - 2:31:30)
I don't even golf and I was really looking forward to this. So I need you guys, I object on the grounds that you should make this happen, right?

[Speaker 1] (2:31:31 - 2:32:04)
All right. Well, duly noted. We'll just leave it at that.

All right. Thank you. This item is passed.

All right. Let me see. We're on top page five.

And that is document number 2201526 Ford ordinance was referred on November 16th of 2022 common address 1401 North Avers Avenue and the change request from an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RT4 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district. We have Mr. Moore, Tom Moore on this.

[Speaker 15] (2:32:05 - 2:32:54)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name for the record is Tom Moore and this is in the 26th ward. It's a rare vacant lot.

Anna DeLuna and her husband Rogelio have been long-term residents of the ward and they want to build a multi-family four unit house or building a two-story four dwelling residential building to with their daughter, Laura, and they may have some outside renters to help them with the mortgage, et cetera. And we're aware of no opposition to this. And we have a letter of support from Alderman Maldonado and we'd request your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (2:32:55 - 2:33:10)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Maldonado. Questions, comments? Hearing none.

Middle of page five, document number 22022, T1 in the 25th ward ordinance was referred on November 16th of 2022. Common address is 225 West Alexander Street. Change request from an RT4 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district to a B23 neighborhood mixed use district.

And we have Fred Augustin. Hi, Fred.

[Speaker 37] (2:33:46 - 2:34:54)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee for the record, Fred Augustin. I'm an attorney on with law offices of Augustin and Associates LLC. I'm here on behalf of the applicant, Sally May.

The applicant owns the property at 225 West Alexander Street. It's currently improved with a one story single family residence. The applicant is seeking to rezone the property from an RT4 district to a B23 neighborhood mixed use district, which is a type one application.

The plan is to demolish the existing single family residence. The reason for this change is to allow the redevelopment of the property for a new three story, three unit building. Since the property is a very short lot, the building will not have onsite parking serving the units.

However, it is located in a transit served location since it's approximately 850 feet from the Cermak Chinatown red line station. So the applicant has worked with Alderman Byron Siccio Lopez's office as well as the Zoning Advisory Board on this project. And I believe the Alderman is in support.

I believe you should have a letter of support on file as well. And I believe the Alderman is here.

[Speaker 1] (2:34:54 - 2:35:00)
Alderman Siccio Lopez is with us. Byron, would you like to comment on this item in 25?

[Speaker 35] (2:35:00 - 2:35:19)
Thank you, Chairman. Yes, as applicants have said, the applicant met with the Zoning Advisory Board and went above and beyond to address concerns of especially some neighbors around parking and other concerns. But I was able to satisfactorily, I was satisfactorily approved by the Zoning Advisory Board.

So we asking our colleagues for a favorable vote on this item.

[Speaker 1] (2:35:20 - 2:35:32)
Any questions for the Alderman or the applicant? Hearing none, Alderman Kaplan moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, this item is passed.

[Speaker 37] (2:35:32 - 2:35:33)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:35:33 - 2:36:11)

Questions from start with all the woman had.

[Speaker 24] (2:37:10 - 2:37:21)
Do we have any. Hi. Hello.

And I asked Metro to weigh in on the value and construction.

[Speaker 18] (2:37:55 - 2:38:07)
We're looking at identify yourself. Oh, my name is Greg Christian. I am representative for Metro.

Right now we're looking at a construction cost of about $68 million.

[Speaker 1] (2:38:10 - 2:38:18)
Putting a lot of investment on the south side. Yes, we are for that now we just want the ridership to keep moving in the right direction. Also, yes.

[Speaker 24] (2:38:19 - 2:38:51)
All the woman had just knowing that metros and kind of early stages of doing some planning for the Rogers Park Pacific North line station renovations, I would be really curious to actually see the plan so just unrelated to decisions on this item I would love to see if Metro could send to the 49th ward office, some of the work that you guys are doing on this station just to get an idea of some of the scope that's possible.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:39:24 - 2:39:54)
Thank you. Top of page six document number 21177 in the 42nd Ward ordinance was referred on October 26 of 2022. This common address is 201 through 221 East Erie 631 through 649 North St. Clair Street, 200 to 212 East Ontario. The comment, let's see the change request plan development number 468 as amended to plan development number 468 as amended again, Carol.

[Speaker 12] (2:39:55 - 2:40:26)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee Carol still feel with me on the right office is located at 20 South Clark here on behalf of the African Northwestern Memorial Healthcare with me today are members from a Northwestern development team and are including our project architects from Gensler Architects. Mr. Chairman, this matter was heard and unanimously approved yesterday at the Chicago Plan Commission we asked that the findings documents plans drawings and conclusions of the Chicago Plan Commission, and the documents given to the Department of Planning and Development be adopted into today's record.

[Speaker 1] (2:40:26 - 2:40:37)
Alderman Wagesbeck moves to incorporate the records from the Plan Commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the plans are in front of us.

[Speaker 12] (2:40:37 - 2:41:51)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, as you mentioned, this is a technical amendment. There's no change to the footprint height or elevations, except for the pedestrian bridge at East Erie of the existing development, this is a technical amendment to add medical service to the existing PD to repurpose two floors from hotel to medical service. And so, like I said, there's not going to be any change to the footprint of the building or any changes to traffic flow patterns, increase in volume of existing traffic from the original plan development.

Northwestern will meet the goals of cities goals for sustainable development equitable and city residency hiring goals. The application has complied with all notice requirements and has obtained the necessary approvals from the Department of Transportation fire mayor's office for people with disabilities, and the proposed uses and this amendment application has the full support of the community and Alderman Riley, we'd be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (2:41:53 - 2:42:20)
Obviously, this did plan, this, this did pass plan commission, it did, and it's relatively technical. Correct. No, it was literally the building was is is a hotel the highest hotel.

Okay, correct. So just I wasn't that clued in because I was doing a bunch of meetings yesterday but so you're taking a couple of floors out right which are floors one.

[Speaker 12] (2:42:21 - 2:42:52)
So floors five and six we're reducing each floor has 36 hotel keys. So on floors five and six removing all of those hotel keys and two on floor seven for elevator renovations etc so for a total of 74 keys will be removed and repurposed as medical service so just those two floors plus above and below our hotel rooms. So I'm going to let Charlie or Jeff weigh in on the existing building and what's there.

[Speaker 22] (2:42:54 - 2:43:04)
Jeffrey sod with Gensler architects, the building has the ballroom and some hotel rooms below, and also above, above.

[Speaker 13] (2:43:04 - 2:43:15)
So floor two through 11 is all hotel, so we're only taking five and six. So, or is five and six is the medical.

[Speaker 1] (2:43:15 - 2:43:19)
Yes, that's what we're, that's what we're looking at today. Correct. And did I hear a bridge.

[Speaker 12] (2:43:20 - 2:43:57)
So there's a pedestrian bridge is proposed understanding that that's a separate approval process. They're doing these typically right now is easements. And I think there are additional other bridges in and around the campus the institutional use the medical service campus, and most of those are by easement agreement.

So that'll go to transportation committee and be approved with a minor change to the PD to the north, which is PD three. So there's a minor change to the Galter pavilion so we're connecting to the Galter pavilion across East Erie at the second floor.

[Speaker 1] (2:43:58 - 2:44:06)
Questions, comments or none. Is that a question. All the woman had moves to pass.

[Speaker 24] (2:44:06 - 2:44:07)
Same role.

[Speaker 1] (2:44:07 - 2:44:08)
Is that true.

[Speaker 24] (2:44:08 - 2:44:09)
No, no, it was a question. Oh, I'm sorry.

[Speaker 1] (2:44:09 - 2:44:13)
I couldn't hear you. Say, sorry, I shouldn't from all the woman had.

[Speaker 24] (2:44:13 - 2:44:39)
Yes, thank you chair. I'm wondering if the medical services, kind of being added in these two floors. Is it.

Is it related at all to the hospitality, kind of component, like do you have guests like is it kind of hey people might be staying in the hospitality, kind of component the hotel piece who are also there for medical services just curious if they're related at all healthcare.

[Speaker 22] (2:44:42 - 2:45:03)
We are still determining exactly what those services are going to be. They will be outpatient low acuity and services that would lend themselves well to being co located with a hotel function if that answers your question. And they also the services we're considering already exist on campus they'll just be moving from elsewhere, likely.

[Speaker 1] (2:45:05 - 2:45:21)
And then, just in general, the hotel is right in the middle of the campus. I would venture to say 75% of your occupancy is connected to the hospital use. I don't know the answer to that question.

[Speaker 22] (2:45:23 - 2:45:31)
I do know it's frequent for guests. Patients that have surgeries early in the morning, frequently stay there but I don't know the numbers. Okay.

[Speaker 42] (2:45:32 - 2:45:32)
All right.

[Speaker 22] (2:45:35 - 2:45:49)
Just say, re-identify yourself. I'm sorry. I'm Jeff Saad with Gensler to add upon with the bridge and the uses that the visitors would be staying and they could access a hospital without going outside, which would be a benefit.

[Speaker 1] (2:45:52 - 2:46:04)
Any other questions, comments? If not, Alderman Alderwoman Hadden moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine form. Any objections?

Hearing none, the item is passed.

[Speaker 12] (2:46:04 - 2:46:05)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:46:05 - 2:46:06)
As revised.

[Speaker 12] (2:46:06 - 2:46:07)
Okay. Happy holidays.

[Speaker 1] (2:46:07 - 2:46:11)
Thank you. Let's see, we're on top of page seven, is it?

[Speaker 12] (2:46:11 - 2:46:12)
No, middle page six.

[Speaker 1] (2:46:13 - 2:46:43)
Oh, sorry. Oh, document number 21068 in the 43rd Ward. Ordinance was referred on June 22nd of 2022.

The common address is 2222 North Halstead. And the change request from an RT for residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district to an RM5 residential multi-unit district. All right.

I'm just, I have lots of 22222 everywhere. So I just like it. All right.

Sarah Barnes on this application.

[Speaker 14] (2:46:44 - 2:50:04)
Thank you. Excuse me. Good morning or no afternoon, Mr. Chairman and esteemed members of the committee. For the record, my name is Sarah Barnes and I'm happy to be here this afternoon on behalf of the applicant Dredson Development Company LLC. Here with me as well today from the 43rd Aldermanic Office is Tyler Nessie. We are here today seeking an amendment to the zoning map for this subject property, which is located at 2222 North Halstead Street.

The subject property is currently improved with a three-story width basement building. That was the original construction of which dates back to the early 1800s. The towards that end, the existing building is orange rated on the Chicago historical resources survey, though it is not located in one of the city's landmark districts.

In consideration of the same and as well in light of feedback that the applicant owner has received during a very robust year-long community review of this project, the proposal does call for the preservation and rehabilitation of the existing building, which currently contains three dwelling units that are being rented as apartments. The existing building as it is configured and oriented on the subject site is nonconforming under the current RT4 zoning classification, both in regards to its FAR and its setbacks. The proposal calls for, in addition to the preservation of the facade and sidewalls of the existing building, a small vertical addition above the third floor.

It will be a partial addition, so it will be inset on all four sides. The proposal also calls for internal reconfiguration of the three existing dwelling units to bring them up to current code and standards, and they will be converted from apartments to condominiums. As I stated earlier, in order to effectuate the permitting for this proposal, a zoning map amendment is required, which will also cure the nonconforming conditions.

The zoning change that we are seeking is from the current RT4 to an RM5. Believe it or not, we started this adventure over a year ago, almost two years ago, actually, with Alderman Smith and her office, as well as the Sheffield Neighbors Association. Over the course of the last year, we've had very robust engagement with the members of the local community and the residents of the neighborhood.

In fact, we have collected over 40 letters of support from residents in the neighborhood for the proposal, as well. We've reached out to the two immediately adjacent property owners who have no objection to the proposal. With that, we very respectfully request the support of this committee towards the permitting of this proposal.

I will turn the microphone over to Mr. Nessie, if he'd like to speak as well.

[Speaker 1] (2:50:10 - 2:50:12)
Okay, you're on the right side.

[Speaker 13] (2:50:12 - 2:50:14)
Good afternoon, Chairman and members of the committee.

[Speaker 40] (2:50:14 - 2:51:03)
My name is Taylor Nessie, Director of Zoning and Urban Development under Alderman Timmy Knudson and previously Alderman Michelle Smith. I just want to provide clarification as to process, given there was an automatic change midstream on this. As Ms. Barnes stated, this has been a two-year process. The community review and meeting was held under Alderman Smith's tenure. Alderman Knudson has continued encouraging the applicant to reach out to the neighborhood association and neighbors. The applicant has done so.

We have no opposition to this moving forward, as it does seek to preserve an orange-rated structure, which was the original recommendation of Alderman Smith, as opposed to the originally proposed new construction. We are satisfied with the amendments that the applicant has made in response to community review and recommend that this move to the full council with a yes recommendation.

[Speaker 1] (2:51:04 - 2:51:09)
Thank you. So it took two years.

[Speaker 14] (2:51:10 - 2:51:11)
It did.

[Speaker 1] (2:51:12 - 2:51:14)
And I know we had automatic change.

[Speaker 14] (2:51:15 - 2:51:16)
We did, yes.

[Speaker 1] (2:51:16 - 2:51:24)
So, now that we look at this, I mean, originally it was a teardown and it was an orange-rated, so we can understand the lengthy process.

[Speaker 14] (2:51:25 - 2:51:48)
Yeah, absolutely. And believe it or not, despite it being an orange-rated building, the applicant did apply for a demolition permit early on, again, proposing for new construction and a demolition permit was issued. So it kind of, over time, again, transformed into this preservation project, which we're very proud of.

[Speaker 1] (2:51:49 - 2:51:55)
But it effectuated the zoning upchange, too, which is good. Right. Congratulations.

[Speaker 14] (2:51:56 - 2:51:57)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:51:58 - 2:52:00)
Really close to it. It's very close to the Alderman's office.

[Speaker 40] (2:52:00 - 2:52:04)
I see it every day and I'll be glad to continue seeing it.

[Speaker 1] (2:52:04 - 2:52:20)
All right. Well, hopefully you continue it. All right.

Any questions, comments? All right. Hearing none, Alderman Scott-Wagespec moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to the form.

Any objections to the motion? Hearing none, this item is passed.

[Speaker 13] (2:52:20 - 2:52:21)
Thank you so much.

[Speaker 1] (2:52:21 - 2:52:59)
All right. Thank you. Now, the next item, I'm going to read into the record, but I'm going to ask for a motion to defer.

Per the attorney, this item is number 21119, T1 in the 27th Ward. Ordinance was referred on September 21st of 2022. Common address, 1226 West Augusta Boulevard.

Change request from M33 Heavy Industry District to B23 Neighborhood Mixed Use District. Alderman Wagespec moves, makes a motion to defer this item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. No objections?

Hearing none, this item will be deferred. All right.

[Speaker 13] (2:53:02 - 2:53:04)
All right. Okay. Okay.

Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:53:04 - 2:56:53)
Okay. Well, it makes it go a little quicker. All right.

The next three items, I will read them all in the record at the same time. Is that correct, staff? Correct.

Okay. But it is all one big happy development family. And I'll start on the top of page seven.

Document number 21079 27th Ward Ordinance was referred on July 20th of 2022. This common address is include 501 through 521 West Elm Street 500 through 520 West Hobble Street, 501 through 521 West Hobby Street. Why is it hobby or hobble?

Hobby. Both of them. So 500 to 520 West Hobby Street, 501 through 521 West Hobby Street, 500 through 520 West Oak Street, 1001 through 1135 North Cambridge, and 1000 through 134 North Cleveland.

That is change request plan development number 1006 to DR3 Downtown Residential District. The next item, as I said, we will hear all three together. That being document number 21080 27th Ward Ordinance was referred on July 20th of 2022.

These common addresses 421 through 547 West Division Street, 420 through 546 West Elm Street, 529 through 547 West Elm Street, 528 through 536 West Hobby Street, 529 through 547 West Hobby Street, 528 through 546 West Oak Street, 1000 through 1031 North Larrabee Street, 1111 through 1175 North Larrabee Street, 1000 through 174 North Cambridge Avenue, 1143 through 1175 North Cambridge Avenue, 1142 through 1174 North Cleveland Avenue, 1143 through 1175 North Cleveland Avenue, 1142 through 1174 North Hudson Avenue, and 1143 to 1175 North Hudson Avenue. Again, this change request for is plan development number 1006 through D2 DX3 Downtown Mixed Use District and then plan development number 1006 as amended. Finally, on top of page eight document number 21081 27th Ward Ordinance was referred on July 20th of 2022.

This common address 1101 through 1129 North Cambridge, 500 through 520 West Hobby Street, and 1100 through 1128 North Cleveland Avenue. A change request on this one, DR3 Downtown Residential District to residential plan development. And on all three we have Steve Friedland.

What else are we doing here. Okay, we have Alderman Wagesback moves to incorporate the records from the Planning Commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum on what particular ones for items 21080 and 21081. So, any objections to the motion.

Hearing none, the records are incorporated. And let's make some common sense language of what the heck we're doing here today.

[Speaker 8] (2:56:54 - 2:59:52)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My name is Steve Friedland with Applegate Thorne Thompson. If you move through the slides, there's a slide that shows the entire Parkside development.

That's, that's probably the best slide to work off of so Parkside development is on land owned by the Chicago Housing Authority and it was developed in a joint venture between Holston Real Estate Development Corporation I should say that Peter Holston is here with me right now, and our not for profit partner, the Cabrini Green LAC CDC. This PD was passed in 2006, and since it was passed 694 residential units have been built. The problem is that the development's been a little more successful than people thought in 2006.

And when Peter and his team worked with CHA on the next phase, which is intended to mostly be on what you see there as block six, which is not in yellow. What we realized was that the PD only permitted 782 dwelling units with 694 built to date that only allowed 88 more units but there were still two blocks, block six and block eight that have had no development on them. So, what we have done is propose three zoning actions.

The first is to amend plan development 1006 to remove block six and eight. So they come out of the PD, and what we're left with is a PD 1006 that you see there in yellow. That's action one, and that did go before the plan commission yesterday and you've incorporated into the record those proceedings.

The second action is a straight rezoning action, which is to rezone blocks six and eight to the DR3 classification. That reference there, RT4, is incorrect. The request is for both of those blocks to be downtown residential dash three zoning.

Then the third request, which was also before the plan commission yesterday, is to take a portion of block six. If you're looking there up there at block six, you'll see that at the north end of that block there's like a heavy line and a portion of that block. That's the existing Wayman Church.

Wayman Church will be taken out of the PD. It's a church. It will remain at along Elm Street there.

The third action is a request to develop the remainder of block six with 93 units of new mixed use and mixed income housing.

[Speaker 13] (2:59:53 - 2:59:55)
If you go to the next slide.

[Speaker 8] (2:59:59 - 3:02:42)
So the new project will have a total of 99 new units, which have about 65% of those 99 new units as affordable units or CHA replacement housing. That housing is going on two parts of the map you see. One is that block eight part, and we do have a site plan we can show you in a second, but as long as we're looking at it, it's where the DR3 is noted on that majority of that block eight.

That's going to be 93 units. Then within the existing PD 1006, there is a sub area C, which is shown in yellow, and that's just going to be a six unit walk-up building. They're financed the same together.

They're financed with city of Chicago tax credits, but the only way we could make this work was to have the six units remain in PD 1006, and the 93 units be in a new plan development. If you go to the next slide. Parkside has been basically developed.

There's a number of mid-rise and townhouse and walk-up buildings, which again make up 694 units of housing. If you go to the next slide, and this is looking at the property from the different angle, but basically at Hobby and Cleveland, that block there, that is what I've referred to as block six. It will now have 93 units in three buildings, two walk-up buildings, which have some townhomes in them.

That's the B20 and the B21. Then an eight-story larger building, which is B22. Collectively, that's 93 units.

Then kitty corner to that at Elm and Cambridge, you'll see a building B16. That's the six units. Again, the six units are in the amended PD 1006.

The 93 units are in a new plan development that we hopefully will get approval for today. Those are really the only... That's the development that's being proposed, but we did have to do it in three different ordinances.

Hopefully that made some sense.

[Speaker 13] (3:02:43 - 3:02:51)
All right. Go back to the map.

[Speaker 1] (3:02:54 - 3:03:01)
Yes. What are we doing with block six and block eight?

[Speaker 8] (3:03:02 - 3:03:52)
So block six is the subject of a new plan development, which is matter 21081 before you today. That will be this plan development that just got put on the screen, Alderman. That is the development on block six.

Block eight... Wait, wait. How many units?

93 units. So now with the other one. Block eight is...

Nothing is being proposed with block eight other than it's being rezoned to a DR3 classification. It is owned and controlled by CHA and it will be presumably CHA's next phase of development, but nothing is being approved for it today. All right.

Questions, comments?

[Speaker 1] (3:03:53 - 3:03:59)
I know this is in 27. I know it's Walter. Walter?

[Speaker 41] (3:04:00 - 3:04:00)
Yeah.

[Speaker 1] (3:04:00 - 3:04:05)
Oh, I'm sorry. Let's start with Walter.

[Speaker 4] (3:04:06 - 3:05:40)
Okay. So thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. First of all, we appreciate hosting development in their partnership with the LACCDC, which is residents from Cabrini.

We appreciate all of the development that he has done so far. He has momentum going. He has beautiful developments that really have helped to enhance mixed income back into this community.

I'm okay with all of this, but I'm kind of not okay with all of this because I don't really want CHA to take the land back from him because he's been doing such a great job and then take a hundred years to get somebody else to do it, right? But it is what it is. He met his numbers as far as the replacement of CHA housing on his site.

So hopefully if and when the RFPs come out for the rest of this land, those other two lots that he's given back, that he can bid on them and continue what he's been doing over in this area already. I support this 100%. We've had community meetings.

I have a organization called the Cabrini Green Working Group, and they supported this. They went before the New North Community Organization, and they supported this. We had a community meeting.

So I support it. I ask for the committee's support. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (3:05:41 - 3:05:58)
All right. Thank you, Alderman. And Stephen, I know you made it simpler, but I want to hear from Mr. Holstein because he has a record of affordability in the city, bar none, right?

So Peter, would you like to say a few words?

[Speaker 27] (3:05:58 - 3:07:41)
Thank you, Alderman. Good afternoon. My name is Peter Holstein, President of Holstein Real Estate Development.

We first started working on this site in 2003, working along Division Street. We did for sale and rental. We were pretty much pre-sold on, what, 263 for sale units.

We were pre-sold, and then 2008 hit. We survived that by doing some forgiveness on the construction loan with the support of HUD, CHA, and the city. We were able to sell out and keep going.

The rest of what we've been doing here is rental. The entire site, by the time we're done with the 99 units, we'll be at 793 total units, 252 CHA units, 209 affordable, and 332 market rate, both rental and for sale. Our partner, the Cabrini-Green Residence Organization, is a 40% partner.

They get full benefits of working with us, and it's been a pleasure working with them. So this is our second development in the Cabrini-Green area, the first one, North Town Village, we did in 1999. So we've been working in the area for not quite 24 years, and we've got a lot of good housing, and we're really happy with the way it turned out.

[Speaker 1] (3:07:42 - 3:08:08)
Thank you, Peter. I will not be the alderman next year, but you need to talk to hopefully my successor about working with CTA on the redevelopment of around Belmont. Belmont and Clark did the plan.

We need affordable there. It has been something that I want you to take an active interest in, but that's not today's discussion. I understand.

[Speaker 27] (3:08:08 - 3:08:20)
I haven't seen you in a while. I've talked on the phone. We've talked about this, and I assure you, I will not forget getting involved there.

Because I think, I mean, obviously you did a lot, Wilson Yards, if I'm not mistaken.

[Speaker 1] (3:08:21 - 3:08:32)
Yes. Okay. So you know what to deal with.

I know what it is. Yes, sir. All right.

Let me read. I'm going to take a motion for all three at once. I'm sorry.

Alderman Kaplan.

[Speaker 35] (3:08:33 - 3:08:45)
I just want to speak on behalf of Peter Holston. This guy can move mountains. I mean, he knows affordable housing like anyone else I've ever met.

So I applaud the work that he's doing. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:08:46 - 3:09:29)
Thank you. All right. So I'm going to read them into the record.

I need a motion to pass. Move do pass on items 21079, 21080, and 21081. Noting that 21080 and 21081 are being passed as revised.

And Alderman Kaplan makes that motion on all three. Any objections? Hearing none, these three items are passed, two as revised.

Thank you very much. Thank you very much. All right.

Nice to see you. All right.

[Speaker 25] (3:09:29 - 3:09:31)
We've got one item left, but we've got to defer the next two.

[Speaker 1] (3:09:31 - 3:10:31)
Okay. So we will be, we are on page eight. I will.

Okay. We're going to need a defer at the request of Alderman Taylor on the following two items. Document number 21108T1, 20th Ward.

This address is on 47th, 1515 through 1525 West 47th and South Justine. And then I'll read the second one in document number 21109T1 in the 20th Ward. Ordinance was deferred on July 20th of 2022.

This common address, 1641 West 47th street. So I need a motion to defer both of these items at the request of Alderman Taylor. That would be Alderman Hadden makes the motion to defer.

Any objections? Hearing none, these two items are deferred. I think to one meeting, right?

[Speaker 29] (3:10:31 - 3:10:31)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (3:10:32 - 3:10:53)
All right. Now we're on page nine document number 22008 13th Ward ordinance was deferred on October 26th of 2022. Common address is 5923 West 63rd street.

And the change request from B11 neighborhood shopping district to C21 motor vehicle related commercial district, Mark Kupiak.

[Speaker 33] (3:10:53 - 3:11:19)
Thank you, Alderman. I'm Mark Kupiak. I'm an attorney and I represent the owner applicant, Eladio Montoya.

And before I begin one procedural matter, I did submit a substitute, a proposed substitute ordinance to staff and to the city upon further research that we don't need the C2 and the substitute would barely ask the rezoning to a C1-1. So if you have that.

[Speaker 1] (3:11:19 - 3:11:41)
All right. So department you're cool with that. Okay.

Alderman Roboius moves to accept the substitute by the same roll call it was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the substitutes before us.

And let me reiterate, we're going from B11 now to C1-1. Okay.

[Speaker 33] (3:11:43 - 3:11:43)
Sure.

[Speaker 13] (3:11:44 - 3:11:44)
Okay.

[Speaker 33] (3:11:45 - 3:12:45)
All right. Proceed. Okay.

With that Eladio is the owner of the property. Also the applicant in this application properties improve with an existing commercial building. Building has an existing popular ice cream store in the building called Los Mangos, retail ice cream sales.

The zoning change would allow food production, specifically ice cream as a permitted use. And it would allow Eladio to make the ice cream on site. It will also allow him to get an appropriate city business license.

He will continue his retail sales just as they are. We spoke with the Alderman. The Alderman was familiar with the current use mentioned it's a nice business.

Also the Alderman mentioned before Eladio opened the ice cream store in 2019, that building had been vacant for about 10 years prior. So actually his business there has been nice for the block. And with that, I believe the Alderman had sent his letter of support.

[Speaker 1] (3:12:45 - 3:13:28)
And with that, I ask for your support. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Quinn. Any questions, comments?

Hearing none, Alderwoman Hadden makes a motion to move do pass by the same roll call. Chairman Quorum, objections to that? Hearing none, this item is passed as amended.

Thank you. And with that, I don't think we have any further business. Alderman Kappelman makes a motion to adjourn by the same roll call as Chairman Quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, this meeting is adjourned. I'm not even going to turn around.
