[Speaker 1] (3:40 - 3:50)
Good morning, colleagues. I know the San Diego weather has precluded you from getting in on the Zoom call. We've got a few more members before we can start.

[Speaker 18] (3:52 - 3:52)
Good morning.

[Speaker 1] (3:53 - 8:28)
Morning. Hi, Carrie. Morning, everybody.

The June 22nd, 2021 Committee on Zoning Landmarks and Building Standards is called to order. Pursuant to applicable law, the chairman has determined that an in-person meeting is not practical or prudent. Accordingly, attendance of this meeting will be by remote means only.

We will start off with a roll call. Committee members, please unmute yourself and please note that your yes or present response will be deemed to be a yes vote when this quorum call is used as a reference vote for later items. All right, we'll start with Alderman Hopkins.

[Speaker 1] (9:40 - 10:47)
Alderman Osterman. Alderman Hadden. Present.

And I, Chairman Tunney, is here. So we have 14 and we do have a quorum. Okay, we'll now move on to the approval of the Rule 45 report containing the minutes of the May 2021 hearings of the Committee on Zoning, Landmark, and Building Standards.

All members of this committee should have received a copy of these reports electronically and if hearing no objections, do I have a motion by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum to approve the minutes? So moved, Mr. Chairman, by Alderman Austin. Alderman Austin makes that motion.

Any objections to our motion? Hearing no objections, the reports have been approved. Let's see.

We have Alderman Smith. You want to be recognized for the quorum?

[Speaker 4] (10:48 - 10:50)
Yes, yes, Alderman Tunney.

[Speaker 1] (10:54 - 10:58)
Okay, we'll recognize you as present, but you are not a member of the committee.

[Speaker 6] (10:58 - 10:59)
That's correct, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (11:00 - 11:03)
Okay, wait a second. I want to get Alderman Osterman.

[Speaker 21] (11:04 - 11:05)
Same thing.

[Speaker 1] (11:05 - 11:06)
Okay.

[Speaker 21] (11:06 - 11:09)
15 members now. So 15.

[Speaker 1] (11:10 - 11:13)
I don't see any other hands up. Okay.

[Speaker 6] (11:14 - 11:15)
Did you get me, Mr. Chairman?

[Speaker 1] (11:16 - 11:17)
That's Alderman Beal.

[Speaker 6] (11:17 - 11:17)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (11:18 - 11:20)
We have you now, sir. All right.

[Speaker 16] (11:22 - 11:24)
Alderman Burnett is here.

[Speaker 1] (11:24 - 12:52)
And that is another committee member. Alderman Burnett is recognized. Okay, great.

Okay, so now we're gonna move on to hear the items to be deferred. I'll read the ward, the file number, the address, and page number, and take a motion for all at the end. So before we get into the list of deferrals, I want to bring to the committee's attention, because I've been approached by someone wanting to hear something that has not been in front of the Planning Commission.

So upon legal counsel, and they're on the call, their statement is that they have not been before the Planning Commission. Procedurally, these items need a recommendation from the Planning Commission before the committee can consider them. So from a process point of view, we can't do a direct up-and-down that has not been to the Planning Commission.

So I know one of our colleagues, I should say, is very opinionated about a particular issue, but I think from a legal point of view, we need to wait until the recommendation, or not, from the Planning Commission is referred to the City Council on Zoning. With that, before I go into the individual deferrals, I see committee member Raymond Lopez. Raymond?

[Speaker 8] (12:54 - 13:57)
Thank you, Chairman, and good morning members of the committee. I am familiar with the item that we're discussing. It is, I believe, number 20699 in the 41st Ward, and I believe that, forgive me, that's my dog squeaking in the background if anyone hears it.

I believe that legal counsel has provided us with an explanation of the Municipal Code, Chapter 17, here from the Planning Commission, but we've already addressed this issue. We addressed this a few years ago. As a body, we've rejected this plan development, even after the Planning Commission's recommendation back then.

So I would respectfully disagree, Chairman, and ask that we act on this now, because there's nothing in the Municipal Code that says we have to wait for the recommendation. It merely states that the Planning Commission has to provide us with one.

[Speaker 1] (13:57 - 13:57)
Okay.

[Speaker 8] (13:57 - 14:02)
The second phase of the receipt of the application.

[Speaker 1] (14:03 - 14:47)
So the application that we all voted on in the last City Council is not the application that's in front of us today. So they refiled under a brand new application, and while it, I don't know the substance of it, because it's not been heard by the Planning Commission, I understand it's fairly similar, but it is a brand new application. So from their rights as an applicant, they have a right to be heard and an up-down, again, recommendation from the Planning Commission before we get it.

So before that, though, I know Jeff is on the call. Jeff Levine, you want to instruct the committee what your legal recommendation is?

[Speaker 14] (14:49 - 16:19)
Sure. Good morning, Chairman and members of the committee. Jeff Levine with the Law Department.

Chairman Tunney, you've essentially stated it correctly. The Municipal Code does provide for this sequenced process. Moreover, I'm aware of nothing in the Municipal Code that states that once a matter has been considered, it is forever precluded from being raised at a later date.

I think such a rule would be problematic for any piece of legislation because circumstances change. Moreover, I think based on some information I've received from the Department of Planning and Development, there are some changes inherent in the current application, and therefore, I think that would further render inapplicable any kind of position that the matter has already been finally determined. So I think what I would say is that I would recommend that the committee adhere to its usual practice that is provided for in the Municipal Code, which calls for Plan Commission review at this juncture.

[Speaker 8] (16:20 - 16:32)
And Chairman, that being stated, if I may, then I would make a motion to table this item until the February 2022 meeting of the Zoning Committee, if there's no other questions on this topic.

[Speaker 1] (16:38 - 16:49)
Jeff, is that motion in order at this point, or is that effectively the same result by not hearing it in a reasonable time?

[Speaker 14] (16:51 - 18:01)
Well, I would have some concerns about offering legal advice in a public setting. I think from a procedural standpoint, I think Alderman Lopez is essentially making a motion to defer or postpone to a time certain, which is a legitimate motion. I think that seeking to postpone it for several months, I don't know whether as a factual matter that would have the practical effect of rendering it moot or whether it would still be viable.

I would say as a general principle, the farther out the motion to defer, the more likely it could create room for argument by the applicant that the city is in effect denying it.

[Speaker 8] (18:04 - 18:08)
Being a solid motion, I renew my motion if there's no other objections to it.

[Speaker 1] (18:14 - 18:25)
All we do have Alderman Napolitano on the on the on the call. Will you yield to hear him speak?

[Speaker 8] (18:26 - 18:29)
I'll hold it until they're finished.

[Speaker 1] (18:30 - 18:32)
Okay, well Hopkins is a committee member and so we'll start with Brian.

[Speaker 14] (18:33 - 18:44)
It is a debatable motion, so we can't take a vote on it. You can entertain debate on the motion as you're doing.

[Speaker 1] (18:44 - 18:49)
Okay, Alderman Hopkins, is that hand up or not?

[Speaker 19] (18:52 - 19:02)
Yeah, Mr. Chairman, if a vote is indicated, that's fine. I was going to make a do not pass motion on this, but I will yield on that in the face of legal advice from council.

[Speaker 1] (19:03 - 19:19)
Okay, so then I'm again, I'm calling my committee members. I know Anthony Napolitano, your hand is up, but I just I'm gonna yield to Brendan as a committee member and Brendan Riley.

[Speaker 24] (19:20 - 19:28)
Chairman, actually I'll wait to hear from my colleague Alderman Napolitano. I want to make sure I can hear his thoughts first. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (19:28 - 19:32)
Okay, Alderman Napolitano.

[Speaker 23] (19:34 - 20:55)
Thank you, Chairman. I appreciate the opportunity to speak. I would like to support Ray's motion and the reason so is in 2017 and 2018, this proposal was brought to planning without a letter of support from me and it went through planning and planning referred it to Zoning Committee and the Zoning Committee gratefully observed that the 41st Ward, myself, and our Zoning Advisory Board Committee did not support this plan to begin with and they supported us and they voted it down in 2018.

My fear is how this is progressing that this is just coming back again and this will happen on time to time to probably all of our wards now when a project is voted down that it's just going to come back in and try to go past the Alderman who actually answers to the constituents on what projects are accepted into the ward. We didn't support it then, we don't support it now. I'm hoping that my colleagues can understand that and that this is the direction that planning could be going in the future and I hope it's not and I appreciate your time to let this be heard, Chairman, and I would support Alderman Lopez's motion.

[Speaker 1] (20:56 - 22:34)
Okay, so Alderman Napolitano, as was stated, I obviously I was on Planning Commission during that period and I've also supported you at Planning Commission that I've also supported you with zoning. My question to you is this is a new application, you know, process-wise I'm sure there was a lot of money invested in behalf of the applicant to prepare for introduction and hopefully referral to the committee, you know, obviously no one is withdrawing your right to be the representative of your community and to speak out and ultimately entertain a compromise and if not not to support it and then ultimately the Planning Commission decides whether they're up down and support again. So you have two bites at the apple moving forward.

The, you know, I'm concerned and I'm not the lawyer in the room but I'm concerned that this is a legal problem if we if we do not give it some kind of due process. If there's a feeling that May of 22 is still due process that's going to be up to the applicant. So I just, you know, I know that you have support as your position as the Alderman and I worry just from the legal aspects of this and and and precedent too.

So that's just my two my two cents worth if before we get on to Alderman Riley and Alderman Beatle. Jeff was that was that stated properly on behalf of the chairman?

[Speaker 14] (22:35 - 23:04)
No I think I think chairman you're you're generally stating it correctly. I would suggest that if if the members of the committee wish to wish to engage in a more detailed discussion of legal concerns that we the committee could stand in recess for for a short period I could speak to members individually.

[Speaker 1] (23:06 - 23:12)
All right well let's see what we have Alderman Riley up on this.

[Speaker 24] (23:13 - 25:14)
Thank you chairman. I understand what Jeff Levine is saying about process. I had a separate conversation with the legislative reference bureau and they said it is a bit bit of a murky area and so not not not exactly clear-cut per se and I would agree with Jeff we probably should discuss all of that publicly however this committee has jurisdiction over overall zoning matters in the city of Chicago and members here can make decisions to delay votes put off items vote down items and I understand while this is typically considered to be a regular process it's highly irregular that the developer has now for is taking now a third shot at passing the same project effectively over the objections of the local community and their elected representative on the City Council and for me that's not a sign of good things to come. They're looking to impose their will upon a community that has spoken loud and clear through the representative not once but twice and here we are a third time and I I do share my colleagues concerns that you know this could be you know the new the new new we're just gonna file these applications and try and ram them through and the fact that local alderman the local community was not engaged before this application was filed I think is indicative of what we can expect from this development so if Alderman Napolitano wants this deferred I I defer to him it's I believe it's his choice and I wouldn't want someone pushing something through over my objections either because we're all held accountable by our constituents for these decisions so that's my two cents and I'll be supporting the motion thank you.

[Speaker 1] (25:15 - 25:20)
All right I'm gonna ask Anthony Beal Alderman Beal.

[Speaker 6] (25:20 - 26:17)
Thank you Mr. Chairman Mr. Chairman I have to agree with my colleagues I think that there is precedence that this was voted down and even though it is been rewritten it is the same project and so we do have precedence that we have voted this particular item down so therefore I think we do have legal standings in order to vote it down and we have that to back it up just like Alderman Riley just stated this is this the second the third time that this project is coming around and the project the project is not supported by the community or the alderman then and it's not supported by it now so I don't see why we would not have legal standings to take action on this whether we vote it down or defer it to a time certain and so I support my colleague on that motion and I also want to second the motion by Alderman Lopez moving forward thank you.

[Speaker 1] (26:18 - 26:27)
Thank you and last but not least well I shouldn't say last but not least about Chairman Wagesvecht followed by Chairman Olsen.

[Speaker 2] (26:28 - 27:26)
Thanks Chairman you know I have to agree with my colleagues and I think Alderman Riley looking at LRB and asking the question there it does seem pretty murky and it I think tries to do away with procedures and jurisdiction that we've established over decades but my question for Alderman Lopez if I could is just what Nexus was there to February 22 and I just didn't know if there was particular date there that we had missed or if that was just a date that you had thought was appropriate for this because I think we're some of us on Planning Commission we do see some things come on pretty quickly but there's also a time frame there that that you know you can't just jump on the Planning Commission either so I just curious as to what the February date was for and that's all I had.

[Speaker 8] (27:28 - 27:50)
Just on the question February 22. Thank you Chairman I chose the February date because municipal code section 17-13-0608 says that if City Council takes no action within six months the matter shall be considered dead that is seven months from now. So in effect it would be ending this.

[Speaker 1] (27:50 - 28:11)
That might be six month period might be only action that the Planning Commission takes that the subsequent City Council zoning meeting does not. This upends the process by in the beginning of aborting it so to speak. Alderman Osterman.

[Speaker 33] (28:15 - 28:59)
Yeah thank you Mr. Chairman I guess the question I think the issue going pushing this out six months well I think Alderman Lopez says that that's what the code indicates or that our rules indicate I think we may want to entertain doing that shorter I guess I have a question to Alderman Napolitano and if he could for the members of the committee give a little bit of a snapshot as to the objections from the community and does he see this as an option or there does he see room for refinement of the plan that would be acceptable and also create some housing units in this community.

[Speaker 1] (29:04 - 29:12)
Okay so I'm going to hear from Anthony Napolitano and then I'm going to call for a recess. Alderman Napolitano.

[Speaker 23] (29:16 - 30:07)
Thank you Chairman. The biggest issue with this too is this is on a commercial business corridor of ours. This is PD's own commercial right now this would set a humongous precedent in that area in changing a PD from commercial to residential in there.

Unfortunately for this project I'm an alderman that listens to my constituents in the surrounding suburbs that are adamantly against this as well. They'd like to keep the area commercial we need more jobs. There are thousands and thousands of residential vacancies in our apartments and with a lot of vacancies less than a hundred and fifty yards to the north of here.

So I think what we should be pushing for is this remain commercial bring more jobs to our city and not set a precedent in our business corridor over there turning it all into residential.

[Speaker 1] (30:08 - 40:36)
Thank you Anthony. So it is 1027 on my clock. Let's give it about a ten minute recess and we'll be back.

Thank you. Okay we're back from recess. Everybody online?

Okay. We've been waiting. Oh is your hand up or are you just blurting it out?

I'm gonna call on you Raymond to renew your motion. Raymond Lopez.

[Speaker 8] (40:38 - 40:50)
I'm sorry Chairman I renew my motion to table this item to the February 2022 meeting of the committee.

[Speaker 1] (40:51 - 40:57)
All right that's his motion and seconded by Beal. Any objections to the motion?

[Speaker 37] (40:59 - 41:01)
I'd like a roll call on that please.

[Speaker 1] (41:02 - 41:32)
Alderman Hatton is calling for a roll call. All right so obviously voting in the affirmative would delay this until February of 22 and voting no would would be to send it to the Planning Commission upon the deferral of me as chairman. All right.

Chairman did you repeat the second part? Jeff do you want to correct my statement?

[Speaker 14] (41:32 - 41:49)
Yeah I think the the the motion is is more simply characterized which is simply that Alderman Lopez is seeking to defer zoning committee consideration of this item until February of 2022.

[Speaker 1] (41:50 - 41:58)
End of statement. Okay all right any questions? All right we'll start with the roll call.

All right now we'll move on to public comment period. We have two speakers signed up for today's hearing and we will hear from them now. Our first speaker is Susan Bogey.

[Speaker 22] (52:25 - 55:29)
Thank you Chairman Tunney and members of the committee for allowing me to speak on behalf of my building and neighborhood regarding 1810 to 1820 North Wells Street. My name is Susan Bogey. I'm president of Williamsburg Gardens Homeowners Association at 200 West Menominee Street.

The east side of our building is 1800 to 1806 North Wells. Next door but one is 1810 North Wells. We request a delay in the zoning vote until proper notice is given within the required 250 foot distance.

Once again the notice about this zoning committee meeting has not been received by many residents in the affected area which is unacceptable. In my building 10 out of 15 residents did not receive a letter about this meeting. Reminder there's only one house between us and 1810 North Wells.

Zach Bleicher chair of the Historic District Planning and Zoning Committee of the Old Town Tribal Association has also asked Alderman Michelle Smith to request a delay of the vote to revise the zoning of 1810 to 1820 North Wells Street. Late aldermanic decisions and confusing communications seem to be a disadvantage to the neighborhood and an advantage to the developer. Alderman Smith has been repeatedly asked to attend a meeting in the neighborhood to explain the proposed zoning changes and answer our questions.

Instead we've received conflicting emails mentioning multiple zoning designations confusing neighbors still further. Going from B1-3 to B1-1-5 where retail must be on the second floor then B1-1-5 to B2-2 which allows apartments on the first floor now B1-1-1.5 to B2.2 to B1.2. We just can't get a straight answer. As residents in the area we strongly feel that retail must stay in 1816 to 1820.

It helps reduce housing density. It creates a neighborhood with a combination of residential and retail and it helps reduce our tax base. We also don't understand why a request to change the zoning for 1816 to 1820 is included in this request.

1810 North Wells was declassified over the objections of the neighborhood and should therefore seemingly be the only building affected by the zoning change. There's no obvious reason for 1816 to 1820 North Wells zoning to be changed except for possibly developer greed. One final note everyone in the area is a member of the Old Town Tribal Association so communicating with them only is not communicating with the neighborhood.

[Speaker 1] (55:31 - 55:33)
Our next speaker Diane Gonzalez.

[Speaker 28] (55:40 - 58:06)
Good morning my name is Diane Gonzalez and I'm a long-term resident of the Old Town Triangle who resides within 250 feet of this proposed zoning change. I ask you today as did my colleague and neighbor to delay this or if not I say we should hope that you would deny the zoning change for 1810 to 1820 North Wells. Why would Old Town who supports down zoning a stable portion not want this down zoning to include two storefront structures to the north?

Five reasons. One, keeping retail at the ground level is imperative in our neighborhood. The zoning change doesn't require this.

Two, a number of property owners within the required 250 feet were not notified by mail. Three, neighbors were told zoning would change from B1-3 to B1-1.5 but the notice that was received stated zoning would change to B2-2. When some sharp owners caught the difference the alderman was contacted.

The alderman sent a corrected letter and apology to some constituents this past Friday about 5 o'clock. On Saturday morning I was contacted by three neighbors who were confused. What if someone hadn't caught this?

How did the alderman's office not know what zoning is allowed? I replied that there was an explanatory letter, an apology and an offer to contact their office. Number four, the alderman's letter furthered that the developer will maintain existing retail which as we said is important.

He also agreed to rezone the property to B1-2 after the project is approved and built. Neighbors felt that's a difficult guarantee. How could this work?

Number five, as a result of the confusion and last-minute discoveries a number of neighbors including the neighborhood historic district committee chair asked for a month's delay to discuss this with the developer and with the alderman. The alderman declined. Now nearby neighbors and I ask again for a delay or if not would you deny this change?

We support our alderman to downsize the former stables but we see no need to change the status of the other two buildings with important street level storefronts. Commissioners, look out for us please. This is our neighborhood.

We have worked so hard for 40 years plus to maintain. This is not a game of tiddlywinks where we hop about confused about the protocols and zoning amendment. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (58:11 - 58:29)
We will now move on to the addendum to the agenda. We have one appointment up today, document number A-2021-39, the reappointment of Jolene Saul as a member of the Zoning Board of Appeals. Jolene is here with us and would like to say a few words.

[Speaker 24] (1:00:11 - 1:00:14)

[Speaker 9] (1:00:14 - 1:00:15)
Can I be added to the roll please?

[Speaker 1] (1:00:16 - 1:01:21)
You sure can. You missed them some early fireworks. You know.

All right. Now we'll move on. Let's see what we're gonna move on.

All right so I'm going to move a little bit out of the order at the request of Chairman Dowell. We have we think three relatively expedient matters to get through the council as she has an engagement with the mayor. All right so we're going to move to page nine bottom of page nine application number 20714 third ward ordinance was referred on May 26th of 21.

Common address is 5410 through 5412 South Dearborn Street and the change request. RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district. Let's see Nick Patikas or Daniel Box.

[Speaker 12] (1:01:21 - 1:02:22)
Good morning Mr. Chairman members of the committee. For the record my name is Daniel Box. I'm an attorney with the Law Offices of Sam Banks and I'm here today on behalf of the applicant Center Court Development LLC.

The applicant is the owner of the subject property located at 5410 through 12 South Dearborn Street. The property is currently vacant and unimproved and the applicant is seeking to permit a new three-story two-unit residential building at the subject property. The proposed building will measure 38 feet in height and on-site garage parking for two cars will be provided at the lots rear.

In order to permit the project as Mr. Chairman had indicated the applicant is seeking a zoning change from an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district. We worked with the local community and Alderman Dowell on this project. I believe a letter of support is already on file for that for this application and with that I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have.

[Speaker 1] (1:02:23 - 1:02:31)
Daniel we do have a letter on file and support but I know Alderman Dowell is probably on the call would you like to talk about this one Pat?

[Speaker 9] (1:02:32 - 1:02:58)
Very briefly Chairman thank you for the consideration this morning. These three are in support of housing that will be built around the excess tennis facility which is a new facility in my ward and I support all of the zoning changes you're going to hear this morning.

[Speaker 1] (1:02:59 - 1:03:19)
So what we'll do is obviously we have your support for the three of them you'll only be testifying on this one? Yes. Okay thank you you're in support of all three.

Okay so questions from committee members? Hearing no questions do I have a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 8] (1:03:20 - 1:03:21)
Move to pass Chairman Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 1] (1:03:21 - 1:03:54)
That is Alderman Ray Lopez moves do pass. Any objections to the motion? Hearing none the item is passed.

We'll stay with the third ward on the top of page 10 item number 20715 the ordinance was referred on May 26th of 2021 this common address 5426 South Dearborn Street change request. RS3 residential single-unit detached house district to an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district. Daniel?

[Speaker 12] (1:03:55 - 1:04:33)
Good morning Mr. Chair once again Daniel Box attorney with the losses of Sam Banks this is an identical project so I'll keep it brief. The applicant is once again Center Court Development LLC who owns the subject property located at 5426 South Dearborn. The property is currently vacant and the applicant is seeking to permit a new three-story two-unit residential building that will be 38 feet in height with on-site garage parking for two cars at the rear of the lot.

In order to permit the project we're seeking a zoning change from an RS3 residential single-unit detached house district to an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district. If you have any questions I'd be happy to answer them.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:36 - 1:04:38)
Thank you Daniel. Questions by committee members?

[Speaker 6] (1:04:39 - 1:04:39)
So moved.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:41 - 1:05:25)
Hearing no questions Alderman Beal makes a motion to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none the item is passed and it's actually I would really like to see a site visited with this this complex with the tenants and the surrounding it seems I know Alderman Dowell was extremely supportive and instrumental in making that happen so it looks like the contiguous development is a good place to work out and live so I look forward to going down there and seeing it so and then my understanding is Daniel I hear there's a rumor out that you're leaving this great city of Chicago and this might be your last zoning meeting?

[Speaker 12] (1:05:26 - 1:05:40)
That's true I guess word gets around unfortunately it's bittersweet I love the city of Chicago and I love working here at San Banks Law but I am originally from Dallas so I'll be moving back home to Texas here in the next eight days.

[Speaker 1] (1:05:41 - 1:05:47)
Well as somebody who lived in Dallas you talk too fast for a person from Dallas so maybe you'll slow down when you get down there.

[Speaker 12] (1:05:48 - 1:05:52)
I think so y'all have taught me well thank you so much Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (1:05:53 - 1:06:22)
Okay now we're moving the last item in Alderman Dowell's ward is a document number 20692 T1 third ward address 3933 to 3935 South Prairie Avenue and the change request M13 limited manufacturing business park district the RM5 residential multi-unit district and we have Walter Freeman on this one Walter.

[Speaker 5] (1:06:25 - 1:06:57)
Good morning Mr. Chairman members of the committee for the record again I am Walter Freeman and yes I'm looking to do a zoning change for a double lot 3933 to 3935 South Prairie from M1-3 to RM-5 for a two-story actually is a single unit with a two-car detached garage.

[Speaker 1] (1:07:01 - 1:07:07)
All right Walter there's a couple things do we have a substitute on this?

[Speaker 10] (1:07:08 - 1:07:15)
Yes I submitted. Let me start with that Alderman Ravois moved that we accept a substitute before us.

[Speaker 1] (1:07:15 - 1:07:24)
Alderman Ravois moved to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that?

[Speaker 8] (1:07:24 - 1:07:25)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (1:07:26 - 1:07:30)
Alderman Ray Lopez what's up?

[Speaker 8] (1:07:31 - 1:07:35)
When was the substitute received and by this committee?

[Speaker 30] (1:07:37 - 1:07:40)
I dropped it actually the substitute off this morning.

[Speaker 21] (1:07:41 - 1:07:43)
This is Anna.

[Speaker 1] (1:07:44 - 1:07:50)
Hold on let's get let's get the department Anna the question from Alderman Lopez was submitted when?

[Speaker 21] (1:07:51 - 1:07:59)
I did receive it this morning I was notified last night via email that there is a substitute from a two-unit to single-family.

[Speaker 1] (1:08:01 - 1:08:26)
That sounds like what Mr. Freeman has told the committee but as was written it does it's a two-story two-unit residential so and that being said they're obviously making it one building and with single-family I should say and I believe Chairman Dow is acknowledged of that fact.

[Speaker 25] (1:08:27 - 1:08:42)
Yes, Mr. Chairman I am aware of this Mr. Freeman is a longtime resident in the community and is building his home on this property so I am aware that this is a single-family.

[Speaker 1] (1:08:43 - 1:08:53)
Okay so with that I'm gonna ask Alderman Ravois moves to accept the substantive narrative and plans for the type 1 application by the same roll call.

[Speaker 8] (1:08:55 - 1:09:00)
Any objections? And again I will be objecting and voting no on accepting the substitute.

[Speaker 1] (1:09:01 - 1:09:19)
Okay so we have one of objector any other objectors? Hearing on the the item is the substantive narrative and plans will be in front of us and Mr. Freeman I think you want to reiterate the fact that this is a single-family home?

[Speaker 5] (1:09:20 - 1:09:22)
Yes it is a single-family home.

[Speaker 1] (1:09:22 - 1:09:53)
All right all right so we have the substitute and are there other questions or comments on the substitute? All right so if there are no other questions I need a motion to move by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Alderman Ravois makes the motion.

Any objections to the motion on this one? Hearing none the item is passed.

[Speaker 4] (1:09:55 - 1:09:59)
Mr. Chairman thank you again for your consideration this morning.

[Speaker 1] (1:09:59 - 1:11:19)
Thank you and just for the record we're passing this with the substitute stuff substitute narrative and plans it's early in the meeting. All right thank you very much good luck to you Chairman Dow. All right okay now we are now we are going to move top of page 8 will the direct introduction to the committee amending ordinance s 0 2 0 2 0 dash 4 1 0 1 and 0 2 0 2 1 dash 797 modifying the expiration date of a temporary emergency government authorized shelter.

I believe it's in the fourth board yeah all committee members should have received a copy of this ordinance last Friday and at this time I would like to take a motion to accept the direct introduction to the committee by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Alderman Lopez moves that motion. Any objections to the motion?

Okay hearing none the direct introduction is in front of us. We have Christine Riley Director of Homeless Prevention Policy and Planning here from the Department of Family and Support Services to speak on this matter. Christine you may proceed.

[Speaker 25] (1:11:19 - 1:13:03)
Thank you Chairman Taney. Thank you everyone. Yes the Department of Family and Support Services is asking for an extension of zoning for Young Women's Leadership Academy in Alderman Sophia King's ward.

We have been in close contact and working closely with the Chicago Department of Public Health and based on their recommendations we are now entering in a phase where we're bringing our decompressed shelter system back to a new normal bringing beds back online and because of this we are not able to close the current shelter Young Women's Leadership Academy and requesting an extension until August 31st which will be the final extension for this. We are making plans with CDPH to continue to work with the lead coordinating health agencies who are currently working within Young Women's Leadership Academy as well as other shelter providers to bring shelter beds back online so that we can move the current women from Young Women's Leadership Academy into those available shelter beds as well as working with the Expedited Housing Initiative in continuing to house the population there. We have stopped referrals to Young Women's Leadership Academy already so we did get approval from Alderman King I believe she's on this committee meeting call but we are requesting an extension of to August 31st and yes I'm going to ask Alderman Sophia King if you'd like to say a few words on this on the project.

[Speaker 1] (1:13:04 - 1:13:12)
I know she's been very supportive and I understand it's a pretty successful project. Alderman King.

[Speaker 15] (1:13:13 - 1:14:06)
Yeah thank you Chairman. I'm happy to again stand in support of this particular project in the ward. You know during COVID obviously there were a lot of folks who were had insecure housing and this facility really stood stepped up.

I think they've been doing an excellent job of you know not only taking in some of our most vulnerable folks but making sure that they get permanent housing and so I'm happy to give them more time in order to make sure that they can more effectively support our most vulnerable folks in the city so happy to stand in support of this again.

[Speaker 1] (1:14:07 - 1:14:13)
Thank you Alderwoman. I see Alderman Osterman's hand is up. Alderman Osterman.

Thank you Chairman.

[Speaker 33] (1:14:13 - 1:15:15)
Just want to commend Alderwoman King on making this work in her community and really helping the women and families that have been there and working with the neighbors. A point to Miss Riley is that I really want her department and Public Health to look at citywide how we move to expand and support more shelters. We're gonna have federal money coming through us.

There's the potential for evictions that are gonna be hitting our city and now is the time to act to come up with a more robust shelter system so that we can temporarily house people to get them into permanent housing. That can't wait so that's gonna be an issue that's gonna come before your department and Public Health during the budget. I would just ask you to let the Commissioner and get on that now so but otherwise stand in support of this and motion to pass at the appropriate time.

[Speaker 1] (1:15:17 - 1:15:36)
Thank you Alderman. I do not see other hands up so Alderman Osterman makes the motion move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to his motion?

Hearing none the item is passed. All right.

[Speaker 5] (1:15:37 - 1:15:37)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:15:37 - 1:16:19)
Thank you. All right let's now we have document number 0 2 0 2 1 dash 2 1 5 4 the amendment of Municipal Code Titles 4 7 13 14 a 14 B 14 R and 15 regarding technical corrections to the construction related provisions and the associated correction of the City Council Journal of Proceedings of February 19th of 2020. There is a substitute ordinance for this item.

All committee members should have received a copy of the substitute as well as a summary of the changes on Friday and if there are no objections do I hear a motion to pass?

[Speaker 19] (1:16:20 - 1:16:21)
Alderman Hopkins moves to accept the substitute.

[Speaker 1] (1:16:22 - 1:16:30)
Okay so Alderman Hopkins moves to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that motion?

[Speaker 8] (1:16:31 - 1:16:33)
Yes Chairman. Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 1] (1:16:34 - 1:17:19)
Alderman Lopez is recorded as opposing that. Any others? So with that being said over the objection of Alderman Lopez the substitute in front of us.

All right we have Commissioner Bode to speak on the matter. Commissioner, my staff phonetically is spelling your name so I apologize from the past. I had a laugh about that one.

So can you speak on the on the on the changes and the technical corrections. I know that we've talked a little about these things but let's get an overview for the committee members.

[Speaker 9] (1:17:20 - 1:21:12)
Yes absolutely. So good morning Chairman Tony and honorable members of the committee and zoning landmarks and building standards. My name is Matt Bode I'm the Commissioner for the Department of Buildings.

As you're aware in 2015 DLB launched an initiative to comprehensively modernize the city's building code dating back 70 years. The council modernized the electrical code and conveyance device elevator code in 2018 and five new titles to the child construction codes in 2019. DLB at the time also made a commitment to continuous review all building related codes meet with stakeholders so the city can maintain clarity and consistency.

I'm before you today to ask for your favorable consideration of technical amendment and adjustments to various construction related provisions in this code addressing a variety of topics the majority of which are our minor updates and some type of corrections. Noteworthy in this ordinance package is a continuation of Mayor Lightfoot's commitment on demolition permit reform which a proposed update code update for the DLB review of the structural aspects of permitting and inspection for demolitions. New provisions for consideration include dividing demolitions into two categories complex demolitions and ordinary demolitions.

Along with permitting and inspection processings for each type. A complex demolition would include the demolition of a residential building more than three stories above grade or exceeding 50 feet in height. A building designed for a non-residential occupancy with more than two stories above grade or exceeding 30 feet in height.

A structure other than a building exceeding 40 feet in height. A structure with more than one basement or foundation greater than 10 feet below grade. A structure of the ground level footprint exceeding 10,000 square feet.

A building or structure with a party wall or exterior wall or foundation wall located less than one foot from a property line or from another structure that is not being demolished or any demolition accomplished by the use of wrecking ball or explosives. For the ordinance complex demolitions of the added permit requirements similar to what we typically require for major construction including the submission of structural condition report of the building or structure and a written report of safety and operational plan. Most important these demolitions will require multiple inspections throughout the demolition process depending on the building type including prior to the start of the demolition.

Ordinary demolitions are designed designated to be sorry ordinary ordinary demolitions are also designated to get final inspections. All these technical corrections reflect the department's commitment to public safety for all Chicago residents in all neighborhoods. Other items in the adjustment include codifying that individual wellness and lactation rooms are not counted on the next floor area and that would encourage the buildings to use lactation rooms and also codify that natural light requirements in living and sleeping areas apply to institutional daycare buildings as well.

So right now we have it for the regular daycares which is the young children but there are institutional daycares with older children that will put the natural light requirements. And as you discussed throughout the code update and one of the benefits of aligning with the international building code is that the IBC is frequently updated to allow us the option to take advantage of new development and technologies. For example the most recent IBC has a clearer and more uniform definition of atriums which will provide for greater direction for design professionals and we are asking to adopt that definition in today's package.

Thank you in advance for your consideration. Happy to answer any questions you have. Also on the call with me is first deputy commissioner Marlene Hopkins and managing deputy commissioner Grant Oller.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:21:13 - 1:21:43)
Thank you commissioner. Do we have questions from committee members? I don't see any hands up.

Can I get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? So moved. Alderman Raboyas makes that motion.

Any objections to his motion? And hearing none the items are passed as amended.

[Speaker 9] (1:21:44 - 1:21:45)
All right. Thank you Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:21:45 - 1:22:50)
Thank you. Let's see. Next up document number 02021-1882 historical landmark designation for the Morton Salt Company warehouse complex located at 1357 North Elston.

Before we get preservation here let's see there's a Scribner's error on a supporting document of this ordinance specifically page 7 of the document reading April 1st 2020 when it should read April 1st 2021. We do not need a substitute on this item as the error is not on the actual ordinance but rather on the cover letter of a supporting document. With that it wrote into the record we have Candlin Hawn here from the historic preservation division of the department of planning and development to present this matter.

[Speaker 32] (1:22:52 - 1:22:54)
Thank you Chairman Tunney. Can you see that powerpoint?

[Speaker 1] (1:22:56 - 1:22:59)
Yes and the iconic sign I can see it.

[Speaker 32] (1:23:00 - 1:24:54)
Yeah you can recognize it. Great. So thank you very much Chairman Tunney and Alderman.

Again my name is Candlin Hawn. I'm the project coordinator with the department of planning and development in historic preservation division and the commission on Chicago landmarks voted to recommend landmark designation of the Morton Salt Company warehouse complex at its April 1st meeting. The complex completed in 1930 and designed by architecture firm Graham Anderson Probst and White is one of the most iconic industrial sites along the north branch of the Chicago River.

The purpose-built facility was designed to house the local storage packaging and distribution operations of the Morton Salt Company founded in Chicago in 1848. The complex supported the company's midwest market for 85 years until its closure in 2015. So the Morton Salt Complex just a bit location here is located in the Westtown community sits at the southeast corner of Elston Avenue and Black Hawk Street and backs directly onto the north branch of the Chicago River.

It is located in the 27th ward. The planned development application for the project was approved at the Chicago Plan Commission on January 21 of this year. The LLC which owns the site represented by Blue Star Properties is planning the adaptive reuse and renovation of the complex into an entertainment venue with multiple tenants and uses.

The developers consent to landmark designation and Alderman Burnett has provided a letter of support. This is another rendering of the proposed project compared with the site's historic use at lower left. On behalf of the Commission on Chicago Landmarks we're requesting your support to designate the Morton Salt Company warehouse complex as a Chicago landmark.

Tyler Quest a representative for the owners is here today if you have any questions for him and I'm also available for questions. Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (1:24:58 - 1:25:05)
I believe questions from committee members. I believe if I'm not mistaken this time this is in the 27th ward correct?

[Speaker 32] (1:25:06 - 1:25:07)
Yes that is correct.

[Speaker 1] (1:25:08 - 1:25:10)
And Alderman Burnett do you have any comments on this?

[Speaker 16] (1:25:11 - 1:25:58)
Yeah uh Mr. Chairman uh first of all I'd like to uh thank the uh folks from planning and landmarks uh for their work on this and also the developer for their cooperation with this. We think this is going to be a beautiful development so happy that they are keeping the Morton Salt sign and the I think the little lady with the umbrella over there. So we really appreciate it.

This is going to be a music venue and they should bring some economic development to the city. We get some out of town money coming here so I think this is exciting. So I support it 100 percent.

Thank you. Questions committee members?

[Speaker 1] (1:25:59 - 1:26:02)
I see Alderman Villegas has his hand up. Gil.

[Speaker 24] (1:26:04 - 1:26:29)
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I just wanted to congratulate Chairman Burnett on this exciting project and also making sure that we save this iconic landmark. The fact that um that this project is going to be turned into a music venue is just really cool for the city going to generate generate a lot of economic development and I just wanted to congratulate my colleague.

Thank you Gil.

[Speaker 1] (1:26:29 - 1:27:08)
Alderman Waguespack. Scott do you want to talk on Morton Salt auditorium so to speak? All right well hey all right Scott all right well I my assumption is because we've talked about this entertainment complex that he is excited about that as am I.

I don't see any other hands up. All right uh let's see can I get a motion moved to pass by the same roll call that we used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 17] (1:27:10 - 1:27:11)
So moved by Alderman David Moore.

That was all the Minnesota SPAC makes the motion.

[Speaker 9] (1:29:50 - 1:29:51)
Okay thanks.

[Speaker 1] (1:29:51 - 1:31:06)
And any objections to his motion? Hearing none these items are passed. The orders sign orders are passed.

All right now we'll move on to the regular agenda in an effort to minimize technical difficulties and to ensure the committee meeting runs as smoothly as possible. The typical order in which items will be heard has been updated throughout the duration of the virtual committee on zoning meetings. Items will be grouped together according to witness attorney and will be heard in that order rather than the order.

And we will start on page one. Let's see this is document number A8617 43rd ward. Ordinance was referred on November 16th of 2020.

Common address is 1810 through 1820 North Well Street and the change request B13 neighborhood shopping district to B22 neighborhood mixed use district. And this is Alderman Michelle Smith's ordinance. And for the benefit of committee members the public speakers both accommodated on a number of issues but they were not in support of it.

[Speaker 4] (1:31:07 - 1:35:03)
All right Alderman Smith. Thank you very much Mr. Chairman. To remind the committee this was on the agenda for our for last month but it was discovered that some of the notices were not actually mailed.

And so we with of course DPD's support delayed the matter until this month so the notices could be mailed. And DPD has produced to me the list that was mailed to. They are confident that mailing was in fact accomplished.

So this matter is now before this matter is now before the committee. This is a rezoning that is the outcome of a series of negotiations with landmarks, Department of Planning, and a developer who had a pretty rocky experience in as our community did in a project in Old Town. This is the site of a banquet hall that may be a former florist and banquet hall that some of you may have been to called O'New Leaf.

Some buildings that were next to it and a former stable from the late 1800s which was part of the landmark district. As part of this the Landmark Commission approved decommissioning that old stable as a contributing building to the Old Town triangle which was a traumatic experience for me in our community. It never happened and approved an addition to that building which many including myself opposed.

As a result of that I initiated this down zoning as many of you would in an effort to try to fix the situation as best we could. As a result of that we reached a compromise which is supported by the Old Town Triangle Association and by many many members of the community. It significantly downsizes and changes the look of the addition that is going to be built to the building, preserves all the remaining buildings on site, and preserves retail on the ground floor.

So the concern that has come before you and my residents had some concern about is that because of the nature of retail today the retail spaces at the front of this development are being reduced in size to make it more rentable and there are some apartments in the back of some of the retail space. That raises a concern about what the proper zoning is. The city determined it should be a B2 which allows residential on the ground floor.

However, we are all concerned about maintaining that retail on the ground floor and so the developer has made a promise to us in writing that after certificants of occupancy are entered that they will move to down zone it so that the rest of the property is preserved. And if they don't do it of course as alderman I can. This is a very as you know this is a very common practice in order to in essence an agreed non-conformity in order to keep lots the way that they should be.

So while I'm happy to answer any questions I hope that you will support this. This project has been several years in the making and this will help bring it over the finish line in a way that will protect the community, protect our landmark district and greatly reduce the impact of a proposed change to our neighborhood. Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (1:35:03 - 1:35:30)
Thank you alderman. Any questions for alderman Smith? Alderman just a quick question.

Obviously your neighbors in Old Town were very concerned about the retail maintaining there. Obviously it's a creative use of a very large ground floor space with a residential in the back but for the purposes what what do you estimate would be the retail frontage square footage?

[Speaker 4] (1:35:32 - 1:35:40)
It's in the plans so each of the storefronts is still about a thousand well over a thousand square feet.

[Speaker 1] (1:35:40 - 1:35:52)
Okay well that's good I mean you have potentially two so you have three thousand of commercial which in a lot of communities including my own that's ample enough given the fact of way retail is reshaping itself.

[Speaker 4] (1:35:52 - 1:35:53)
So that's correct.

[Speaker 1] (1:35:53 - 1:36:03)
All right other questions? Okay no more questions. Do I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 10] (1:36:04 - 1:36:05)
So moved Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:36:05 - 1:36:10)
That is vice chair Roboius makes that motion. Any objections to his motion?

[Speaker 19] (1:36:10 - 1:36:13)
No Mr. Chairman please record me as a no.

[Speaker 1] (1:36:14 - 1:36:28)
All right okay so we have one objection. Anybody else? I see alderman Siccio Lopez his hand is up.

Siccio?

[Speaker 35] (1:36:28 - 1:37:28)
Thank you chairman. I'm sorry I've had a question in terms of the is this I just want a question for alderman Smith. Is this in this is in a landmark district right so I just my question is around and I know that we had this conversation on guidelines right.

Has there been progress in terms of the specific guidelines that we have? I know that in Pilsen that was a very contested issue so in terms of the guidelines and how the guidelines can be developed you know with the neighbors because I think that's what I think some of the challenges we see right and that's what I think in our community you know having these guidelines developed with neighbors and also making sure that they're consistent. So my question is in terms of these guidelines have you know how long has gone and I know this is a you know a citywide nationwide issue but how can we work with the neighbors to ensure that there's consistency in these guidelines or what progress has it been because that flexibility can go you know both ways.

[Speaker 4] (1:37:28 - 1:39:24)
Both ways. I completely agree with you on Sancho Lopez and I think one thing that what we learned through this experience is that the old town triangle being one of the first districts ever named in the city did not benefit from the level of specificity that you can have in districts today. So today if there's a landmark district generally there'll be a list of every building poured over by landmarks in which the buildings are designated as contributing or not contributing.

It wasn't done that way in the mid-70s when Old Town was designated which led some room for for disputing whether a particular building was contributed or not contributing even though the neighbors in their in their great energy actually put some of these buildings and put put almost all the buildings on the national register. So it really was a very technical issue that I think can be avoided in today's landmark designations. In addition however because of this situation there's a project going on a mutual project with landmarks and with the community to essentially update the district.

It hasn't been updated since the 70s. Many many many buildings have been restored. Many buildings whose so therefore they have been restored properly through landmark guidance and I think that's a very important thing for the communities for communities to do which is to not only designate their districts but to to keep on top of them through a community committee and you know the old town triangle is you is is really a model for the rest of the city and how they are concerned and and police the landmark district. So thank you for that question.

[Speaker 1] (1:39:25 - 1:40:17)
Thank you both. Alderman Roboius renews his motion to move to pass by the same roll call that you determined quorum with the exception of Alderman Hopkins voting no. All those in favor?

Aye. Hearing no other objections I'm sorry hearing no other objections the item is is passed with the note of Alderman Hopkins voting no. All right um middle of page one document number a 8642 in the 32nd ward ordinance was referred on April 21st of 2021.

Common address is 3232 West Altgeld. Change request RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to an RS3 residential single unit detached house district. Alderman Waisbach.

[Speaker 2] (1:40:17 - 1:40:19)
Thanks chairman can you hear me okay?

[Speaker 1] (1:40:19 - 1:40:19)
Yep.

[Speaker 2] (1:40:20 - 1:41:23)
All right got that fixed um yes this is a an aldermanic change uh this property was rezoned about 10 years ago in an area that was from the former alderman during pre-redistricting um we are trying to through just uh purposes of planning trying to bring it in compliance with all of the properties around it which are RS3 and um I think there was one letter of objection that the uh attorney might have sent something in saying that they did have a new development uh design there but this was formerly a garden property that um the owner had said he no longer wanted the neighborhood garden on there um and with that we moved to down zone it back to its original zoning to come in compliance so I just asked for favorable consideration by my colleagues to uh put the property back to what it was originally 10 years ago.

[Speaker 1] (1:41:24 - 1:41:33)
Thank you alderman and we have not received any objectors we actually have a one positive response from a resident received this morning.

[Speaker 39] (1:41:34 - 1:41:34)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:41:35 - 1:42:34)

Alderman Ray Lopez makes the motion. Any objections to the motion? Hearing none the item is passed.

Common address is 2010 through 2012 west 69th street and the change request rs2 residential single unit detached house district through b31 community shopping district. I would like to get a motion to defer this item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

So moved chairman. That is Alderman Ray Lopez makes that motion. Any objections?

Document number 20735 t1 46th ward ordinance was referred on May 26th of 2021. Common address is 4533 to 4535 north Clark street. Change request c12 neighborhood shopping or neighborhood commercial district to b23 neighborhood mixed-use district.

And we have Tyler Manick um on the call. Tyler.

[Speaker 20] (1:45:22 - 1:46:32)
Good morning Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record my name is Tyler Manick and Shane Banks Ken Schwartz. I'm here on behalf of the 4535 north Clark from a c12 neighborhood commercial district to a b23 neighborhood mixed-use district.

The applicant proposed to adaptively reuse the existing building as a mixed-use building containing approximately 3,400 square feet of ground floor commercial space and 24 dwelling units. The existing building is lot line to lot line has no parking. This property is a transit serve location and no parking will be provided at this development.

Prior to filing this application the applicant met with Alderman Kappelman and engaged in a series of meetings for the relevant community groups Uptown United, Clark street neighbors, and Dover street neighbors. Each of the community groups support this project and Alderman Kappelman was kind enough to give us a letter of support that should be on file. With the support of the aldermen we respectfully request this committee's favorable recommendation to rezone this property to a b23 zoning district and I'd be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (1:46:33 - 1:46:37)
Okay thank you Tyler. Alderman Kappelman.

[Speaker 35] (1:46:38 - 1:46:58)
Thank you Chairman Tunney. Tyler Manick has said it all very well so this is great reuse of a building that was vacant and it will provide much more housing that's desperately needed in the so I ask my colleagues to support this project.

[Speaker 1] (1:47:01 - 1:47:52)
Questions for the alderman? Hearing none can I get a motion move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Alderman Roboius makes that motion.

Any objections to his motion? Hearing none the item is passed. Thank you James.

Let me go back. All right we'll do Tyler and then we'll see if we can get Mr. Bukarski's back. Middle of page three document number 20736 T1 25th ward ordinance was referred on May 26th of 2021.

Common address is 2258 West 21st street. The change request b32 community shopping district to b23 neighborhood mixed use district. Tyler.

[Speaker 20] (1:47:53 - 1:49:20)
Thank you Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. Again my name is Tyler Manick of Shane Banks Kenyon Schwartz. I'm here on behalf of Pilsen Rentals LLC series 17 which owns a subject property at 2258 West 21st street.

The property is currently zoned as a b32 community shopping district. The prop the property is improved with a three-story residential building containing six dwelling units. There are two parking spaces.

There's also a transit serve location with close proximity to the western avenue bus corridor. One of the units at this property is considered non-conforming albeit existing there for as long as anyone could remember. The applicant seeks a type one zoning map amendment to make all six units conforming.

No changes are being proposed to the existing building. Prior to filing this application the owner met with the alderman and his zoning advisory board. After careful consideration of the critical housing this building has provided the community historically and the commitment to affordable rents the zoning advisory board and the alderman are in support of this application to rezone this property to a b23 neighborhood mixed use district so that the owner may establish this non-conforming unit as a legal conforming unit with the city.

With the support of the alderman I respectfully request this committee's favorable recommendation to rezone this property to a b23 zoning district and I'd be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (1:49:21 - 1:49:34)
All right um let's hear from our alderman alderman um Sicho Lopez on this application in 25. Sicho.

[Speaker 35] (1:49:35 - 1:49:46)
Thank you chairman um I we we have satisfied the the due diligence you know working with the zoning advisory board so we ask my colleagues for a favorable recommendation on this item.

[Speaker 1] (1:49:46 - 1:49:49)
All right we have alderman Ray Lopez with his hand up Raymond.

[Speaker 8] (1:49:52 - 1:50:05)
The other Lopez has a question um was this purchased recently and that's why they're trying to do this? No um my client has owned it uh.

[Speaker 1] (1:50:06 - 1:50:09)
Tyler just reintroduce yourself and answer the question.

[Speaker 20] (1:50:09 - 1:50:28)
Sorry uh for the record Tyler Manick attorney for the applicant my client has owned this for some time we went into permit to the apply for a building permit to do some upkeep maintenance and that's when the non-conforming unit was identified to him.

[Speaker 8] (1:50:29 - 1:50:45)
But that non-conforming unit was already in existence when he bought it however many years ago? Correct. So however many years ago when he purchased it would there have been a certificate of zoning or is that something that was before that time?

[Speaker 20] (1:50:47 - 1:50:55)
They don't have a certificate the certificate of zoning I believe is for four units or less so if you're buying a six unit building you wouldn't get one.

[Speaker 1] (1:50:57 - 1:52:03)
Okay thank you. Thank you alderman um I don't see any other hands up I need a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. So moved chairman Alderman Alderman Raymond Lopez makes the motion any objection to the motion?

Hearing none the item's passed. All right I'm gonna try it again I'm gonna go back to the 49th ward on page one. Uh let's start let's get a test run Mr. Borkarski are you there?

Mr. Borkarski Jr. are you there? I nominate Ariel to stand in as Mr. Borkarski. All right we heard he was back but we'll give it a more time.

Okay we need to move on um and then I'm going to ask my vice chair to uh take the chair as it's this item is in the 44th ward.

[Speaker 10] (1:52:04 - 1:52:58)
Um Ariel thank you on the bottom of bottom of page three. Thank you Mr. Chairman and thank you Alderman Lopez for requesting that but maybe in a few years. Um item number the file number 20695 in the 44th ward the address commonly known as 1225-35 west on school street.

Change request plan development number 1463 to an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district. Our attorney I believe is Thomas Moore. Are you on Tom Moore?

All right he is on. There you go. Go ahead Mr. Moore.

[Speaker 5] (1:52:59 - 1:53:29)
Thank you very much uh uh Mr. Acting Chairman and uh members of the committee. Uh my name is Tom Moore for the record. This is a um uh 41,000 uh square foot project that's been a um a business manufacturing business in the 44th ward for multi-generational for the last uh 60 years or so.

[Speaker 1] (1:53:32 - 1:53:39)
Mr. Moore continue. I I hear we we finally have resurrected Mr. Borkarski but we'll wait to get through this application.

[Speaker 5] (1:53:39 - 1:55:19)
Thank you and uh so the Blackledge family has uh for two generations been an employer and a vibrant member of the community. They for instance um donated part of their property for the Cubs Park um a public park across the street on school street and they finally are at the point where uh the business was no longer viable at this location and so they closed their business. They had a buyer who was going to build 28 townhouses but after a plan development was approved that buyer backed out and that deal fell apart.

So the purpose today is to bring the property back to where it historically has been or is consistent with the surrounding properties. The property does need some environmental work and the plan the hope for plan now going forward and which I believe the alderman is insisting upon is it'll be divided into single family lots but right now all we're doing there is no plan right now. All we're doing is uh bringing it from the plan development back to an RT4 uh consistent with the surrounding property and uh the um alderman is in support of doing this so that the property can be properly developed on a going forward basis after it is environmentally cleaned.

[Speaker 10] (1:55:21 - 1:55:25)
Thank you Tom Moore. I believe uh chairman Tunney would like to speak on the matter before us.

[Speaker 1] (1:55:26 - 1:56:54)
Thank you vice chair um this project has uh been in the works for a number of years as Mr. Moore said originally we had approved uh 28 town homes um a couple years ago and the project financially fell through and so um we have a new developer uh that will actually uh have less impact than the 28 houses where they're committed to building I think the 12 single family homes on the site that uh three on Melrose and I think nine on the school street side that abuts Margaridonio park which was an amazing project we worked with the cubs on and expanded it by about 33 percent with the donation of the craftsman plating uh family to make this an even larger and more exciting park so uh this is unfortunately we're losing a manufacturing site probably one of the last ones in the 44th ward but uh they have always been a good neighbor and we want to help them get this back onto the roll so to speak and environmentally cleaned up and uh while we haven't necessarily done a second community process this project is much less intensive than what was previously approved uh by the planning commission so I'd ask my colleagues to support me on this um this I think an exciting single family home development

[Speaker 10] (1:56:55 - 1:57:53)
thank you chairman Tony are there any questions or any any comments by members of the zoning committee there are no questions uh Alderman Villegas makes a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum all in favor all opposed in the opinion of the ayes have it you're up again Ariel chairman do you want to continue in the 44th since we're still there yes sir okie dokie all right our next item uh on the file is file number 207 20-t1 for the address commonly known as 1138 west Belmont avenue the change request is a b3-2 community shopping district for b3-3 community shopping district we still have attorney tom moore to present on this matter thank you mr chairman and members

[Speaker 5] (1:57:53 - 1:58:48)
of the committee this is a project to create a mixed use development with 33 dwelling units 16 parking spots and a commercial space on Belmont avenue it is a tod transit served location and will take certain advantages of that of the transit transit served enhancements and it's been through an extensive community plan it started out with 40 units and the alderman had several meetings there were several community meetings and this plan now resulted from that process um i believe the alderman's in support and we'd ask for your

[Speaker 10] (1:58:48 - 1:59:01)
support as well thank you council we have chairman tony to speak on the matter before us thank you vice chair and committee members uh you might have seen this uh just in the last week or

[Speaker 1] (1:59:01 - 2:00:06)
so the closing of the tandem bomb hardware store i think they said 78 years of business on Belmont and this has been a generational um business and they've decided that they don't want to work as hard as their parents and grandparents um and uh their real estate's probably more valuable than the retail but that being said i went through an exhaustive process as a tod development the unique thing about this about this building is there's no alley uh there's an alley only on the western portion of it and the northern portion is uh right up next to residential so we work very closely with the not only the neighborhood organization but the immediate neighbors some resolution on height and setbacks um abutting the residential we've come to an agreement um it's a smaller plan but i think it's still a robust plan and uh has met with the community support and has my support thank you thank you chairman i i chairman i had an account

[Speaker 10] (2:00:06 - 2:00:38)
there when i used to live in the neighborhood yeah i still do a long time ago um any uh questions or comments by any members of the zoning committee if there are no questions alderman burnett makes a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine a quorum all in favor all opposed in opinion chairs the ayes have it uh the item will pass all right chairman i believe there's a sighting of a pekarski somewhere and you might be able to

[Speaker 1] (2:04:32 - 2:05:41)
woman hadn't you're comfortable with that correct yes yep thank you for catching that honor okay all right so do we need to we need to amend it no um it's just wrong on the application but it's correct on the ordinance okay so the ordinance is correct we will not need to get a substitute all right so with that clarified um get a motion to move do pass by the same almost mr chairman that is uh vice chair roboius makes the motion move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum any objections to the motion hearing none the items passed mr perkarski you're still with us i am all right i love your enthusiasm we're gonna move on to page two uh item number 20717 34th ward ordinance referred to on may 26th of 2021 common address is 1 through 13 west 103rd street so i would assume that's iron third and state change request b11 neighborhood shopping district to a c21 made a motor vehicle related commercial

[Speaker 26] (2:05:41 - 2:06:22)
district uh mr perkarski this is the southwest corner of 103rd street and state uh we are seeking uh to uh put a new gas station at this location uh we have uh the support of alderman austin i believe alderman austin might even still be on the uh uh meeting um this uh will be a significant improvement uh as a gas station and a mini mart which is desperately needed uh as a

[Speaker 1] (2:06:22 - 2:06:32)
convenience store all right um first of all we're going to hear from um other woman

[Speaker 18] (2:06:33 - 2:07:44)
perry austin it's in the 34th ward perry uh thank you mr chairman uh thank you mr perkarski you're absolutely right there will be an added resource to that end of the ward but there haven't been any activities on the west side of 103rd and state street and we're hoping that this venue will be one that the community will uh be able to enjoy even though that there are other gas stations uh in the vicinity we're hoping that this one will bring a better light than the other ones have done uh throughout the years that have passed you start out a good uh owner and then somehow another you turn but we're hoping that this doesn't happen with ours and maybe it will bring some light to the other side as well which is on the ninth ward side with and i don't believe in sides like that when we border by a street because it's about the community not about a side of the ward but i'm hoping that my colleagues will give a favorable recommendations for this particular site thank you all the woman i see alderman beal has his hand up

[Speaker 6] (2:07:44 - 2:12:29)
alderman beal good afternoon mr chairman members of the committee um you know i have some reservations as it relates to this zoning change and i articulated some of those reservations to alderman alston this morning um the there the four corners of 103rd and state street uh three of the corners are in the ninth ward in that one corner um that the proposed gas station is in the 34th ward and i've actually pulled some some data as it relates to half a half a mile radius of 103rd and state street from the police department and we have 41 registered gun offenders in that half mile radius since 2019 we have shut down three stores just to the north of this particular gas station and since 2019 there has been a decrease in shot spotter alerts and shootings in that particular area after those businesses have been closed in that immediate area were shut down in 2019 there were um over i'm trying to get my numbers right um well let me just back up let me back up to my january through june 21st and june 21st through december 31st numbers in 2016 in that half mile radius we had nine homicides in 2016 um and also in 2017 there were a total of five homicides in that half mile radius in 2018 there were 11 homicides in that area and since those three stores have been closed down in 2019 we have had five homicides in 2019 2020 there were three homicides and so far this year there have only been one homicide so we have a downward trend in that particular area as far as homicides because we were able to attribute some some resources to close those three stores down let me also give you some calls to service in that particular area from january to june let's go to 2017 that was 2700 calls for service in that half mile radius in 2018 there were another 2700 calls in that particular area in 2019 there were 2800 calls in that particular area 2020 3400 calls for service and in 2021 there was 3100 calls of service and again that's only from january to june 21st now from june 21st to june to december 31st in that particular area we had 2600 calls for service in 2016 2017 3200 calls for service in 2018 3300 calls for service in 2019 4100 calls for service in 2020 there were 3900 calls for service so it just goes to show that we have problems in that area mr chairman and that is also the area in which i'm trying to locate my cop house because of the data attributed to that particular area so you know i really just implore my colleague to rethink this particular zoning change to put a gas station there there's a gas station just a few blocks to the west and you know there's another couple of gas stations a few blocks to the to the south and it's just adding more problems to the area with a adding a gas station i don't think it's a very good idea at this particular time and if you all remember just a few months ago we had an 11 year old that was shot and killed at a gas station on 127th street and i believe this is the same owner that is trying to put this gas station on 103rd and so i just want this committee to rethink this maybe we need to just put a pause and i just implore on my colleague alderman austin to hit the pause button on this and pull it back and let's rethink putting a gas station at this area and so the police department is not in favor of it because they don't have the resources and they know that this will be a problem as well so i i just implore my colleague to pull it back thank

[Speaker 1] (2:12:29 - 2:12:43)
you alderman um i i know we've heard from alderman carrie austin we have a letter of support you're going here for me again i didn't i didn't i knew that you wouldn't be uh silent on it but i didn't

[Speaker 18] (2:12:43 - 2:14:15)
see your hand up but uh i don't need to see a hand up when i'm hearing your voice carrie uh thank you mr chairman uh uh to my colleague alderman bill yes he did speak to me very briefly in regards to this uh item uh this morning i'm just saddened that uh you have not found an opportunity to talk to me before now uh because i don't try to hide any any projects that i try to bring to the ward but it just behooves me that you want to speak on the item that i'm bringing on a corner that has had nothing on it but you didn't have an opportunity to speak to me when you brought all of the projects on your side as i said i don't believe in a your side of my side i believe that it's one street but when you did the project on a hundred and third and wet work you didn't speak to me at all and any projects that you have on your side you never speak to me in regards to it i don't think that i would hide anything from you over whatever it is that i'm doing but with all of the data that you just spoke of the police department haven't spoken to me and it's on my side my project but even with that uh with all of the data that you just spoke of here it is an individual still would like to anchor in our ward and i think that it should not be held up just because of the data that you just spoke of because there's violence everywhere not just on that end but all over the far south side and the city of chicago and i hope that my colleagues will take my advice

[Speaker 1] (2:14:15 - 2:15:35)

and i. because they're both involved in this we incorporated their comments into our plan we originally had one meeting with the 41st ward advisory council they then asked us to go back to starbucks uh to redo the plan which we did starbucks actually this plan that's being that was presented was a prototype plan first one of this type of design in the city of chicago essentially the changes were to alleviate some of the congestion to the drive-thru they also incorporated you could go on your app and order your coffee they would come out you would then not go through the drive-thru area you park they would bring the your order to you at your parking spaces or you could pull up adjacent to the property and go to a window where they could serve you there and of course lastly and this was a kind of a requisite from the community and from the 41st advisory board to have this as a sit-down restaurant we had the second meeting with the advisory board we did get a favorable vote from that body and we believe we have support of there's a letter of support from alderman napolitano i'm prepared to answer any questions that anyone has all right uh i know

[Speaker 1] (2:32:51 - 2:32:58)
to me is that the license lapsed but the use is the same that's correct alderman and actually

[Speaker 3] (2:32:58 - 2:33:04)
the building is already set up uh for for the manufacturing use all the equipment is in place so

[Speaker 1] (2:33:05 - 2:35:06)
same owner same owner agnes same same owner yes yes yes okay thank you any other questions or comments if not can i get a motion move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum so move all the cardinal move all the cardona moves do pass any objections to the motion hearing on the item is passed all right we're on the middle of page six uh i'm gonna need a motion to defer this item but let me read it into the record it's uh item number 20733 27th ward ordinance was referred on may 26th of 2021 common address 20 29 west washington boulevard the change request rt4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to an rm 4.5 residential multi-unit district and i believe this deferral is for the attorney agnes is that correct you need to unmute yourself agnes agnes you want to hear me now we can hear you yes yes mr chairman that is correct okay so uh the attorney asked for the deferral can i get a motion to defer by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum alderman viegas moves that motion any objections to the motion hearing none the item is deferred now we're on the bottom of page six document number 20731 in the 11th ward ordinance was referred on may 26th of 2021 common address is 2017 south ruble street and the change request rt4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to an rm 4.5 residential multi-unit district uh agnes once again for the record my name is

[Speaker 3] (2:35:06 - 2:35:58)
agnes black i'm an attorney with law office of mark pukat and associates located 77 west west washington chicago and i am here on behalf of the applicant tate chen who is the owner of subject property located at 2017 south ruble street and the applicant is seeking a zoning change from an rt4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to an rm 4.5 residential multi-unit district and mr chairman housekeeping matter the applicant is asking that this application is amended to a type 1 zoning change i did submit a type 1 narrative and plans to dpd um i wasn't able to confirm with anna that she received my package i'm hoping she can confirm it now but we do ask to proceed as a type 1 application with plans attached to the ordinance

[Speaker 1] (2:35:58 - 2:36:07)
all right anna you can confirm that but according to our committee we do have the amended application that we would need to put in the record as a type 1

[Speaker 21] (2:36:08 - 2:36:28)
is that correct chairman yes that is correct i did receive the okay um substitute or not substitute amended to be a type 1 this morning and was notified via email that uh that was a decision made by the alderman all right so alderman roboius moves to

[Speaker 1] (2:36:28 - 2:36:55)
amend the application to a type 1 application by the same roll call that was used to determine form any objections to the motion alderman lopez any other objections to the motion other than alderman lopez hearing none the item is passed to a type 1 application with the note of alderman lopez voting in the negative all right so the type 1 application is in front of us um and

[Speaker 3] (2:36:56 - 2:37:47)
and uh you should continue so ordinarily in an rp4 district when you have a standard lot such lot can be improved with a three-unit building by right this is a unique property if it is currently vacant substandard lot with the lot width of only 24 feet and lot deck of only 100 feet so because of the substandard depth and width the applicant needs to comply with that excuse me minimum lot area per unit requirements in order to build a new three-story residential building with three dwelling units the building will still retain an rt4 height of maximum of period we have worked with alderman thompson to explain this project we had a large community meeting very well attended uh the community was supportive of this rezoning and

[Speaker 1] (2:37:51 - 2:38:11)
the committee on the amended ordinance um i just have a quick question uh agnes will you read uh redefine what is the size of the lot please 24 2400 square feet no but the length and width

[Speaker 3] (2:38:11 - 2:38:20)
it was like a 20 that the width is 24 feet and the length is 100 feet okay and the only reason

[Speaker 1] (2:38:20 - 2:38:25)
i asked that is i'm assuming you're still doing a one-for-one parking that is correct three parking

[Speaker 3] (2:38:25 - 2:38:34)
spaces okay that was just that was my question yes thank you any other questions um then can i

[Speaker 1] (2:38:34 - 2:38:58)
get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum alderman hopkins so moves alderman hopkins makes the motion any objections to the motion hearing on the item is passed as amended as amended to type one all right uh mr chairman a brief point of order yes uh alderman hopkins on a point of order i had lost my uh connectivity

[Speaker 19] (2:38:58 - 2:39:27)
signal for about 30 minutes i was not present in the meeting so if i may just inquire during that time uh did we deal with the matter at 11 38 west belmont in your ward we did okay and that passed it did all right uh if you'll just allow me just to state my strong support for it on the record i'm sorry i wasn't present during the meeting but uh it's a great program and i commend you and the community uh and the family i'm a regular customer at the store and i'll miss the

[Speaker 1] (2:39:27 - 2:39:52)
store uh but it's the right thing to do so thank you i figured you like ariel and my were customers and you know we we all know how important it was to the community so but unfortunately as you know brian the independent hardware stores have been losing out uh for many many years with the big box so unfortunately it's a lot of work for a small business to be uh competitive well

[Speaker 19] (2:39:52 - 2:39:58)
since i uh since i bought my home i spent as much money as i could at this i tried to help

[Speaker 1] (2:39:58 - 2:40:29)
uh i'm sorry it wasn't enough all right thank you uh let me see we're on top page seven okay so top of page seven document number 20732 t1 in the first ward ordinance was referred on may 26th of 2021 this address 1945 north california avenue and the change request b31 community shopping district to be 23 neighborhood mixed-use district uh agnes are you still with us i'm i'm

[Speaker 3] (2:40:29 - 2:41:32)
here um again for the record my name is agnes black i'm an attorney with the office of mark kubiak and associates located at 77 west washington street chicago and i'm here on behalf of the applicant andrew maxwell who is the owner of the subject property located at 1945 north california avenue and this is sort of a unique situation uh the subject property is currently improved with a non-conforming residential building with three dwelling units uh the applicant has purchased it back in 2012 as a three-blood with a uh with a zoning certification also certifying three dwelling units so we are here today just to sort of legalize the existing conditions uh another housekeeping matter uh mr chairman um i did submit a substitute um type one plans and type one uh narrative we did not have any substantive changes to the plans but we did have some formatting changes so that's the reason for the substitute so i would ask to proceed on the

[Speaker 1] (2:41:32 - 2:42:04)
substitute uh plans and narrative all right alderman cardona moves to accept the substantive narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum any objections to that alderman lopez alderman lopez again is objecting um any others objections hearing no other uh objections the substantive narrative plans are accepted and i know you you basically said agnes that there wasn't what is the difference between the

[Speaker 3] (2:42:04 - 2:42:24)
substitute and there's this was just as i was talking to dpd they asked me to um do some formatting changes to just make it a little bit more legible for publishing so just just the formatting changes no no changes to all plans to the sections of the plans right so if if my memory

[Speaker 1] (2:42:24 - 2:42:31)
is listing to you is correct the owner has owned the property since 2012 he had a zoning certificate

[Speaker 3] (2:42:31 - 2:42:44)
for three units that's right at the time of his purchase yes and recently um when he applied for a new zoning certification in connection with his family sale dpd determined that the prior zoning

[Speaker 1] (2:42:44 - 2:43:03)
cert was issued in error so oh that's new information to me then that's what i wanted to hear all right well we're not going to hear from the department on this but at this point unless they want to opine but i do have uh alvin waguespec on this one yes chairman just a quick

[Speaker 2] (2:43:03 - 2:43:18)
question uh one question on this one is this one uh right off the alley miss pleca okay i know which one it is all right thank you all right chairman alderman uh ray lopez raymond thank you chairman

[Speaker 8] (2:43:18 - 2:43:43)
actually i'd like the department to answer that question because that is something that has been discussed routinely by this body about these certificates of zoning when people buy properties thinking they have a three unit only find out they have a two unit um what recourse individual have when the department let's hear from the department on this one uh who would like patrick

[Speaker 21] (2:43:47 - 2:44:24)
patrick and anna anna robles here um from what i understand chairman is uh the zoning certificates are valid for one year i don't know the date that that particular certificate was issued but over the years things change uh errors occur when they didn't find previous records in order to correct the records issue a new certificate per ownership let me go let me step back for a second

[Speaker 1] (2:44:24 - 2:45:08)
as alderman lopez is concerned we all witness zoning asserts that well they don't have a zoning certificate usually for the net for the number that they want and in this case they have what they want but you're saying that a zoning cert only is valid for a year correct and does that mean that they have to renew it periodically or when they're ready to sell it when they're ready to sell it all right so i have another department uh steve you want to yes uh so um there have been

[Speaker 30] (2:45:08 - 2:45:14)
over the years there's been some errors we issue more than 20 wait wait a second steven you're

[Speaker 1] (2:45:14 - 2:45:19)
telling me the department makes some errors yeah yes okay make that i want to make sure that's on

[Speaker 30] (2:45:19 - 2:45:59)
the record there yes yes all right all right we do over uh there are over 22 000 zoning certs a year that are issued so of course there's going to be some errors the zoning cert is there to protect the buyer uh because we're making sure that there's a permit and that the the uh unit was lawfully established it meets the building code so there's not any issues with their electrical or their plumbing or any other things so there's been over the years there's been a lot of illegal units that have been put into these buildings now like i said we do from time to time make an error but the vast majority of them we do not and we we need to correct our errors and that's what we're here to

[Speaker 1] (2:45:59 - 2:46:06)
do today all right good enough um i thought you guys were perfect over there i'm sorry well

[Speaker 8] (2:46:06 - 2:47:09)
some of some of us are all asleep all right is that all vice chair roboius well chairman chairman i actually would like to have a follow-up if i may with that all right let's go back to raymond and then we'll go to ariel so forgive me vice chairman and as shocking as it is to learn that zoning makes errors um steve i just want to say one thing though in this case they received something that matched their property so now you did protect the buyer when they purchased the property buying three flats saying a three unit building saying it was a three unit building um but now having that protection trying to move forward with it now they're getting shafted basically so i'm trying to figure out and kind of understand when you did it right in the front end but on the back end we're having issues how do we rectify that without having individuals no offense to mr klupiak or any other lawyer without having to purchase a get legal representation to fix the error that we

[Speaker 30] (2:47:09 - 2:48:03)
as a department created for them well in some cases they're um they're they're capable they're able to do it through an administrative adjustment they're able to correct the error through an adjustment uh which does not require um you to obtain an attorney uh it's a simpler process notifying the alderman and the neighbors and still getting a uh a permit uh for the work that is there is in place but that is another avenue that can in some cases can be used so you know i understand i understand uh your frustration and and residents frustration but at the same time we need to correct our errors when we find them that's because we're following what the law says

[Speaker 10] (2:48:05 - 2:49:08)
that's the best explanation i can give you okay vice chair rob boyas uh thank thank you chairman uh i i um and i understand what the alderman lopez is saying but i also um i'm uh very uh supportive of the way the zoning uh handles some of these issues and you know we're here to help our constituents and i understand where alderman lopez is coming from but i think the best and the most inexpensive proposition that the property owner may have is to pull some permits you know and and just get the job done and less costly but but if nothing else uh we work you know i i work with the zoning uh folks and uh they've been very helpful i mean it's not 100 all the time but uh but they they're very helpful thank you chairman thank you all

[Speaker 21] (2:49:08 - 2:49:37)
right um anna are you gonna have the final word on this or did you i just wanted to state that um that lot in particular was downsized it was created at a 2400 square foot lot they sold off a portion of the rear yard so i don't know exactly when that occurred but things have changed so this particular project was looked or reviewed thoroughly prior to denying yet certificate

[Speaker 3] (2:49:38 - 2:50:23)
right all righty okay enough said do we uh yes agnes mr chairman agnes pleca um again for the record uh attorney for the applicant uh two comments that i just was hoping to clarify number one um this particular original uh zoning certificate was was obtained uh nine years ago when when the applicant purchased the property uh we were not involved in the purchase of that property back then so we were just uh helping them clarify the situation now so that's the broad and number two more importantly on the record i do think that the zoning department is perfect and i have absolutely no critique and i always find them very very helpful so i just

[Speaker 1] (2:50:23 - 2:51:39)
wanted to clarify that okay well good um i know you're in front of them all the time so it's nice to praise in public so we might not feel the same way sometimes about our about our planning department but by and large we're very we're very happy with uh steve and the team but as as we learn through some of this to realize there are 22 000 certificates you know on an annual basis you know there's there's going to be a little bit of mix-up but i think they do a great job so thank you for that um no more comments or questions if not i'd like to get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine forum alderman uh roboius moves do pass any objections to his motion hearing on the item is passed with the substantive narrative and plans middle of page seven uh document number 20689 t1 in the 27th ward ordinance was referred on april 21st of 21 common address is 615 north ogden avenue change request m12 limited manufacturing business park district to b25 neighborhood mixed use district uh agnes you're still up

[Speaker 7] (2:54:24 - 2:58:03)
um warren silver of silver law office pc uh with offices at 1700 west irving park road uh we are here representing trim tab llc um and its uh owner uh brian zucker is uh on the call um we're looking for a zoning map amendment to change the district from the b12 to the b15 uh for the purpose of uh rehabbing an existing uh non-conforming building uh it's a three-story building that's uh being used for like manufacturing warehouse a spice business on the first floor on that grade and uh there are six dwelling units above um the purpose of the rezoning is to uh repurpose the building as the corporate headquarters for human capital research corporation uh human capital is a consulting business that provides data-driven insights and strategy to uh executives and educational institutions mostly colleges and universities um and they're looking to bring 35 jobs in from the suburbs uh to uh this area of lakeview uh the they plan to expand uh to as many as 45 jobs over the next few years um the human capital would occupy the ground floor the basement the second floor a portion of the third floor um and the remainder of the third floor uh would be a residence for mr zucker who uh is also the uh chief executive of human capital research corporation and so the applicant here is a special entity uh holding the real estate for human capital because the building is so much larger than the current zoning district uh the need to increase the floor area by about 712 square feet out of a total existing of 20,536 so the total after would be 21,248 it's less than a 3.5 increase and the purpose of that is to add an elevator penthouse and a stairwell penthouse uh so that the roof is accessible there's a small roof deck up there now that would that's not accessible and that would be improved as part of the rehab of the building um but because we're increasing ever so slightly the floor area of this non-conforming building we do need to change the zoning uh to accommodate that uh the uh the site already has two parking spaces on it um only one is required for the dwelling unit none are required for this office use um based on the floor area of the office um we have had extensive community process uh meetings with south lakeview neighbors as well as the lakeview roscoe village chamber of commerce uh they're in support of the project uh and i understand that alderman weggis back uh has sent a a letter indicating that he doesn't object uh to the committee and he's on the call if he has anything you'd like to add to that uh at this point if uh

[Speaker 1] (2:58:03 - 2:58:18)
anyone has any questions welcome them thank you thank you mr silver alderman wagus back scott do you want to comment on lincoln avenue yeah can you hear me on this one

[Speaker 2] (2:58:18 - 2:58:52)
a little echoey but yes we can hear you yeah chairman uh sorry about that this audio is really bad but um just for purposes of planning we do support this change met with many of the organizations and um this is a non-conforming uh building but it would bring uh opportunity for a lot more jobs to that strip there that you know pretty well so i would just ask for my colleagues favorable consideration uh on a motion to pass thank you alderman questions from committee

[Speaker 1] (2:58:52 - 2:59:11)
members um alderman i i know this intersection very well um was that i'm sorry i didn't hear maybe mr silver can answer this but it's it went from it's from a b12 why did why was a b13 not

[Speaker 7] (2:59:11 - 2:59:40)
applicable could you restate that so a a couple of things first of all the building uh was still too large for a b13 um and and to uh allow the existing floor area to be um conforming we needed to go to b15 i also want to add that this is a type one uh rezoning amendment um there weren't changes to the narrative or plans that were submitted upon filing of the application

[Speaker 1] (2:59:40 - 3:00:58)
so there's no substitute okay um so on one end you say that the square footage was um too not big enough for a three yeah the existing okay exceeds the three um but also you're also saying that there's no parking required because it wasn't it was under that threshold so correct me if i'm wrong i mean at one end after a certain amount of square footage it may because it's a five um that that there would be a requirement if it was a b13 let's say so i i see i see you talking on both ends of this one so i i can the department help me on this one the fact that there's okay yes there's no parking but yet it's and i understand under a five it would have no parking but he was saying that the building is big enough that it needed a five but if it was a three i mean what is the threshold for parking on the commercial

[Speaker 24] (3:00:59 - 3:01:08)
except under a five is well it's based on the size so i i guess warren yeah of the bit

[Speaker 7] (3:01:09 - 3:01:33)
i i just did in the ordinance um uh under 17 10 uh 207 l uh office uses in the um l and uh in the dash five uh no parking is required for the first 35 000 square feet of office use right there would be one parking space required for the single dwelling unit i get that

[Speaker 12] (3:01:34 - 3:01:48)
um and there are 10 10 chairman i think you're asking about the you're asking about the exemption that if they were in the three right so that for the first 10 000 square feet there's an

[Speaker 30] (3:01:48 - 3:01:56)
exemption in the dash three that's that's zero parking okay correct so that by going to the five

[Speaker 1] (3:01:56 - 3:02:34)
their exemption increases to 30 some thousand yes sir 35 well again it's a little technical but i i you know i know that you're bringing 35 employees and maybe more uh without any parking um and i know parking is it is at a premium over there so i'm sure it's going to be i'm sure it's vetted through the community with this and i know it's going to be an exciting project um but you know when i look at fives it says no parking but then i understand around you know that you know they needed some parking but in this case with the five and the size of the building there's only

[Speaker 7] (3:02:34 - 3:03:04)
one parking space required for the residential right yeah and uh let me just add that uh uh yeah the required parking would be the single space two are provided uh the building is uh within uh the appropriate distance from uh the long haul bus corridor along ashland avenue uh it's also an area that's otherwise very transit rich um all right i appreciate it i think i think we've exhausted

[Speaker 1] (3:03:04 - 3:05:03)
my question on that so okay i get it thanks warren any other questions if not can i get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine form alderman cardona makes that motion any objections to his motion hearing none uh the item is passed thank you warren good chatting with you uh top of page eight uh document number 20713 30th ward ordinance was referred on may 26th of 21 common address is 3339 north bridgeway avenue uh change request rs3 residential single unit detached house district to an rm 4.5 residential multi-unit district um i do have an item um i've heard this item is will need to be deferred by the attorney um do i hear a motion to defer this item by the same roll call that was used to determine form uh the move alderman lopez alderman ray lopez makes the motion any objections hearing none the item is deferred um ariel uh you you get that one ariel we have to defer it based on the attorney okay great all right middle of page eight document number 20724 t1 27th ward ordinance was deferred on may 26th of 21 common address is 2655 west monroe street and the change request yeah uh ariel that was the previous one that's deferred by the attorney sarah barnes all right moving on again 27th ward 2655 west monroe street change request m12 limited manufacturing business park district to an rm5 residential multi-unit district

um and may and may the 18th 2016 the chicago city council approved plan development 1323 for to construct in sub area a 73 story building with 832 feet tall with 506 dwelling units and 486 parking spaces uh which was then later reduced to 440 parking spaces uh sub area b remain the same at which is a property at 1006 south michigan that's improved with an existing eight-story building 102 feet tall that remains the same what we're doing with this and what's before you today we're seeking to amend pd 13 13 23 and to add 232 units to sub area a and reduce the height by 800 to from 832 feet down to 805 feet and to reduce the parking to 325 spaces taking advantage of the transit served location a parking reduction with an far of 27.94 for sub area a we have conducted uh well the applicant is seeking to take the 0.5 far neighborhood bonus which would result in a payment of 407 316 dollars the applicant has agreed this is an this is matter as before in alderman king's award the applicant has agreed to an mbe participation goal of 29 for mbe and six percent for wbe we increased the amount of the requirement for the mbe from 26 to 29 the proposed amendment triggered an additional aro from 506 to 738 and so we originally paid 800 802 thousand five hundred two thousand dollars for the original bonus and now we're all these additional 23 units that we're going to be providing will be built in on site the construction cost of the project is 430 million dollars creating 2379 temporary jobs 26 permanent jobs the increase in real estate taxes goes from 150 000 a year to five million dollars for meeting the sustainable policy we met with alderman king a number of times on this we had two community meetings on this matter in her ward we also met with the near south planning board where i made a presentation to them and they then issued their letter of support alderman king testified before the chicago plan commission in support of it i i don't know if she's still on the call but i hope she is and she can testify again here today we think this is a great project this was designed by helmut yan this was the last thing he did before he died and and we think it's a beautifully designed building and we think it'd be a tremendous landscape asset to the landscape of our city i'd like to give special attention and thanks to heidi sperry from dpd for all the time and effort that she put in and working with us on this project and i stand ready to mr chairman and members of the committee to answer any of the questions that you have concerning our

[Speaker 1] (3:23:41 - 3:23:58)
project i think we have uh all the other woman sophia king on this i know uh as a member of planning commission she spoke very highly of it but i think she wants to say a few words on today

[Speaker 15] (3:23:59 - 3:25:52)
all the woman king yeah thank you chairman i appreciate you allowing me uh to talk about this and um yeah we uh obviously just talked about this during the planning commission but i'd love to just um for my colleagues consideration just say a few words um you know as i said this is really an amendment to a pd um and this was approved some years ago as a slightly different plan with condominiums instead of rental units and so they're seeking an amendment the community did have some concerns however um as mr george uh just indicated we had several community meetings i believe that they earnestly addressed a lot of the concerns around parking traffic construction related concerns uh they also work with the community to make sure that there's affordable housing on site which i think is really important um as i've continued to say you know affordable housing is a responsibility of the entire city and not just a segregated few parts and so i appreciate the development team looking at putting affordable units um on the site directly uh especially on michigan avenue i think that says a lot um also increasing the mb and wb goals i appreciate that as well um and given um you know some of the uncertainty in construction i appreciate that they're moving forward as well uh this is a big project that's going to bring a lot of jobs and for that reason chairman i am asking for your yours and my colleagues support

[Speaker 1] (3:25:52 - 3:26:34)
to move this forward thank you very much thank you all the woman any questions comments um for the team or the alder woman well i i do want to congratulate your alder woman sophia king i think this was very much praised by members of the planning commission this was you know this is enthusiastically supported um my question is i'm thinking just historically uh the landmark district on south michigan avenue where does that how far south does that go down or is this building within that within that district it's within that district

[Speaker 11] (3:26:34 - 3:26:41)
mr chairman and they amended in 2016 to allow the heights to be between 400 and 900 feet so

[Speaker 1] (3:26:41 - 3:27:52)
ours falls within that district okay yep all righty thank you very much um any other questions or comments hearing none um can i get a motion to move to pass uh perdona by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum and that was the alderman cardona and any objections to his motion all right hearing none this item is passed as revised all right mr chairman and members of the commission we appreciate it bottom of page 11 is our next item and that's number 2019 5 32nd ward ordinance was referred on september 18th of 19 address common address 1838 through 1842 north elston avenue also 1839 through 1843 north beasley court um change request m33 heavy industry district to b33 community shopping district and then to residential plan development katrina mcguire good afternoon mr chairman members

[Speaker 31] (3:27:52 - 3:28:20)
of the committee katrina mcguire from thompson coburn here on behalf of the applicant uh it's nice to see everybody this afternoon uh with me today are jim jann from jab real estate as well as shawn o'gorman from pastoral associates who are the project architects this was a matter that was heard at plan commission on june 17th and we would ask that the record of the proceedings before the plan commission be incorporated in today's record wanna moves to incorporate the records from

[Speaker 1] (3:28:20 - 3:28:44)
the plan commission by the same roll call as used to determine form any objections to the motion one lopez okay any other objections hearing no other objections um we will move we'll incorporate them with alderman lopez's objection all right uh continue on katrina thank you mr chairman uh

[Speaker 31] (3:28:44 - 3:29:37)
this is a 34 unit project um that will also provide three aro units on site um that will all be uh accessible units the site is within the north branch corridor framework plan area and accordingly is subject to a hundred and thirty one thousand bonus fee for the far bonus that's being sought as well as an approximately hundred and four thousand dollar conversion fee that is set forth within that framework ordinance the developer intends to comply with the city's mbwb participation goals um we are available for any questions about the project we do have our plan commission presentation available if you would like to share it if you would like us to discuss this further um we do have a letter from alderman waxpack of no objection but i believe he is also here today and with that um i have nothing further unless there's questions um katrina you're right

[Speaker 1] (3:29:37 - 3:29:51)
we do have a letter of no objection uh from well i see his hand up now so maybe his audio is better alderman log expect you want to speak on the one on elston please hey chairman um kind of moving

[Speaker 2] (3:29:51 - 3:31:32)
around here to see if i get better wi-fi but um this this this position sounds good actually okay good i'm closer to your office actually um so we had this at plan commission as you know uh north branch works was opposed to it we did have another letter of objection from a neighboring business but i think we haven't uh spoken in a bit specifically about some of the plans for parking there but this was a good discussion at the plan commission they've made significant changes to the project what's interesting is that right across the street is lincoln yards and that was part of plan commission was that um in 2017 this area was changed um i think dpd spoke to it as well and while it is residential you know we are looking at um properties across the street that will be providing there you can see it there the lincoln yards residential so in terms of uh density and height um there's no comparison here and i think the plan commission was looking at it favorably in terms of what we were looking for with the affordable housing so i understand the objections from the groups that i've worked with there but this fits into what the plan commission voted on four years ago and uh it just it's a sort of a complex issue but one that um i think garnered the support of the plan commission and uh this committee i would just ask for a favorable consideration on

[Speaker 1] (3:31:33 - 3:32:22)
a motion to pass thank you thank you thank you alderman um and i think what's not on the slide is the uh the uh protected manufacturing district and how we amended that a number of years ago that certainly added residential as a mixed use uh and kept i think it was the southern portion of that corridor with heavy manufacturing only so i think that was pretty instructive oh you got it thanks okay so we're in i think you and i were in those meetings where the star red star is where the property is correct that's correct okay scott i'm sorry well i was just gonna say that you and

[Speaker 2] (3:32:22 - 3:32:49)
i were in meetings about 10 or 12 years ago on this area and originally looking at how it was going to change i don't think we realized that with the lincoln yards plan it would change that significantly but that change in 2017 uh opened the door for these types of projects so residential is not banned or prohibited here um and that's i think what led to this type of project so

[Speaker 1] (3:32:49 - 3:33:01)
thank you all right any other questions comments if not can i get a motion alderman uh roboius makes that motion to move do path i'm sorry

[Speaker 19] (3:33:02 - 3:33:20)
alderman hopkins before we take a vote on that i didn't see your hand brian yeah thank you mr chairman if i could just ask uh what was the source of the slide uh that showed the uh lincoln yards height uh for some of the proposed buildings on the sub areas um in that plan

[Speaker 31] (3:33:20 - 3:33:49)
development patrina sure alderman those were pulled uh shauna gorman's on the call that they prepared the slide but those were pulled from the approved plan development document for lincoln yards north and south and it also includes triangle square to the north um so those were all the the massings of the approved um potential approved developments in lincoln yards dpd asked us to put our proposed development in the context of what

[Speaker 19] (3:33:49 - 3:35:31)
is approved in the area yeah thank you i appreciate that clarification i thought i'd seen every slide that was out there for uh demonstrating what the uh plans are in long term for lincoln yards going forward and i hadn't seen that one yet so thank you for that clarification and mr chairman i would just point out that uh we constantly hear criticism for our lack of a master plan for development going forward in most community areas in the city of chicago uh and now we have one at least for the north branch you know it was uh the result of a very robust and spirited community engagement process and it's a document that reflects some decisions that were made as part of that planning process one of them certainly involves the future of this area as it evolves from an industrial area to a mixed use so it just seems inconsistent to me on the one hand to decry a lack of a plan and then when a plan is ultimately prepared uh to object to it going forward when when proposals are suggested that are in compliance with that plan uh i just i don't understand it i don't i don't understand the inconsistency there um and i i know that was uh the focus of some discussion on this particular project um which i think is a good project and i'm i'm pleased to support it um but i just wanted to point that out going forward as we talk about developing master plans for you know much of the city that isn't covered by it if we're going to do that then we have to honor it and and we have to stick to it unless we're going to amend it which is another process altogether so i will make the appropriate motion to support this at the time thank you mr

[Speaker 1] (3:35:31 - 3:35:36)
chairman thank you and i think we'll get a motion after we hear from alderman rey lopez

[Speaker 8] (3:35:38 - 3:35:50)
thank you chairman i'll just be brief i'm sure that no matter what jim jan has designed it's going to be beautiful along the river uh and look forward to seeing this once it becomes once it becomes a reality thank you

[Speaker 1] (3:35:50 - 3:36:59)
thank you alderman so um alderman uh hopkins uh makes the motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum any objections to the motion hearing none uh the again in the 32nd ward item number 20632 the ordinance was referred on february 24th of 2021 common address is 2101 through 2125 west lindale street 2200 through 2240 north point avenue 2100 through 2124 west webster avenue and 2201 through 2243 north hamilton avenue and uh the change request rt4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to an institutional residential plan development paul shadel good morning mr chairman or good

[Speaker 36] (3:36:59 - 3:37:28)
afternoon mr chairman members of the committee um paul shadel with the law firm of bla piper along with my colleague katie janky dale here representing the applicant and with me today are anthony chadid with the applicant and dan campbell with space architects available to answer any questions as you noted this is a request to rezone this property to plan development the matter was heard and recommended for approval by the planning commission on june 17th and i'd ask that the record of those proceedings be incorporated into

[Speaker 1] (3:37:28 - 3:37:47)
this record of this proceeding alderman marie had moves to incorporate the records from the planning commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum any objections to emotion hearing no objections the records are incorporated uh paul would you continue sure and

[Speaker 36] (3:37:47 - 3:38:26)
i would just note this is a this is a proposal related to the saint hedwig parish campus we're not proposing any changes to building footprints the proposed project would simply renovate an existing vacant former rectory building at the southwest corner of the site to contain 23 dwelling units three of which would be affordable um i have i could share my screen to show you the site plan if if any of the members would like to see that um but otherwise uh this is a project that we discussed in great detail with alderman waggis pack with the department of planning and the department of housing and we would respectfully request this committee's positive recommendation

[Speaker 1] (3:38:28 - 3:38:48)
uh let me just say this i know i was on planning commission i know alderman waggis pack thought it was a great reuse of it um alderman waggis pack do you want to comment on on this project sure on hamilton among other streets sure so this is uh an old church

[Speaker 2] (3:38:48 - 3:40:27)
rectory slash school um i actually had my wedding reception there going to saint hedwig so i know and i've worked in that actual um building um when i was on the parish committee there so it is built like a an old fallout shelter um back in 1909 it's going to be very difficult to do the construction but i was very happy to see this adaptive reuse and um really happy with uh the way this has turned out it was a it was difficult back and forth um with dpd but i think they did their best to make sure we got the right product and as well as mr chadid and mr shadel and uh katie janketale so um for purposes of planning on this and and putting in these affordable units i would ask for a favorable vote from my committee members thank you okay uh question i'm assuming scott the the parish is still active it just yes it is and uh it's interesting because there was just an announcement made about that renew um program for the diocese with two other churches um this pair this church will remain as the primary for services um and as you know there's a school on the other portion of the property uh cics bucktown so that will remain viable for the time being as well but this this actual piece of um the property of this building was underutilized for many decades and um the church isn't able to sustain it unless we do something else with it but it did have favorable um support from almost all the neighbors and the community group as well

[Speaker 1] (3:40:28 - 3:40:34)
what if if i if my listening is correct paul said it was the rectory building

[Speaker 36] (3:40:35 - 3:40:40)
my mistake chairman it was a convent it was a convent i made a mistake yes it was a convent

[Speaker 1] (3:40:40 - 3:40:52)
as a young catholic boy um i caught that discrepancy there and i that's why i wondered if this maybe they're maybe they're going out of business so to speak but no my mistake it was it was the convent

[Speaker 2] (3:40:52 - 3:41:03)
but it was used partially as a school and um additional housing for an occasional visiting uh priest where we didn't have room in the rectory all right any other questions comments

[Speaker 1] (3:41:05 - 3:42:10)
hearing none can i get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum alderman cardona makes the motion um any objections to the motion hearing none uh this item is passed as revised all right thank you thank you all right uh staying in the 32nd ward top of page 13 uh let me see document number 20659 t 132nd ward ordinance was referred on march 24th of 2021 this is 1628 through 58 west wolfram street and 2833 through 45 north paulina street and the change request m12 limited manufacturing business park district to an rt4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district rolando acosta so rolando

[Speaker 17] (3:42:10 - 3:42:58)
because i have already heard rolando rolando you're up um wolfram please um good afternoon mr chairman members of the committee rolando acosta here on behalf of the applicant i have two matters for you today in the 32nd ward that are across the street from one another on wolfram and paulina northeast corner and southeast corner of wolfram and paulina the first one is 20659 t1 which is the north side of wolfram and paulina immediately west of

[Speaker 1] (3:42:58 - 3:43:10)
the existing hello no i continue on you were still on the 20659 t1 yes uh so this matter

[Speaker 17] (3:43:10 - 3:43:23)
first of all i should note has a substitute ordinance substitute narrative and substitute drawings associated with it all right so i'm going to ask alderman cardona to

[Speaker 1] (3:43:23 - 3:43:34)
accept the substantive narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum any objections to his motion hearing none the substantive

[Speaker 17] (3:43:34 - 3:44:31)
narrative and plans are accepted the nature of the substitute mr chairman is that we added some property on the north approximately 10 foot strip there was a remnant and deleted some property on the east but the plan itself still remains the same which is to do 13 single family homes and what today is manufacturing zoned the reason for the addition of land on the north is that the alderman had requested that we build an alley across along that built it to cdot standards whether cdot will accept it or not is a future question and the 10 feet accommodates that so it yields effectively a 16 foot width for an alley and 125 foot lots for the 13 homes that are to be built there we went through a procedure with the south lakeview neighbors where they reviewed the proposal and voted favorably to recommend it and we are happy to answer any questions the

[Speaker 1] (3:44:31 - 3:44:44)
committee may have all right questions from the committee members i know alderman wang is back is probably wanting scott you want to speak on this one i don't know if your audio has come through

[Speaker 2] (3:44:45 - 3:44:53)
uh yeah if you if you like i can just um you know work uh why don't you talk about both questions

[Speaker 1] (3:44:53 - 3:44:56)
why don't you talk about both of them even though that i'll have to take it separately but

[Speaker 2] (3:44:57 - 3:46:24)
across the street from each other right um essentially as rolando said this is just for purposes of planning going from old manufacturing um to a single family the original plans that we saw were dozens of uh condos and that was not acceptable to most of the neighbors most of the surrounding area there is single family or um some uh i think some multi um unit buildings but um from the neighborhood group which you i think you know uh pretty well um everybody kind of came around to single family homes there there's also an issue with overcrowding at the local school there so most people were looking at that issue as well rolando mentioned the 10-foot strip this is an important thing for us we've seen some of these properties that face inwards that were built in years past that had private alleys or private streets that led to problems with us having to maintain them um and legal issues so we asked for a public alley to be built there and we're working with the neighboring property owners property owners to make sure that um you know we set that up properly so uh for both of these i would just say that um for purposes of planning and the 32nd were to ask for favorable consideration of the two items from the committee members thank you scott um any questions for the applicant

[Speaker 1] (3:46:24 - 3:46:46)
or the alderman okay um hearing none alderman uh cardona cardona moves to pass um by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum for the the yes that's right yes

[Speaker 21] (3:46:46 - 3:47:05)
yes okay so no objection to that chairman yes anna chairman this is anna robles i just want to confirm it was a amended to the substitute ordinance and the ordinance itself they amended

[Speaker 1] (3:47:05 - 3:48:57)
the ordinance that's correct okay all right so the the question before the committee is to uh pass with the substantive narrative and plans is that correct correct all right i think and substitute ordinance and the substitute ordinance so okay substantive narrative plans and the substitute ordinance correct okay any objections to that hearing none um it's passed with the substantive narrative and plans and amended ordinance all right anna tell me what i'm doing wrong please substitute ordinance and substitute narrative and plans all right so we're passed with the substantive narrative and the substitute ordinance correct anna correct all right any objections to that hearing none it's passed with the substantive narrative and the substitute ordinance oh my god okay thank you thank you thank you staff on that one all right i'll probably have to do that again on the next one so let's read in document number 20660 t 132nd ward ordinance was referred on march 24th of 21 common address 1649 through 1659 west wolfram 28 15 through 25 north alina street the change request m12 limited manufacturing business park district to rs3 residential single unit detached house district oh okay rolando it's a different uh a different

[Speaker 17] (3:48:57 - 3:50:01)
change request on the it is mr chairman good afternoon again rolando acosta here on behalf of the applicant the good news here is that there are no substitutes so we don't have to worry about that at all uh the reason for the difference this is an existing manufacturing vacant property zone manufacturing being rezoned to an rs3 to allow for the construction of five single family homes uh the reason for the different zoning district is that this particular block has a pattern of rs3 zoning on it so the alderman's office had asked us to consider that continue that pattern and follow the rs3 guidelines while the northern parcel is adjacent to a series of rt4 properties so hence the difference in the two zonings so the houses on the south would be smaller based on the rs3 designation than the houses on the north again this plan as described went before the south lakeview neighbors and for the reasons i think the alderman identified previously they were favorably disposed and in support of this project

[Speaker 1] (3:50:02 - 3:51:07)
and obviously the alderman is supportive of it do we have any questions on this application or the attorney or the alderman all right hearing no questions uh can i get a motion move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum alderman cardona makes that motion any objections to his motion hearing none the item is passed thank you all right top page 14 in the 27th ward document number 20225 ordinance was referred on october 16th of 19 common address is 200 through 218 north aberdeen 1100 through 1108 west lake street and 213 through 233 north main street also 1111 through 1125 west bolton uh let me see change request c11 neighborhood shopping neighborhood commercial district to to dx5 downtown mixed use district and then to a business plan development

mike esker good afternoon mr chairman members of the committee michael esker from the law firm of acosta esker on behalf of the applicant lg development group and as a preliminary matter this project did uh go receive uh unanimous approval at the plan commission on june 17th and i would respectfully request that that record be incorporated into this proceeding

[Speaker 1] (3:51:34 - 3:51:52)
um alderman hopkins moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum any objections to that hearing none the records are incorporated continue mike thank you uh in keeping with our the theme of

[Speaker 13] (3:51:52 - 3:52:21)
