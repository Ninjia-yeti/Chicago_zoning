[Speaker 11] (13:18 - 13:55)
Paradise is waiting for you and me Well, let's do public comment.

[Speaker 1] (13:57 - 16:53)
Okay, folks. Sorry we're running a little bit late. The February 13, 2020 Committee on Zoning, Landmarks, and Building Standards is called to order.

We are going to start this morning off with the approval of the Rule 45 report containing the minutes of the January 14, 2020 meeting of the Committee on Zoning, Landmarks, and Building Standards. Everyone should have a copy in front of them. And if you hear me, no objections.

Do I have a motion to approve the minutes? Moved by Alderman Villegas. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? Hearing no objections, the report has been approved.

All right. I've got to use my gavel. Sorry.

All right. Moving on, we will now hear the items to be deferred. I'll read the page number, the file number, the address, and lastly, the reason for deferral and take a motion for all at the end.

So we'll start in the middle of page 11, file number 20267T1, located at 1317 West Wrightwood Avenue per the Alderman. Backtrack to middle of page 6, file number 20312, located at 2551 North Milwaukee Avenue and 3061 West Logan Boulevard per the Alderman. Moving to the top of page 8, file number 20323, located at 421 through 51 North Michigan Avenue, 137 through 209 East Illinois Street, and 458 through 78 North Cityfront Plaza.

This item has not been before the plan commission. All right. Do I have any other deferrals?

No. Okay. So do I hear a motion to defer these items?

Alderman Lopez moves to defer. All in favor? Aye.

Opposed? In the opinion of Chair, the ayes have it, and these items are deferred. At this time, we will now begin the public comment period.

Out of respect for everyone's time, each speaker is limited to three minutes to address all items on the agenda, and for that matter, if they would alert us to what item you are speaking for and against, it would be greatly appreciated, as this will be the only opportunity to address the items on the agenda, and the committee will not conduct separate public comment before each agenda item. All right. So witness slips, I know.

Bring them down. Bring them to the clerk. Let's start.

Let's start with Manuel Vega. Manuel. Step up to the mic.

[Speaker 20] (17:11 - 20:04)
Good morning, Tom Toomey and committee members. I am speaking to the property rezoning on the ordinance number 20147, and this was referred 9-18-19. This is 5136 through 38 North Claremont Avenue.

In fact, the purpose of this applicant seeks to subdivide a property into two lots. That is incorrect. This lot is already two lots, and that already creates a problem.

Yes, Tom, do you need a minute? Okay. There is a restricted covenant put to order.

The multiple members of the ward's neighbors have had a chance to review that. What we oppose as a community is that this density change, an RM4.5 from an RS3, allows for a nonconforming build when compared to other homes on this residential interior street where all the buildings and homes are set back 15 feet or greater. There is a density problem here with this change.

An RM4.5 on lot 9, which is this lot, according to the drawings that have been submitted, the new drawings, will allow a build that traverses the lot line. It's a 25-foot lot. You want to build a 25-foot 10-inch building on it.

Why don't you just build a building that fits on an RS3? That is the community saying that. Density, this is a 25-foot lot.

We are neighbors in a single-family, two-flat building with 86% of the population carrying that. We do not want to set a precedent here. The precedent is damaging for the residents of the RS3 assignation of this block, and it opens the door for every other 25-by-125-foot lot to be rezoned as an RM4.5. We feel that the lawyers of this project have misrepresented this as a single lot. It exists in all public records as two lots, and I have included a plan of survey along with 33 supporting members to ask that this does not get passed. I know Alderman Vasquez is here today as well. I ask and request that their team goes back to the lawyers and to the owner and request a resubmission of maybe two separate lots and what they plan on doing with those two separate lots.

Thank you. Thank you very much. Who do I hand my records to?

[Speaker 1] (20:17 - 20:30)
All right. Alan Malice, please. We have testimony from Alan, also written.

[Speaker 24] (20:39 - 20:41)
Good morning, Alan. Good morning, Tom.

[Speaker 1] (20:42 - 20:42)
How are you today?

[Speaker 24] (20:43 - 22:12)
I'm fine. How are you? Good.

I realize this is deferred, but since I came here in the snow and I wrote this testimony, I figured I'd present it. I am Alan Malice, a Lincoln Park community leader for 45 years, speaking as an individual. I am opposed to the proposed rezoning of 1317 West Wrightwood from C11 FAR 1.2 to B23 FAR 3.0. The existing building represents the character of our neighborhood, and you have a photo. The proposed building, a four-story, four-dwelling unit building with a basement will destroy that character. So the question is, what is the justification of an FAR increase of two-and-one-half times the current zoning? Let me repeat that.

They're asking for two-and-one-half times the current zoning, other than to make more money? Will all these units be affordable housing? Will all these four units be disabled accessible?

While the current C11 zoning may no longer be appropriate, a reasonable rezoning would be to RT4, which is the predominant residential zoning in the area. The best outcome would be for the house to be restored with an RT4 zoning classification. In closing, I hope that when this item comes up next meeting, you will remember my testimony and vote to not approve or have it changed.

Thank you, and I'd be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (22:13 - 22:21)
Thank you, Alan. George Blakemore, Mr. George Blakemore.

[Speaker 23] (22:27 - 25:14)
Good morning. Good morning, Mr. Blakemore. I object to your whole procedure.

You have 50 items listed, and you expect the citizens to come up in three minutes and speak on 50 items? They have a right. You're making it convenient for yourself.

You don't want to hear from the citizens. This is social engineering. I'm looking around.

I see all these people in here are white. I see most of these lawyers. Do you know what social engineering is?

They build and create things that's an illusion, that it just happens. It's no coincidence that these 99% of people in here are white. With this economic development, and I just try to warn my people, you're not getting any.

No economic development in these black ghettos is going to occur. Now, I would like to think that it's going to, but I've seen over the years, these showers are blessings. When they come to black people, they're golden showers.

Now, I'm not going in the gutter. That's just what happens. These showers that come down are blessings.

The black communities do not receive them. And your whole process, and you smile, you stay in here four hours, sometimes three hours, when other committees are going on. You don't have to set it up this way.

You do it because you can, and you have the authority. But is it in the interest of good public policy? No.

You stay here all day and night. You're getting paid. You're not volunteering your service up here this morning.

You're getting paid, and you're rich. And I'm saying that you appear to be racist. That's what appears to me.

So again, it's important for people like me, black people, African people, that you see. And you know Trump is not only in D.C., but he's here. The same attitude, just another party.

Just another party. He's right here among you, and you, and you.

[Speaker 1] (25:18 - 26:31)
Any more witnesses? OK, that concludes the public commentary portion of the meeting. We're now moving on to the addendum to the agenda.

First up, we have a substitute mayoral application, MA 2000, document number 0202099, an amendment of municipal code titles 4, 10, 11, 4A, 14B, 14F, 14N, 14R, 14X, 15, and 17, regarding technical corrections to the Chicago Construction Code. Do I hear a motion to accept the substitute ordinance? Alderman Raboyas moves to accept the substitute ordinance.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

Opinion chair, the ayes have it, and the substitute is in front of us. And we have Matt from the department. I see our commissioner is here, too, in case we need her expertise.

But I'm sure Matt will be able to answer on the ordinance and then questions.

[Speaker 28] (26:32 - 27:18)
Morning, chairman and members of the committee. For the record, Matt Bode for as deputy building commissioner. And this ordinance before you is a substitute with technical corrections to the ordinance that was passed last year, the 700-page new building code ordinance, the first in 70 years.

So with 700 pages, we do find some typos along the way and some cross-references that were missed. And then our colleagues in law and fire would point out some items to us. So really, this is just a correction to the code that's already existing.

We want to get these typos and everything fixed so we could print the books at a time and get this all ready to go. So we'd ask for your favorable consideration, and I'd be happy to answer the questions.

[Speaker 1] (27:21 - 27:24)
Questions for Matt or the commissioner?

[Speaker 31] (27:27 - 27:50)
Alderman Lopez. Thank you. Thank you, chairman.

Good morning. Morning, Alderman. Yes, that was quite a voluminous effort, and your department is still to be commended for it.

But I do just have to ask for my own clear conscience. This is strictly typos. There's not going to be any secret aldermanic prerogative dashes put in here by anybody, right?

[Speaker 28] (27:50 - 28:42)
No, nothing dealing with aldermanic prerogative. Just to point out a couple of things, the fire department pointed out a couple of things to us that they would like. One example is they would like what we have up here is the unpainted clear metallic drop-down sprinkler items.

So they pointed out a couple of things to us that were in there. Another example, the liquor commissioner, there's been a longstanding process in liquor when they have a, as part of the agreement to operate for theaters, bars, and that under 100 square, that are under 100 occupancy, the liquor commissioner can require, as part of the license, that they have a placard in there, not to exceed 50, not to exceed 80. So that was another item that was added.

[Speaker 31] (28:42 - 28:46)
So how many non-technical typo-related items other than those two are in here?

[Speaker 28] (28:46 - 28:49)
I think that it's maybe half a dozen.

[Speaker 31] (28:49 - 28:50)
Okay.

[Speaker 28] (28:51 - 28:54)
Again, it was pointed out to us by the law department and the fire department.

[Speaker 31] (28:55 - 29:09)
Understood. I just want to make sure, you know, when we think it's just technical corrections, but then you find out that there's also a few substance, although possibly minor in relation to the overall document. I just want to make sure we're all on the same page.

Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (29:11 - 32:33)
Other questions from committee members? Non-committee members? Okay.

Hearing none, let me make sure that we're going to... Alderman Lopez, moves do pass on this ordinance as amended. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? Opinion Chair, the ayes have it.

So thank you, Matt. Thank you. And thank you, Commissioner, for coming down.

And thank you for being available yesterday on a holiday for me. All right. Moving on to large signs over 100 square feet in area, 24 feet above grade.

We'll hear them all together. I will read the ward followed by the address and take a motion at the end. We're going to start in the third ward, 1212 South Indiana Avenue.

You're aware of that one? Okay, great. In the 19th ward, would you like to testify?

Okay. In the 19th ward, 10421 Southwestern Avenue. In the 27th ward, 404 North Armour Street.

Also in the 27th ward, six signs located at 820 North Orleans Street. In the 32nd ward, 1919 North Palina. Also in the 32nd ward, 2647 North Clybourne.

In the 41st ward, 10801 West Irving Park Road. Is that address correct? All right.

In the 44th ward, three signs located at 946 West Wellington Avenue. And also in the 44th ward, 948 West Oakdale. Questions from committee members?

If not, can I have a motion to pass on the orders? Alderman Beall moves to pass on the orders. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? Opinion chair, the ayes have it.

And these items will be reported out at the February 19th City Council meeting. And now we'll move on to the regular agenda. All right.

What are we doing here? We're on the regular? Okay.

So we do not have certain aldermans for aldermanics. So we're going to move to page two in the 32nd and 47th ward. And that is document number 8509.

As I said, in the 32nd and 47th wards, ordinance referred on November 26th of 19. And this is the change. The applicants are Scott Wagesback and Matt Martin, aldermans.

And the change request is to classify a segment of West Belmont right-of-way from the center line of North Ashland Avenue on the east and the center line of North Paulina Street on the west as a pedestrian street. Who would like to speak? Alderman Wagesback?

[Speaker 6] (32:34 - 33:43)
Thank you, Chairman. Well, the regulations of this section of pedestrian area are intended to preserve and enhance the character of the streets and intersections that are pretty widely recognized as some of Chicago's best examples of pet-oriented shopping districts. So our intention here is to continue to promote the transit economic vitality and the pedestrian safety and comfort.

These areas have a high concentration of stores and restaurants, typically under the pedestrian designation, a right-of-way of 80 feet or less, continuous buildings that abut the sidewalk, et cetera. So the 1600 block of Belmont meets a lot of the criteria, and we think that the P Street designation is appropriate and would assist in the future development and improvement of this block. So I would ask for the committee's favorable consideration, and I think Alderman Martin and I have discussed this, and I think it extends a little further east into your ward, where I think you've done some of those as well.

So that's what we're looking for here today. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (33:43 - 34:22)
And I believe we have Alderman Martin's support. He's not here, right? Great.

Okay. Questions from committee members? Hearing none, do I have a motion?

Move to pass by Alderman Hadden. Moves do pass. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? Then you chair the item as passed.

Thank you, Alderman. All right. Now I'm going to ask my vice chair to come up because we have issues in the 44th Ward, and there's, other than myself, no better person, more knowledgeable person about the 44th Ward than my vice chair, Alderman Raboyas.

Born and raised in 44, if I'm not mistaken.

[Speaker 7] (34:45 - 35:23)
All right. We'll start with item A-8510, 44th Ward, ordinance that was referred on December 18, 2019, document number 02019-9436. Common address 1256-1258 West Belmont.

The change request is an M1-2 limited manufacturing business park district to B3-2 community shopping district. Who's going to speak on this matter? Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (35:24 - 35:29)
Thank you, colleague and vice chairman. This is the, which, this is Belmont first?

[Speaker 7] (35:29 - 35:29)
Belmont.

[Speaker 1] (35:29 - 36:20)
Belmont. Belmont. So, and I think for the benefit of my colleagues, they might want to understand we're doing three zoning changes aldermanically from the M zoning to the surrounding zoning that's more applicable to this.

And this is in order to regulate the cannabis ordinance that would be allowed in M. I know they would still have to go to the zoning board of appeals, but these were odd lots that reflected, you know, an area along Lakewood and it was more industrial over the years. So what we're doing is providing planning for the community, putting the zoning concurrent with what's around it, and effectively not allowing cannabis at these locations.

[Speaker 7] (36:22 - 37:11)
Questions? Moved by Alderman Beall. All in favor?

Opposed? Me and chair of the ayes have it. Next item is 44th ward, number A-8511, an ordinance referred from December 18, 2019, document number 02019-9437, common address 1122-1126 West Eddie street, change request from an M1-2 limited manufacturing to a business park district B2-2 in the community shopping district 44th Ward from M1-2 to B3-2.

[Speaker 1] (37:12 - 37:36)
Thank you vice chairman this again is the same issue it's an odd lot that we had M zoning in order for future planning and to make it more consistent with the surrounding zoning and to prohibit cannabis at this location. I moved in and used my aldermanic control over this for the benefit of the community.

[Speaker 7] (37:36 - 38:33)
Glad you used that word alderman. Alright any questions? Alderman Dow.

So moved by Alderman Dow. All in favor? All opposed?

In opinion of chairs the ayes have it. Another item on the 44th Ward number A-8512 ordinance referred December 18, 2019 document number 02019-9438 common address 3235 North Lakeview Avenue like Lakewood. Change request from M1-2 limited manufacturing to a business park district to RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district.

The chair calls on Alderman Tunney.

[Speaker 1] (38:33 - 38:44)
Thank you vice chairman Raboia. Same same issue the surrounding zoning is RT4 and it's future planning to keep it residential. Any questions?

[Speaker 7] (38:46 - 40:29)
Moved to pass by Alderman Lopez. All in favor? All opposed?

In opinion of chairs the ayes have it. Alright next item a number 20308 page number 9-T1 in the 44th Ward ordinance referred on January 15, 2020 document number 02020-78 common address 3500-04 North Wilton Avenue and 934-38 West Cornelia Avenue. The applicant 3500 Wilton LLC owner 3500 Wilton LLC attorney law offices of Sam Banks, Sarah Barnes.

The change request is an RM-5 residential multi-unit district to an RM-6 residential multi-unit district. The chair calls on Ms. Barnes.

[Speaker 2] (40:29 - 42:56)
Thank you so much Mr. Chairman and members of the committee for the record again even though the chairman did such a nice job my name is Sarah Barnes and I'm an attorney with the law offices of Sam Banks located at 221 North Westdale Street. I have here with me today the managing member of 3200 Wilton LLC Jake Elkins Ryan. Mr. Ryan owns the subject property he acquired it over the summer back in July of 2019. The existing property is currently improved with an old four-story multi-unit residential building which currently contains a total of 17 dwelling units. It's a pretty significant apartment building located in a very highly desirable part of the 44th Ward. It's very close to Wrigley Field as well as to the lake so over time it has always been fully occupied and a desired location for residents of the area.

Unfortunately over time the building has grown outdated both from materially speaking as well as functionally. As such Mr. Ryan purchased the property with the intent to do an extensive rehabilitation of the existing building which will call for a renovation of all of the interior dwelling units as well as the establishment of two additional dwelling units within the building which will provide another alternative more affordable option for residents of the neighborhood because rents have increased quite a bit over there due to again the desirable location. Unfortunately the existing building is quite significantly non-conforming under the current zoning ordinance.

It was likely down zoned over time. This building is probably over a hundred years old so as a result in order to permit the proposal and the rehabilitation of the building we do require the zoning change being sought here today and that was explained by the chairman. We have met as a group with Alderman Tunney as well as the Triangle Neighbors Association which is the local community organization and we do have the support of the local community group and Alderman Tunney perhaps could put some of his considerations on the record and we are happy to answer any questions as well.

[Speaker 7] (42:57 - 43:08)
Any questions the matter before us? Move to pass by Alderman Lopez. All in favor?

Aye. All opposed? The opinion chairs the ayes have it.

[Speaker 2] (43:08 - 43:10)
Thank you. Thank you very much.

[Speaker 7] (43:16 - 44:24)
Next item on the agenda on the referred ordinance number 2016 in the 44th Ward ordinance referred July 24 2019 document number 02019-5598 common address 3450-3480 North Broadway and 645-653 West Cornelia Avenue. Applicant Broadway and Harbor LLC owner Broadway and Harbor LLC attorney Shane Banks law department law. The change request is an RM5 residential multi-unit district and B3-2 community shopping district to B3-3 community shopping district then to a residential business plan development.

Thank you Mr. Chairman. All calls on the office of Shane Banks law.

[Speaker 4] (44:24 - 48:16)
Thank you Mr. Chairman for the record my name is Tyler Manick I'm here with Bill Banks to represent the applicant Broadway and Harbor LLC who owns a property located 3460 North Broadway Chicago Illinois. With me on behalf the applicant is Mark Siegel and Bill Duke. The applicant seeks to amend the zoning for the property located 3460 North Broadway from substantially a B3-2 community shopping district with a small portion being RM5 to a residential business plan development to allow for a seven-story mixed-use building.

The plan development is mandatory under section 178 513A due to its 208 proposed residential units. 3460 North Broadway is located on a pedestrian street. The site is a transit serve location with close proximity to a bus stop located at Lake Shore Drive in Cornelia and to the Addison Red Line stop.

The site was previously utilized as a Treasure Island grocery store. The site contains four existing curb cuts. The applicant intends to close three out of the four existing curb cuts and to modify the southernmost curb cut to access the loading zone and parking garage because the site lacks alley access.

The building's ground floor will contain 13,814 square feet of commercial space and 94 interior parking spaces. The proposed building will be substantially set back along the north south and west elevations at the second level where the residential use begins and provides for green space, private and common terraces and a dog park. The east facade of the building is at the property line through the fourth floor consistent with the property being on a pedestrian commercial street and to align with existing buildings also along the Broadway streetscape.

The proposed building will then be further set back along the east elevation at the fifth floor. The roof plan provides limited amenities of a sun deck, pool, spa, party room and pickleball court. In addition, the building will contain a variety of amenities in its interior.

The proposed building incorporates extensive landscaping throughout and will include an enclosed atrium extending from the ground floor through the seven floors of the building and be capped by a skylight at the roof level. Over the past seven months, the applicant has been in constant contact with the Chairman Tunney's office and met with the Department of Planning Development on four separate times to refine these plans. The applicant has designed the building to terminate at 75 feet.

The applicant proposes to set back the rooftop amenity space and elevator overrun from the building's perimeter so as not to be visible from surrounding sidewalks. These areas only occupy 6.9 percent of the roof area. The applicant has further incorporated other changes into the plans as a result of the meetings with the Chairman and the community including a reduction in height, prominent use of masonry materials for the first four floors on Broadway and Cornelia property lines, holding the Broadway and Cornelia street corner and setting back the fifth and above floors to maintain the existing Broadway streetscape. Given the abundance of available garage parking in the vicinity and modes of public transportation available to the occupants, the applicant and the Chairman agree that the parking ratio is satisfactory.

The applicant further proposes drop-off area on Broadway to accommodate Uber, Lyft and taxi drivers. The applicant has met on several occasions with the East Lakeview Chamber of Commerce, met with the 44th Ward Zoning Advisory Committee twice and held two well-intended public meetings. On January 23rd, 2020, the applicant presented this project to the Chicago Plan Commission which received universal approval.

Accordingly, at this time I request that the committee incorporate the record and proceedings and amended plans from the Chicago Plan Commission into these proceedings.

[Speaker 7] (48:18 - 48:35)
I need a motion to incorporate into the record the planning commission. So moved by Maria Haddon. All in favor?

Aye. It's incorporated.

[Speaker 4] (48:36 - 48:45)
Thank you. At this time we respectfully ask for this committee's favorable recommendation and we would be happy to answer any questions regarding this project.

[Speaker 7] (48:46 - 48:52)
Any questions before this matter? Over to Tony.

[Speaker 1] (48:53 - 50:15)
Thank you, Vice Chairman. And as the attorney has said, a couple things. This project went through numerous reiterations so your patience and also the assistance of the planning department was essential to get us over the finish line.

As was mentioned, I think there's been dozens of meetings, some larger and some smaller, with the immediate neighbors and I think it's a good project. It did receive the support of our community and so I asked for your recommendation. I also want to thank Alderman Kappelman.

He was, we share some of this intersection and he's been helpful answering questions from his constituents and also lending his support for the project if he wants to speak on it, he can. But finally I want to say to council that I don't call Bill Banks, Bill Banks. You know, he's my chairman.

So as a former chairman of zoning, I'd want to make sure that you leave with your highest title. So I just wanted to thank you for your and your firm's assistance on this and really the patience that was endured trying to get this project through. So thank you and I hope that our committee has support for this and because I'm wholeheartedly behind it.

Thank you.

[Speaker 7] (50:15 - 50:19)
Congratulations, it's a good project. Any other questions? Alderman Kappelman?

[Speaker 5] (50:20 - 50:36)
I just want to add that it would also be a huge boost to the retail in the area. These days it's very difficult for retail stores to continue on. We need that density which will add more tax revenue which will help our city.

I fully support it. Thank you.

[Speaker 7] (50:37 - 50:51)
Thank you, Alderman. Motion on the floor by Alderman Riley. All in favor?

Aye. All opposed? Cleaning the chairs, the ayes have it.

Congratulations, guys. The pass as revised, of course.

[Speaker 1] (50:59 - 51:44)
Okay, now we're out of the 44th Ward for the rest of the day. Thank you for your consideration, colleagues. All right, we're going to go back to page 2 in the 11th Ward.

Document number 8513, 11th Ward. Ordinance referred on December 18th of 19. Common address 3300 to 3304 South Halstead Street and the applicant is the Alderman Patrick Thompson.

Change request C13 neighborhood commercial district to a B12 neighborhood shopping district. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Good morning.

[Speaker 25] (51:44 - 52:35)
Morning, members of the committee. I'm here this particular property back in 2016. We had a community meeting to change the zoning from a B12 to a C13 in order to allow for a restaurant with a roof deck.

Unfortunately, that deal did not happen and so we are changing the zoning back to what the original B12 zoning was at that site. That's consistent with what we've been doing throughout the ward and especially on Halstead Street with the B zoning districts versus the C commercial districts and we've seen that has been helpful with developing the types of retailers and restaurants that we're attracting in the community and I would respectfully request your support in changing the zoning back to what it originally was as a B12.

[Speaker 1] (52:36 - 53:42)
Thank you. Alderman questions for Alderman Thompson? Hearing no questions, may I have a motion?

Alderman Hadden moves to pass on the item. All those in favor? Aye.

We're seeking to rezone the property from RS 3 to RT 4.5 for the purposes of placing one four dwelling unit building on the subject site. The site is 36 by 129 and of course we need this for the floor area ratio. We have met with the alderman and his community group and I believe the alderman is supportive.

[Speaker 1] (54:14 - 54:16)
Let's let's hear from Alderman Thompson.

[Speaker 25] (54:18 - 54:38)
Thank You Mr. Chairman yes that is true we had a community meeting was held and we are supportive of this this lot at 2626 is unique it's a larger lot and so to allow for the additional residential is appropriate at this particular location and the community and I fully support this.

good morning mr. chairman and members of the committee for the record my name is Tyler manic the Shane Banks law firm I'm here on behalf of the applicant Daniel Breslin who owns the property located 62 21 West will band Zia mr. Breslin seeks a zoning amendment to 62 21 West will band Zia from an RS 3 zoning district to an RT RM 4.5 zoning district the existing building is a masonry two-story building with 10 dwelling units approximately a hundred years old however two of the garden units are considered non-conforming by the city by this zoning amendment the applicant seeks to make all 10 dwelling units conforming no changes are being proposed to the structure or design of the existing building prior to filing this application the applicant met with all their mentality of Pharaoh to discuss this project and no concerns have been raised by the community since about this project either the alderman has given us his support for the project and I do believe you have a letter of support in your file we do have a letter of support at this time mr.

[Speaker 1] (1:10:26 - 1:11:41)
Breslin and I would be happy to answer any questions but we'd like this committee's favorable recommendation to approve this zoning amendment questions by committee members hearing none alderman Lopez moves do pass all those in favor aye any opposed didn't you chair the ayes have it and thank you mr. chairman oh thank you very much now if you're ready Alderman Irvin we're gonna go back to looks like page okay give me a second we're gonna do this one all right let me go back for the members page to document number a a a as an Albert 8507 in the 28th Ward ordinance referred on November 26th of 19 the common address is 2701 through 13 West Harrison Street and the change request m1 to limited manufacturing business park district to an RT for residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district alderman Thank You mr.

[Speaker 16] (1:11:41 - 1:12:36)
chairman this apparently seemed to be more of a mistake when the area was rezoned I guess years ago there are four three flat buildings that sit and what traditionally would have been m1 type space however these buildings are over a hundred years old and probably should have never been zoned as m zoning when that map amendment took place I guess probably some 15 years ago and these four houses sit next to right on the corner of Washtenaw and Harrison four houses on the corner there but the rest of the block is a is light manufacturing and other things but these four houses sit by themselves the predominant zone in any area is the RT for and which is directly behind it but these four houses somehow got mapped into an M district and they should not have been all right questions for the

[Speaker 1] (1:12:36 - 1:13:38)
alderman hearing none can I get a motion alderman Haddon moves to pass on the item all those in favor aye any opposed then you chair the ayes have it and the item is passed Thank You alderman you have anything else on here the next oh I'm sorry stay on page 2 we have document number 8 5 0 8 in the 28th Ward the ordinance was referred on November 26th of 19 this common address is 5 0 0 through 5 1 4 South Claremont Avenue 501 through 515 South Claremont Avenue 500 through 514 South Oakley Boulevard and 2300 through 2344 West Harrison Street the change request to an RT or residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to an RT 3.5 residential two-flat townhouse in

[Speaker 16] (1:13:38 - 1:14:30)
Alderman thank you again mr. chairman this this zoning request was part of a much larger area for the tri-tailor community the request from the tri-tailor Community Association to bring the zoning down a tad tad bit and to create larger lot sizes to build bigger units so currently what we're seeing in that community are teardowns and the Association is not interested in continuing to have teardowns and wants to preserve the historical character of the neighborhood and by you know making this slight adjustment we believe that it will stop these types of activities of buildings being torn down and built back with much larger denser units which is not in the character of the

[Speaker 1] (1:14:30 - 1:14:41)
neighborhood well Alderman before we go to any questions I know you have a more holistic area is that correct Nicole and this is only a portion of this no

[Speaker 16] (1:14:41 - 1:15:44)
actually there there there are there's a portion okay let me say tri-tailor is roughly bounded by the Eisenhower on the south Roosevelt Road to the north Ogden to the west and there are set of railroad tracks in between Rockwell and Washtenaw I'm sorry on the east and then to the west there are set of railroad tracks that separate East Garfield Park from their West community in between Rockwell and Washtenaw so that box right there is what what the tri-tailor Community Association we've been focused on and again there the zoning there is extremely generous I mean you have rm5 you have a lot of just very dense type zoning and the community wants to step that back a little bit so this is this has been part of a larger conversation we passed one set I think a month or two ago this is the second set and then there's another set on the on the west side of Western between Western and the railroad tracks I mentioned earlier so this is all part of that whole conversation right it questions for the

[Speaker 1] (1:15:44 - 1:15:57)
alderman on this specific application hearing none Alderman Alderman Lopez moves to pass on the item all those in favor aye any opposed any chair the

[Speaker 5] (1:31:17 - 1:32:30)
chairman members of the committee Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant here with me is Irina Koval representing the applicant this is a parcel but it's a twelve thousand five hundred square foot parcel on Bryn Mawr Avenue on the north side of Bryn Mawr what's essentially the commercial area of this neighborhood that has been a little underutilized for at least ten years if not thirty years I should say mr. chairman I live about two blocks from here and have for about 30 years so I'm very familiar with this parcel we're trying to revitalize the alderman's trying to revitalize this portion of Bryn Mawr get more density there so that the commercial can be occupied and in that regard with my clients proposing to build a 30 unit four-story 30 unit building with 30 parking spaces 1,500 square feet of commercial on the ground floor fronting Bryn Mawr the building has a significant facade so we are preserving the facade and building the new building behind the existing facade we had a community meeting in the neighborhood and received the support of the local community organization and I did notice that Alderman Nugent was here earlier but she seemingly has left

[Speaker 1] (1:32:37 - 1:32:45)
happy to answer any questions. Alderman Nugent has voiced her support for this project do we have do you have something else you want?

[Speaker 5] (1:32:45 - 1:33:18)
I had one more matter when I noted the address on this application on this application okay when I noted the address on the ordinance at the bottom I used a full address range that could theoretically correspond to this property which would be 3244-52 the neighbor who is on the property it could also be 52 was rather upset about the my use of the 52 so I committed to her so that she would no longer be so upset that I would amend the just change the only thing I've changed is the address at the very bottom and I have a substitute ordinance for that.

[Speaker 1] (1:33:19 - 1:33:22)
Well thanks for telling us. What are we doing here?

[Speaker 36] (1:33:25 - 1:33:36)
Yeah yeah that's just a scrivener's error I mean the common address is just there to give us an idea where it's at the ordinance control so it doesn't include that property so there really is no need for a substitute unless.

[Speaker 5] (1:33:37 - 1:33:41)
I tried to explain that to her she wasn't listening so I figured rather than have her continue to be upset.

[Speaker 1] (1:33:42 - 1:35:10)
Well we'll take it anyways we're not doing a substitute okay okay but we'll have a for the file. Okay other questions? There are no questions.

[Speaker 21] (1:41:50 - 1:43:47)
Good morning. Thank You Mr. Chairman. For the record my name is Scott Safe of the law firm Sidley Austin LLP offices at One South Dearborn in Chicago.

I'm here on behalf of the commuter rail division of the Regional Transportation Authority known as METRA. With me today to my right is Nate Morris director of civil and structural design for METRA and to his right is Elisa Stanford a structural engineer in METRA's engineering department. METRA is seeking a rezoning from M11 to T.

The purpose of the rezoning is to facilitate the rehabilitation and reconstruction of METRA's Grayland station which is on its Milwaukee district north line. The area to be rezoned is generally in the vicinity of Milwaukee, Kilbourne and Addison. It's a long rectangular stretch.

METRA has about 70 just under 70 parking spaces. That number is not changing. The station today is an older consists of platforms and an older concrete inbound shelter and a couple small shelters on the east side.

What's happening is in conjunction with a replacement of a 100 120 year old railroad bridge over Milwaukee Avenue METRA is improving and upgrading the station. The platforms will be slightly relocated. There'll be new brick, glass and metal enclosed passenger shelters which will be constructed with doors and on-demand heat and station improvements which will include accessible ramps to the both platforms inbound and outbound making the station fully accessible.

A temporary station will be built to allow the station to continue to function during construction. The temporary station will be closer to Addison to the south. It's a 30 million dollar project funded by it's a significant part by federal dollars.

METRA hopes to begin in the summer of this year and finish the project in 2022. We'd be happy to answer any questions and would appreciate your favorable consideration.

[Speaker 1] (1:43:48 - 1:44:04)
Now have you talked do we have a letter of support from Alderman Gardner? Okay so we do have a letter of support from the Alderman and then so questions from committee members I have Alderman Roboyes.

[Speaker 7] (1:44:07 - 1:44:35)
Thank you Chairman that's a rendering obviously is there was there any planning involved regarding the parking spaces? If you're moving south closer to Addison I don't know if that's gonna happen temporary are you guys adding any more parking that we need in that area? I'm just immediately on the Addison side.

I was asked years ago we had a conversation on this matter years ago.

[Speaker 21] (1:44:35 - 1:44:57)
The parking was expanding probably no was expanded in the last few years there's just 67 parking spaces the platforms are moving just 30 feet south so still within the boundaries of the existing parking there's no there there is no plan to change the parking that was additional parking spaces? I don't know if there's any room for the additional parking.

[Speaker 1] (1:45:03 - 1:45:09)
You're saying his question is the amount of parking what I'm hearing is there's no additional parking?

[Speaker 5] (1:45:10 - 1:45:10)
Correct.

[Speaker 1] (1:45:10 - 1:45:15)
Okay now do you want to bring your identify yourself and let's hear what from you.

[Speaker 9] (1:45:15 - 1:45:24)
All right I'm Nate Morris director of structural design for Metra and no there will be no additional parking maintaining the existing parking as it is.

[Speaker 7] (1:45:24 - 1:45:36)
How many parking spaces do you guys have now? 67. What are the hours on that?

What are the hours on the parking? That's correct.

[Speaker 21] (1:45:36 - 1:45:47)
I don't believe the hours are restricted the the only change to the parking will be during the time of construction some of the parking spaces may be out of operation to allow for staging of the crew.

[Speaker 7] (1:45:49 - 1:45:52)
All right thank you. Other questions?

[Speaker 1] (1:45:54 - 1:46:07)
Hearing none can I get a motion? Alderman Cardona moves to pass on this item as amended. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? Then ensure the item is passed as amended.

Thank you and good luck.

[Speaker 21] (1:46:08 - 1:46:09)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:46:09 - 1:46:39)
All right okay all right we're in the bottom of page 9 the document number 20314 in the 46th Ward ordinance was referred on January 15th of this year. Common address is 4071 North Broadway. Change request is a C13 neighborhood commercial district to a B23 neighborhood mixed-use district.

All right Mr. Silver good morning how are you today?

[Speaker 18] (1:46:39 - 1:48:44)
I'm fine thanks Mr. Chairman good morning to you and to members of the committee. For the record my name is Warren Silver, Silver Law Office PC. We're here today representing the applicant and owner of the property Dr. David Lee Hincamp. He along with his wife reside in this property. It is artists live workspace pursuant to special uses granted in October of 2005 in January of 2009. The current zoning is C1-3 and we are seeking to change the zoning to B2-3.

The purpose of the zoning change is because Dr. Hincamp and his wife are seeking to develop some office space for his wife's business in the front of the property. It would involve improvement of the facade bigger windows and also reduction of the artists live workspace because they anticipate from time to time depending on the needs of the artist use and the needs of the business as they may change from time to time they may in the future want to change again the division between artists live work and office space without coming back for another special use every single time because both uses are permitted without a special use in the B2 district.

We're seeking the zoning change. We met with the community interested community members at the property. Dr. Hincamp and his wife had them in their home to see the property and discuss the project. We received favorable support and Alderman Kaplan was in attendance at that meeting and is in attendance here today as well. We invite Alderman Kaplan to speak on it if you would like and also to entertain the questions and we will ask the committee for its favorable recommendation. Thank you sir.

Alderman Kaplan.

[Speaker 5] (1:48:45 - 1:48:54)
You went through our community process. The community was in favor of it so I ask everyone's support as well. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:48:56 - 1:49:39)

[Speaker 34] (1:49:42 - 1:50:41)
Yep. Almost. Thank you my name is Alfred Quijano.

Q-U-I-J-A-N-O on behalf of the applicant KK Court Investments to my right is Daniel Baranski with the corporation. The applicant owns the property located at 3726 North Ashland and seeks the zoning change from C1-2 to B2-3. The applicant seeks to construct a four unit masonry building with four dwelling units and four parking spaces.

A community meeting was held on November 14th of year 2019. At that community meeting members of community wanted the developer to incorporate certain green elements to the design. So we have entered into a memorandum of understanding with the community to incorporate permeable pavers and a partial green roof design.

We did have a letter of support issued by Alderman Martinsoff which I believe you do have. We have. So I do ask for your consideration of the application and move forward to any questions you may have.

[Speaker 1] (1:50:42 - 1:51:45)
Questions from committee members? Nope. Hearing none, Alderman Cardona moves to pass on the item.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

[Speaker 29] (1:51:46 - 1:51:49)
Chairman Tony, good morning. Is Alderman LaSpada here?

[Speaker 1] (1:51:49 - 1:51:49)
No.

[Speaker 29] (1:51:53 - 1:51:55)
Okay great. So this is 2418.

[Speaker 1] (1:51:55 - 1:51:56)
You knew that already.

[Speaker 29] (1:51:57 - 1:52:34)
I just at 1130 Mr. Chairman I got a email with some tweaks. Okay. So this is application 20272 there's an amendment substitute plans and narrative which we dropped off earlier this week and I'd like to call out that Alderman LaSpada has asked on behalf of the community group that a stone sill be extended out an additional inch.

That's a change from the substitute that we dropped off and that some stone be replaced by a soldier course of brick. I just want to put that on the record because that's what he asked us to do.

[Speaker 1] (1:52:35 - 1:52:36)
So you're changing material?

[Speaker 29] (1:52:36 - 1:52:37)
Yes that's all.

[Speaker 1] (1:52:37 - 1:52:38)
That's it?

[Speaker 29] (1:52:38 - 1:52:38)
That's it.

[Speaker 1] (1:52:39 - 1:52:42)
You're not moving out? No. I thought you said you were moving a little bit of that.

[Speaker 29] (1:52:42 - 1:53:22)
So I represent EZMB. Mr. Teets was here. I think he just stepped out to go to the restroom but this is a change to RT4 for four units and they're much larger units.

We met with Greater Gerthe Neighborhood Association many many times and they've been making changes including at 1130 this morning Mr. Chairman but the site is a little bigger. It's 44 feet by 110. We are reducing the FAR to 1.05 from the normal RT4 FAR and it sounds as if we have the support of Alderman LaSpada as of this morning.

[Speaker 1] (1:53:24 - 1:54:13)
Okay we do have a letter or an email of support from Alderman LaSpada. We need to do a couple of things. First Alderman Sitio Lopez moves to accept the substantive narrative and plans for the type 1.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

Guys have it and the substitute narrative and plans are accepted. Now based on the testimony do we have questions from committee members? No we have no questions.

We have Alderman Riley moves to pass with the substitute narrative and plans. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Opinion chair the ayes have it and this item is passed with this substantive narrative and plans.

[Speaker 29] (1:54:14 - 1:54:14)
Thank You Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:54:16 - 1:54:22)
Yeah yeah okay that's go back now to the regular agenda correct?

[Speaker 29] (1:54:24 - 1:54:30)
Mr. Chairman excuse me the one that follows on the deferred agenda could that be continued to the to a date certain?

[Speaker 1] (1:54:31 - 1:54:37)
Okay hold on a second. Dan is requesting which item number please?

[Speaker 29] (1:54:39 - 1:54:42)
20267. Okay thank you Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:54:43 - 1:55:28)
Sorry about that. All right what do we say page 4? Where we at for Brendan?

Is licensing over? Okay middle of page 8 document number 20310 in the 42nd Ward the ordinance was referred on January 15th of 20 common address 57 through 63 West Erie Street and the change request is plan development number 1356 to a DX 5 downtown mixed-use district. Good morning.

Good morning. Morning Meg.

[Speaker 14] (1:55:29 - 1:56:43)
Good morning Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My name is Meg George an attorney with the law firm of Akerman LLP. I am here today on behalf of my client LG Development Group LLC.

Joining me is Mr. Gabe LeHoux design and program manager for LG Development. Together we are requesting your support and approval to remove 57 to 61 West Erie from residential plan development number 1356 and to rezone it to its existing underlying zoning district of DX 5. The project is located within Alderman Riley's 42nd Ward in the River North neighborhood.

The plan development was originally approved in January 2017 for a 12-story residential condo building. The project has since changed to a six-story hotel building with 28 hotel rooms and ground floor retail. The proposed use is allowed in the existing underlying district and as the project no longer triggers the plan development height or bonus threshold we are seeking its removal.

We have met with the Department of Transportation, the Department of Planning and Development, the River North Residents Association and Alderman Riley to develop these revised plans. That concludes our presentation but we're ready to answer any questions that you may have.

[Speaker 1] (1:56:44 - 1:56:48)
Point of clarification I see on the narrative it's a five-story now it's a six-story?

[Speaker 14] (1:56:50 - 1:56:57)
Yeah it's a six-story. Still under the yeah I just yes no thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:56:57 - 1:57:02)
Okay Alderman Riley like to speak on this item on Erie.

[Speaker 12] (1:57:05 - 1:58:02)
Thank you Chairman. I'm here to speak in support of this change as was noted by Council. There was a plan development in place on this site that was approved in 2017 for a much larger residential structure.

Obviously that plan was not able to be executed so the developers come back with a revised proposal that would allow for a boutique style hotel only a handful of keys and that was met with positive comments from the River North Residents Association. It will not be disruptive use on this block. This block is a mix of mixed-use buildings residential and commercial and generally the neighborhood believes that this will be a positive addition.

So for those reasons I support the application and would be happy to answer any questions and I'd urge a favorable recommendation by this committee. Thank you Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:58:03 - 1:58:20)
Questions for the Alderman or the applicant? So quick question boutique is a very all-encompassing word is it is there a banner under a certain hotel brand and what is what are the number of hotel keys?

[Speaker 6] (1:58:21 - 1:58:32)
It's 28 hotel keys and the flag is Sondra. They do short-term rentals that are apartment style keys. They provide kitchen and washer and dryers for their occupants.

[Speaker 14] (1:58:32 - 1:58:38)
And Sondra has met with the Alderman several times regarding other developments and this development.

[Speaker 35] (1:58:39 - 1:58:39)
Alderman?

[Speaker 12] (1:58:40 - 1:59:33)
And actually Chairman if I could just to explain very briefly the Sondra model because it sounds a little different it is. Sondra's approach is to take typically its existing buildings in this case it would be new construction and rehabbing those buildings and inserting these units. They do get licensed as hotels but the units themselves do behave a lot like a VRBO type of arrangement so that you could spend a bit more time there there's a bit more money within the unit there is you know a limited staff on-site but certainly the site is secured and serviced with linens and these sorts of things.

So it's not as grand a scale of an operation as a traditional hotel but that's how this particular model works and again in this case we're talking about 28 keys.

[Speaker 1] (1:59:34 - 1:59:35)
Great. Thank you. Alderman Dowell.

[Speaker 32] (1:59:37 - 1:59:48)
I have a question for the Alderman. Alderman do they have a the right to do Airbnb type activity or do they do Airbnb type activity?

[Speaker 12] (1:59:49 - 2:00:29)
They're actually because they're licensed as a hotel operator they are bound by all the strictures of the code that apply but again you don't have the full suite of services you might get in a typical limited service hotel but they do have folks servicing the site cleaning it they have security but maybe not a concierge a bellhop and check-in. Perhaps the the operator or the developer could speak to it in more detail but it is a very scaled back version of a limited service hotel when it comes to the actual services. Really these are units being let out and folks have a remote key that they can use to access the unit.

[Speaker 1] (2:00:32 - 2:00:34)
Hold on. Alderman Dowell.

[Speaker 32] (2:00:35 - 2:00:49)
Thank the Alderman for that explanation but my question was specific to the ability to operate Airbnb type activity in a Sonder. Meg do you want to answer that on behalf of the operator?

[Speaker 14] (2:00:51 - 2:01:42)
Sonder is is a hotel operator. They pay hotel tax. These are not listed on Airbnb or VRBO websites so they how they operate differently and is that their target customer they tell me all the time is the experientialist.

I had to ask them what that word was and it's apparently like this new generation that doesn't really want to interact with concierge desk type people so everything is through your phone so your hotel room key is on the app on your phone so you go directly to the door the outer door and then the inner door with that key so but there we do have staff on site but it's just it's not as many staff as you'd see at like a you know a larger hotel chain. There's not like a significant front desk.

[Speaker 32] (2:01:43 - 2:01:59)
And I guess my last question I know that Sonder is like scaling up in Chicago. Is this model that you are describing the model that's being used in every location that they operate in in Chicago?

[Speaker 14] (2:01:59 - 2:02:11)
Yes for every new Sonder development they are operating this model but as Alderman Riley stated typically they go into existing buildings and try to rehab this is a little bit different for them and that they're doing a new construction.

[Speaker 32] (2:02:12 - 2:02:26)
Well I have them in my ward in a new building and so I just want to make sure that the way they operate in the 42nd ward is the same way they're operating in the third ward. Yes. Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (2:02:27 - 2:02:28)
All right Alderman Hopkins.

[Speaker 18] (2:02:30 - 2:03:04)
Thank You Mr. Chair Airbnb was mentioned but Airbnb is not the only rental platform that is vulnerable to being used for illegal parties and loud activities. Sonder is one of the companies that has discussed at least using utilizing technology to find out if their property is being used for a party. They were actually considering having sound monitor devices installed within the building that could detect a loud raucous party and give them advance notice.

Is that a feature that this this building will have incorporated into it?

[Speaker 14] (2:03:04 - 2:03:19)
Feature for for all of their buildings and it is it doesn't record but it monitors decibel levels and if it gets to a certain decibel level the person on site and their manager are both notified. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:03:22 - 2:03:36)
So Meg you had a issue about experiential and Alderman Ciccio Lopez left as you were saying that so maybe Alderman Haddon can describe this young experiential experience that you're all looking for in hotels.

[Speaker 32] (2:03:36 - 2:03:39)
Do I get to speak for Millennials? Wow.

[Speaker 1] (2:03:41 - 2:03:55)
As a hotel guy this is very interesting in terms of you know no no services as you walk in the hotel and go to your room you got and everything's on your phone and the key so Alderman Haddon maybe you can help.

[Speaker 6] (2:03:55 - 2:04:18)
So I haven't been to one of your facilities and no offense to the model but going to a hotel with no people and no staff does not necessarily sound quite like mine. Welcoming to you. No no we were actually laughing about the noise management system and how concierge or front desk person would serve that really well.

Yeah not sure.

[Speaker 1] (2:04:18 - 2:04:50)
Sorry I you know I'm an ex or whatever the hell I am I don't know. You were the youngest person in the room I thought you might be able to help us with that. Alright well as was stated the hotel business is changing as we speak from traditional models to not traditional models and you know I'm excited you have other sites in Chicago?

[Speaker 6] (2:04:51 - 2:05:03)
LG development owns 417 South Dearborn it's a 30 key sauna building they occupy the whole building similar to what we're proposing here and they've been in operation for just over a year now. No issues.

[Speaker 35] (2:05:04 - 2:05:06)
Okay yep.

[Speaker 6] (2:05:06 - 2:05:08)
Gabe Lee who would LG development group.

[Speaker 1] (2:05:09 - 2:06:27)
Great comments or more questions hearing none. Alderman Cappleman to pass on this item as is. All those in favor aye.

All the I should have had you move the ordinance I'm sorry. Any opposed? Hearing none item is passed.

Congratulations. All right all right all right what we're bottom of page 11 okay all right bottom of page 11 number 201 39 4th Ward ordinance referred on September 18th of 19 common address is 1330 East 53rd Street change request plan development 1218 to plan development 1218 as amended. Who's coming down?

Are we here? We were all mesmerized by the previous application.

[Speaker 14] (2:06:28 - 2:07:03)
Chairman I'm Amy Kersen from the law firm Reyes Kersen on behalf of Enterprise Rent-A-Car I have Dana Melzer here from Enterprise Rent-A-Car as well. We're here on an incredibly easy matter this is an existing building it's an existing parking structure and Enterprise Rent-A-Car would like to use some of the parking spaces that are not otherwise required to park and lease cars. This is a simple use change in an existing plan development.

We did have a community meeting we have support from the community we have the Alderman's letter of support and I'm hoping this will be your easiest matter of the day.

[Speaker 1] (2:07:04 - 2:07:09)
Okay do we have a letter of support first of all? You have one?

[Speaker 14] (2:07:09 - 2:07:10)
I have one with me.

[Speaker 1] (2:07:10 - 2:07:59)
Okay so we'll do a couple things first. We want to incorporate the the plans from the Plan Commission. Alderman Roboyes moves to incorporate the records from the Plan Commission.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

The ayes have it. Records are incorporated and we've heard your testimony. We have a letter of support?

Yes we do. Questions from committee members? Sounds like a pretty reasonable and easy if there is such a thing.

All right questions comments? Hearing none Alderman Hadden moves to pass as revised. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it and this item is passed as revised.

[Speaker 14] (2:07:59 - 2:08:00)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (2:08:01 - 2:08:43)
Yes all right now we want to move back to where we at now. We're in the Alderman Sitio Lopez. I think we're on bottom of page 12 and this item is 20300 T1 in the 25th Ward.

The ordinance was referred on December 18th of 19 common address 1751 West 21st place and the change request our T4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district will be to three neighborhood mixed-use district. Tyler.

[Speaker 4] (2:08:44 - 2:09:54)
Thank You Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record my name is Tyler Manick of the Shane Banks law firm. I'm here on behalf of the applicant Harrison Street Partners who owns a property located at 1751 West 21st place which is a subject of this application.

Matthew Patel is here on behalf of the ownership and would be happy to answer any questions afterwards. This is an existing building as a two-story four unit building. The purpose of the rezoning is to allow the applicant to perform deferred maintenance on the building and add a third story where two new dwelling units will be located.

The applicant has agreed to make these two new units affordable so that after rezoning the building will be free of any structural deficiencies have a third story and we'll have a total of six dwelling units two of which will be affordable. Prior to filing this application the applicant met with the alderman and his zoning advisory council and the applicant I believe is here to voice his support for this application to amend the zoning of 1751 West 21st place to a B2-3 zoning district. Great so Alderman Sitio Lopez.

[Speaker 27] (2:09:55 - 2:10:37)
Thank you Chairman. I'd also like to thank the applicant for working with us. Obviously in Pilsen we have a big issue of affordable housing especially when it's below 10 units.

It's not a mandate to provide affordable housing. I'm very glad to see more proposals being sensitive to that and working with us. We'll be working with the Commissioner Housing to make sure that these units remain affordable but I really want to thank the applicant to be willing to work with us and be sensitive to the needs of the neighborhood.

So I'm in support of this this application and I look forward to make sure that we find a process to keep these two units affordable and that's a great thing for the community.

[Speaker 1] (2:10:38 - 2:11:14)
Thank you Alderman. Good good work in your community. Questions for the alderman or the applicant?

I have just quick one confirmation we have six units upon completion with one parking space. Okay so there'll be three parking spaces. Correct.

Okay a little footnote on my records here. Okay do I have a motion? Alderman Dowell moves to pass on this item.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

Can you chair the ayes have it item is passed.

[Speaker 4] (2:11:14 - 2:11:15)
Thank you Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:11:15 - 2:11:46)
Good luck you sir. All right staying on page 12 on the top the item number 20287 8th Ward ordinance referred on December 18th of 19. The common address is 1050 through 1060 East 95th Street and the change request to it from M11 limited manufacturing business park district to M21 light industry district.

[Speaker 5] (2:11:49 - 2:12:41)
Good afternoon Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon. Members of the committee Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant.

Here with me is Surayu Patel on behalf of DL3 the applicant. The matter before you is to rezone this property from an M11 to an M21. It is a twenty eight thousand eight hundred square foot parcel with approximately thirteen thousand six hundred square foot building.

The purpose of the rezoning is to enable the property to be used. We'll also have to seek a special use for a craft grow facility for a social equity applicant. We are currently working with a series of them trying to find the appropriate one for the site.

We have had a meeting in the community Alderman Harris had one at her offices and we have received the support of the community as well as the Alderman who I believe has communicated that to the committee.

[Speaker 1] (2:12:41 - 2:12:44)
The Alderman has committed her support on this item.

[Speaker 5] (2:12:46 - 2:12:47)
We're happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (2:12:49 - 2:12:53)
Alderman Walter Burnett. Yeah thank you.

[Speaker 3] (2:12:54 - 2:12:59)
So you have a so when you say social equity what's the makeup?

[Speaker 5] (2:13:00 - 2:13:09)
So the proposal here is that the the ultimate operator will be predominantly that's over 50% hopefully as much as possible African-American.

[Speaker 3] (2:13:10 - 2:13:12)
Is this the one that Leon is involved in?

[Speaker 5] (2:13:12 - 2:13:17)
Leon Walker is the principal of DL3 Realty the the owner of the property yes.

[Speaker 3] (2:13:17 - 2:13:21)
He's the owner of the property so he's going to be part of the business also?

[Speaker 5] (2:13:21 - 2:13:23)
He may be part of the operator here.

[Speaker 3] (2:13:23 - 2:13:24)
So may is a big word.

[Speaker 5] (2:13:24 - 2:13:42)
It is a big word. He we have to first get a operator but we're only talking to African-American social equity operators and then whether Leon is part of it or not will depend on terms but we have committed to the Alderman as well as the community that will be African-American.

[Speaker 3] (2:13:42 - 2:13:56)
So the craft grow and I don't I'm not familiar with how to craft grow work. Is it and is it and excuse my ignorance right because all this is fake stuff. Is it similar to the dispensary?

[Speaker 5] (2:13:56 - 2:13:58)
No. So craft grow is the production?

[Speaker 3] (2:13:58 - 2:14:07)
I know it's a production. Of cannabis? I'm talking about is it similar to how they trying to do the rollout with the new dispensary then you have to have social equity?

[Speaker 5] (2:14:08 - 2:14:29)
It is similar in that respect although you can have craft grow that doesn't have social equity in it just like the dispensaries. There is a round of craft grow licensing that the state is going to open up in early March that before we go to the dispensary there will be no dispensing from this property that's another commitment we say to the neighborhood.

[Speaker 3] (2:14:29 - 2:14:31)
So it won't be just growing?

[Speaker 5] (2:14:31 - 2:14:35)
This is just growing and then it will be shipped off-site for sale.

[Speaker 3] (2:14:36 - 2:14:39)
So how many jobs do you think will be produced in the craft grow?

[Speaker 5] (2:14:39 - 2:15:11)
Probably around the 30-40 jobs and it depends on how you want to look at jobs or jobs on site but there's also security, there's transportation, there's packaging, so there's a whole set of ancillary jobs. We're also working with Chicago State University because they have a cannabis educational program and trying to link this facility with their program to create a step towards employment. Also with Olive Harvey College which has a logistics program transporting material.

[Speaker 3] (2:15:11 - 2:15:15)
So it's going to be an inside growing facility?

[Speaker 5] (2:15:15 - 2:15:17)
All inside you won't tell what's happening from the outside.

[Speaker 3] (2:15:20 - 2:15:22)
So would this be the first one in the city?

[Speaker 5] (2:15:24 - 2:15:31)
I don't know the answer to that question. I don't I don't know that there's craft grow or there may be a cultivation center in the city.

[Speaker 3] (2:15:31 - 2:15:35)
So what's the requirement for craft grow? What zoning is required?

[Speaker 5] (2:15:37 - 2:15:38)
M2 or M3?

[Speaker 3] (2:15:39 - 2:15:40)
What about PMDs?

[Speaker 5] (2:15:40 - 2:15:46)
I believe you can be in PMDs. I defer to Mr. Valenziano but I believe that's right.

[Speaker 36] (2:15:47 - 2:16:03)
That's Steve Valenziano, Department of Planning and Development and craft growers can be established in the C2, the C3, the DX and the M2 and M3 and the planned manufacturing districts.

[Speaker 3] (2:16:04 - 2:16:11)
So if they already have the zoning do they have to go to ZBA or anything like that?

[Speaker 36] (2:16:12 - 2:16:21)
Yes all of the cannabis businesses other than transporters have to go through a special use process so they need the proper base zoning and then they would need a special use beyond that.

[Speaker 3] (2:16:22 - 2:16:44)
So with the craft grow, so you still have to go to the ZBA? Yes sir. Even with it?

Yes. And so after you go to the ZBA do that mean you're approved or or do you still have to go before, do you still have to go before the Department of Federal Regulations?

[Speaker 5] (2:16:44 - 2:16:52)
Yes so so yeah the ZBA would only give us approval to use the building but the licensing is still done by the State Department of Professional Regulation.

[Speaker 3] (2:16:52 - 2:17:14)
So from the from the dispensary meeting that we had the night Paul Stewart came and explained after you go to the ZBA if you get approved at the ZBA then you have to do a build-out to qualify to go to this is what the dispensary had to do a build-out to qualify to be able to go before the state to get approved.

[Speaker 5] (2:17:15 - 2:17:30)
No so the build-out requirement that Mr. Stewart noted the other night is for the plus ones so those are existing licensees that have medical licenses that would get one more license pursuant to state regulations. This you do not have to necessarily build it out.

[Speaker 3] (2:17:30 - 2:17:33)
So craft bills don't have to get built out before they go to the state?

[Speaker 5] (2:17:34 - 2:17:39)
That's correct. We need to have filed for our special use before going to the state.

[Speaker 3] (2:17:40 - 2:17:47)
And so so you just file for your special use, have your have your ownership of the space or wherever the space is going to be, have control of the space.

[Speaker 29] (2:17:47 - 2:17:48)
Yes sir.

[Speaker 3] (2:17:49 - 2:18:04)
And then you go to the Office of Professional Standards and they give you the and they choose who so do they have like areas how many can go in a certain area like the dispensary? I don't know.

[Speaker 5] (2:18:04 - 2:18:17)
I'm sorry I don't know. It's okay I don't think there's a 1,500 like with dispensaries there's a 1,500 foot lineal separation. I don't believe that applies to craft grow but I am I am not an expert on the state regs.

[Speaker 3] (2:18:17 - 2:18:20)
They may be able to be next door to each other.

[Speaker 5] (2:18:20 - 2:18:34)
They could you you could also have craft grow and processing which is creating the for example the edibles the chocolate bars and gummy bears in the same building so long as they are separate operations divided by walls.

[Speaker 3] (2:18:34 - 2:18:42)
So you can have two dispensaries and one two not dispensaries but two craft grows in the same space almost?

[Speaker 5] (2:18:43 - 2:18:50)
I think you can have one craft grow and one infuser or processor in the same building but not the same space.

[Speaker 3] (2:18:51 - 2:18:55)
You all don't have to go through a lottery or any of that other any of those other things?

[Speaker 4] (2:18:55 - 2:18:56)
With the city? No no.

[Speaker 3] (2:18:56 - 2:19:04)
I mean with the state like you had to with the city or the state? No we. You all don't have to do lotteries there's not zones where you have to have a certain amount of people in?

[Speaker 5] (2:19:05 - 2:19:21)
That's all a matter of city regulations for the state we if we can get to our special-use filing we can file with the state the state then evaluates whether we are qualified and appropriately organized to operate craft grow and if they do they'd give us a license and then we would build it out.

[Speaker 3] (2:19:23 - 2:19:29)
All right. Fantastic. Thank you for the education.

Oh it's still evolving.

[Speaker 1] (2:19:29 - 2:19:43)
Yeah it's still evolving. I'm still learning every day something new. All right so Alderman Scott Wogsbeck moves to pass on this item all those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? The chair the ayes have it item is passed.

[Speaker 5] (2:19:44 - 2:19:44)

Alderman Roboyas moves to defer. All those in favor? Aye.

All right top of page 13 document number 201 1 2 27th Ward ordinance referred on July 24th of 19 common address 800 West Lake Street change request C 1 1 neighborhood commercial district and C 2 5 motor vehicle related commercial district to DX 7 downtown mixed-use district and then to a business plan development.

Katie.

[Speaker 10] (2:21:00 - 2:21:27)
Good afternoon Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record my name is Katie Jenke Dale with the law firm of DLA Piper. I represent the applicant North Park Ventures LLC.

With me today are representatives from the applicant, the architect, and the traffic consultant. As a preliminary matter this matter was concerned or considered and recommended for approval at the January 23rd 2020 Planned Commission hearing. We would request that a transcript from the hearing be incorporated into the record.

[Speaker 1] (2:21:29 - 2:21:39)
So Alderman Beal moves to incorporate the records from the Planned Commission. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Hearing none the ayes have it and the records are incorporated. Continue.

[Speaker 10] (2:21:39 - 2:22:40)
Thank you. The property is located at the northwest corner of Lake and Halstead and currently zoned C 1 1 and C 2 3 C 2 5 sorry. The applicant is proposing to rezone to a DX 7 then to a business plan development to construct a hotel that is approximately 265 feet tall with ground floor commercial uses.

The applicant will be seeking a 4.5 FAR bonus equating to an approximately two million dollar payment into the neighborhood opportunity bonus fund. We work very closely with the various community groups including on various traffic and circulation concerns and that's resulted in many improvements to the plan including installing left turn left hand turn signals at the intersection of Lake and Halstead as a direct response to community input. Also worked very closely with the Alderman's office on this project.

With that we're available for any questions and appreciate your time and request your favorable recommendation to the City Council. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:22:44 - 2:22:47)
All right Alderman would you like to comment on project?

[Speaker 3] (2:22:49 - 2:22:57)
Thank You Mr. Chairman. Katie I forget how many jobs is going to be created from this construction jobs and in-house jobs.

[Speaker 10] (2:22:58 - 2:23:04)
So we anticipate approximately 900 construction jobs and 300 permanent jobs.

[Speaker 3] (2:23:04 - 2:24:57)
So about 1,200 jobs are going to be generated from this project. They're working very closely with the community. We did have a community meeting and from that community meeting we have some postponement until they were able to adjust some things for two of the community organizations.

They met with the West Loopgate, West Central and also now three community organizations. They also were encouraged to meet with the adjacent neighbors on Green Street to work out any challenges that they had and they worked those things out. I appreciate it.

They also had to have a special meeting with Transportation because their egress was coming out of an alley that's coming out of Halstead Street and and they worked that out. At these community meetings Mr. Chairman folks were concerned about traffic and density in the community. I encouraged the Department of Transportation to do a study to see if we could possibly get the Lake Street Airstop back open at Lake and Halstead.

So Gia the Department of Transportation is doing a study right now with CTA to see if it's viable. We have a lot of density coming to this community. As you can see this one development is paying two million dollars to the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund.

There's a large vacant lot across the street from this that will also generate some density whether it's offices and or residential and that would also be generating more than this building would to the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund and taxes to the City of Chicago. We appreciate the developer doing everything that they've done to work with myself and the community and also Department of Transportation and Planning. I ask for the committee's support on this development.

[Speaker 1] (2:24:59 - 2:25:19)
Thank you. Alderman questions for the Alderman or the applicant? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move to pass on this item?

Alderman Dowell moves to pass on this item as revised. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Opinion Chair the ayes have it and this item is passed as revised.

[Speaker 3] (2:25:19 - 2:25:28)
Also I just want to mention for the record Mr. Chairman that the contractor would be joint venturing with African-American contractors and we appreciate that.

[Speaker 1] (2:25:28 - 2:25:56)
Thank you congratulations Alderman. All right middle of page 13 item number 20169 again in the 27th Ward the ordinance was referred on September 18th of 2019 and the common address 400 North Aberdeen change request M21 and M23 light industry districts to a DX5 downtown mixed-use district and then to a business plan development.

[Speaker 10] (2:25:59 - 2:26:29)
Thank you again good afternoon Mr. Chairman and members of the committee for the record my name is Katie Jankydale from the law firm of DLA Piper. We represent Trammell Crowe Chicago Development Inc. the applicant for this matter.

I'm joined today by representatives from the applicant architect and traffic consultant team. Again as a preliminary matter this matter or this item was considered and recommended for approval at the January 23rd 2020 Planning Commission hearing. We would request that the committee incorporate that record into the record.

[Speaker 1] (2:26:31 - 2:26:43)
So Alderman Scott Wogstack moves to incorporate the records from the Planning Commission all those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

Hearing none the ayes have it records are incorporated continue. Thank you.

[Speaker 10] (2:26:43 - 2:28:03)
The property is on the north side of Kinsey between Aberdeen and May and currently zoned M21 and M23 light industry district. The applicant proposes a DX5 and then a business plan development in order to construct a 16-story commercial building with 150 accessory parking spaces. It will be utilizing the neighborhood opportunity bonus to achieve an additional 2.85 FAR equating to an approximately 3.6 million dollar payment into the bonus fund. It is also subject to the industrial corridor conversion fee and will be making a payment of approximately six hundred and seventy thousand dollars into that fund. In addition based on feedback from the community on this and other projects they will be participating in the area-wide Metra upgrade signal crossing upgrade project making a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar contribution towards those crossing upgrades and then as a result of community feedback from neighbors in particular to the north we will be putting three hundred thousand dollars towards a new traffic signal at the intersection of Grand and May. Again we've worked very closely with the various community groups in on this project as well as the Alderman's office.

We are available for any questions but respectfully request your favorable recommendation of this matter. Thank you.

[Speaker 3] (2:28:05 - 2:28:55)
Alderman Burnett. Thank you Mr. Chairman. In this instance this developer have met with four community organizations and usually three.

Some residents from the from the north were concerned about traffic and parking and all of those things and so we had them to go meet with the residents to work out any challenges that they have. They got the majority of the residents to support them even though this is across the tracks away from the residential but they worked it out they offered them they committed to putting money for the stoplight over there we appreciate that 3.1 million dollars is going to the neighborhood opportunity fund. Katie can you tell me how many jobs are going to be generated here?

[Speaker 6] (2:29:01 - 2:29:15)
Yes Johnny Carlson with Trammell Crow thank you for your time. Construction jobs are going to be approximately a thousand during an 18 to 21 month construction duration. Once the project is open it'll house over 2,000 jobs once it's open and running as an office building.

[Speaker 3] (2:29:15 - 2:30:10)
So we're talking about 3,000 jobs for the city of Chicago 3.1 million dollars to the neighborhood opportunity fund. Working with the community they they worked on the the perimeter of the property to put up some artwork widen the sidewalk make it aesthetically pleasing and open to the public as far as open space goes we really appreciate it. This developer has just built a building down the street on Ogden and Carroll and they actually already have a large tech tech company moving into that building we anticipate that this is going to be a tech building also and we're just helping to bring jobs and jobs to the city of Chicago with that we ask for for the committee support on this project.

[Speaker 1] (2:30:12 - 2:30:25)
Other questions comments no wonder we increased the neighborhood opportunity fund from 12 to 30 thank you Alderman. Because we getting all this money. I wanted to I wanted to move north and everything is south southwest okay.

[Speaker 3] (2:30:25 - 2:30:27)
There's a lot of community meetings Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:30:27 - 2:30:36)
I know you're out every night I know that. And I get beat up at every one of them it's not easy. And to reaffirm this is complete office no residential.

[Speaker 37] (2:30:36 - 2:30:37)
Correct.

[Speaker 1] (2:30:38 - 2:30:39)

And Mr. Chairman I would be remiss if I did not say their contractor is also working with the community they're going to have a joint contract with an African-American contractor and they're going to be hiring people from the neighborhood and they have a good track record for doing that.

[Speaker 1] (2:31:21 - 2:31:21)
Alderman Dowell.

[Speaker 32] (2:31:21 - 2:31:28)

Seeing sure the ayes have it and this item is passed as revised. Thank you very much. All right staying in the 27th Ward item number two zero zero seven one in the 27th Ward ordinance was referred on July 24th of 19 and the common address is 1230 West Augusta Boulevard change request m33 heavy industry district to a b22 neighborhood mixed-use district.

All right good morning Fred.

[Speaker 35] (2:32:28 - 2:33:03)
Good afternoon Ashley. Good afternoon Fred Augustin the attorney on this matter. I'm here today on behalf of the applicant Chris Litwin.

Here with me this afternoon is the applicant's wife Haruka Litwin. The applicant owns the property at 1230 West Augusta. It's currently approved with a two and a half story single-family residence.

Mr. Chairman this property was located in North Branch Industrial Corridor. As a result we did present this project before the Chicago Plan Commission on January 23rd. Plan Commission approved the project and I would like to incorporate the Plan Commission's findings and decisions in today's record.

[Speaker 1] (2:33:04 - 2:33:13)
So Alderman Wagesbeck moves to incorporate the records from the Plan Commission. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? The ayes have it. Records are incorporated.

Continue.

[Speaker 35] (2:33:14 - 2:33:41)
Okay and we are here seeking rezoning from the current m33 heavy industry district to a b22 neighborhood mixed-use district. The existing home will remain. The reason for the zoning change is to allow the renovation and proposed additions to the existing home.

We have worked with Alderman Burnett and his office on this matter. We have also presented the project before the neighbors of River West. All were in support.

We're here to answer any questions the committee may have.

[Speaker 3] (2:33:42 - 2:34:21)
Alderman Burnett. Thank You Mr. Chairman. As the council said he has met with me at a community meeting with the neighbors of River West.

This is a resident that's just trying to you know renovate their property and stay in the community. They just happen to be in the area in the area that's zoned industrial and his grandfathered in and in order to do anything they have to do this. We appreciate them staying in the community and not moving and we we all want them to have a bigger place for the bigger family that they're going to have.

So we're in support of this project.

[Speaker 1] (2:34:22 - 2:35:32)
Thank you Alderman. We have questions for the Alderman or the applicants. Hearing none, I get a motion.

Alderman Wagesbeck moves this item passed. Moves this item as revised. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? Hearing none, the ayes have it.

Item is passed as revised. Thank you. Thank you for staying in the neighborhood.

Great neighborhood. All right. Every neighborhood is great.

Maria, every neighborhood is great. All righty. Next on page 14.

We're still in the 27th ward and this item is 20058. The ordinance was referred on June 12th of 19 and the common address is 1400 through 1410 West Randolph. Change request C13 neighborhood commercial district to a DX7 downtown mixed-use district and then to a residential business plan development.

Good afternoon. Thank you for being patient.

[Speaker 37] (2:35:34 - 2:35:34)
Counselor?

[Speaker 2] (2:35:34 - 2:36:53)
Thank you. Good afternoon Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. Once more for the record, my name is Sarah Barnes and I'm an attorney with the Law Offices of Sandbanks located at 221 Northwest South Street.

Before we begin, I believe do we have some slides that gives the committee an idea of this building. It truly is quite exciting and towards that I'm happy to be here this afternoon on behalf of the applicant MP Randolph LLC. Here with me on behalf of the applicant is Gabrielle Gambino-Leon seated to my right as well as Chris Hume on the far right and then we have our project architect Jeremiah DeMoss from Brennan School in Lynch.

Before I begin and continue Mr. Chairman and as an initial matter we appeared in support of this project in front of the Chicago Plan Commission at their public hearing on January 23rd, 2020. Pursuant to this matter was considered and recommended for approval by the Chicago Plan Commission on that day. As such I do request that a copy of the transcript as well as all corresponding exhibits be adopted into the record here today.

[Speaker 1] (2:36:55 - 2:37:01)
Alderman Lopez moves to incorporate the records from the Plan Commission. All those in favor? Aye.

[Speaker 34] (2:37:04 - 2:37:10)
I'm sorry, I just wanted to clarify there should be a substitute that goes to DX 5 correct?

[Speaker 2] (2:37:10 - 2:37:13)
Yeah. Okay I was gonna get there. We'll do that next.

[Speaker 34] (2:37:13 - 2:37:14)
Okay can we get a copy of it too?

[Speaker 2] (2:37:15 - 2:37:16)
Oh yeah, sorry.

[Speaker 1] (2:37:17 - 2:37:42)
Okay and then we're going to have another substitute. Okay great. Okay so Alderman Lopez is, are we going to do this together?

Yeah, Alderman Lopez moves to incorporate the records from the Plan Commission. All those in favor? Aye.

Opposed? Hearing none, the records are incorporated. Continue.

[Speaker 2] (2:37:43 - 2:38:45)
Thank you and similarly and towards that same end, prior to the Plan Commission hearing as well as this hearing today, we did prepare and submit a substitute ordinance with regard to this matter. The original ordinance called for a change in the underlying zoning from a C13 to a DX7 and then to the residential business plan development through some very quality and meaningful work with the relevant community groups as well as the Department of Planning and Development. We decided that the DX7 was not necessary and was not as conforming with the adjacent neighborhood and as such we reduced that underlying zoning to a DX5.

So the substitute ordinance reflects the change in the underlying zoning from a C13 to a DX5 and then to the proposed residential business plan development. So I do ask that the substitute ordinance also be adopted into the record here today.

[Speaker 1] (2:38:46 - 2:38:50)
So are we, are we okay with that?

[Speaker 2] (2:38:56 - 2:39:11)
A hard copy. Yeah I was emailed so I will deliver a paper copy to the Department of Planning and Development following this hearing. You got it.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:39:12 - 2:39:24)
Okay so Alderman Lopez moves to accept the substitute ordinance. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Hearing none, the ayes have it, substitute is accepted.

[Speaker 2] (2:39:25 - 2:39:25)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:39:25 - 2:39:28)
So we are going from a C13 to a DX5.

[Speaker 2] (2:39:29 - 2:39:31)
Underlying yep and then to the plan development.

[Speaker 1] (2:39:32 - 2:39:33)
Okay continue.

[Speaker 2] (2:39:33 - 2:39:57)
Thank you and that should take care of the housekeeping matters. However as a matter of background since this is such an interesting project, it's going to be the first high-rise that is at the far west end of the West Loop neighborhood. Towards that end, oh are we okay?

[Speaker 37] (2:39:57 - 2:39:58)
Yeah we're okay.

[Speaker 2] (2:39:59 - 2:47:29)
Towards that end with regards to the developer Marquette companies, this company was founded by its principal Darren Flaminger who actually got his start in affordable housing and then he went on to found a mission, find a mission down in Nicaragua, Nicaragua with his wife where they build schools and community centers throughout the country and towards that end that is actually why Darren could not be here today because he is down in Nicaragua. Marquette companies acquired this property along with a couple of other adjacent properties over the past several years because they did want to, they found that there was residential and retail life kind of lacking from the west end of the West Loop where the entire east end of the West Loop was really invigorating and robust. So towards that end a few years ago Marquette companies redeveloped the site at 180 at North Ada which is just behind the subject site with a residential building and then just a couple months ago we were before this board on a companion development or sister development which is across the street from the subject property on the northwest corner of Randolph and Ada where they are proposing a mid-rise residential building right across from Union Park.

This is kind of the finale of that and you'll see from the records the proposal calls for the construction of a new 25 story tower at the northeast corner of Randolph and Ogden. This will be a mixed-use development so that there will be three large retail spaces at grade level. The intent with those retail spaces is to replace the existing, some of the existing restaurants that will be removed in order to allow for this development and also to bring some new retail vitality and restaurants into again that kind of sleepy part of the ward or neighborhood.

Towards that same end there will be three floors of parking for a total of a hundred and eight on-site parking spaces and the overall development will contain a total of 281 dwelling units that will be located on and between the fourth and 25th floor. There will be a residential amenity floor on the 18th floor that will include a pool, fitness center, deck, terrace, etc. There will also be multiple levels of outdoor space for the residents of the building.

Towards this end we are excited to report that this proposal did receive an FAR bonus. As a result the applicant will be contributing over 1.2 million dollars into the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund. As well the applicant has agreed to start a scholarship fund with the local community to get students into some of the colleges that serve the 27th Ward.

And lastly and towards additional community benefits the applicant is also working with the Union Park Advisory Council towards certain improvements to the public park that is across the street. As well and with regard to affordable housing, this as indicated the total number of units for this proposal is 281. As a result the applicant is providing 56 new affordable units with some work with Alderman Burnett as well as the Department of Housing.

The applicant will be providing 28 of those units which is 10% of the 20% about half on site in the new building. And then there will be in the other half of that 28 units being located off-site within the Illinois Medical District. The importance of that is because a lot of people ask why why don't you put everything on site?

I think this is a unique situation in that the applicant has the opportunity to kind of spread the love so to speak. I commend Alderman Burnett for pioneering the affordable ordinance and then for championing it throughout the West Loop. West Loop probably has hundreds if not thousands of affordable housing units now and that is as a result of Alderman Burnett's incredible effort to champion that as well as all of the new and exciting development that is going on in the West Loop.

Unfortunately some of the adjacent neighborhoods have not yet gotten the benefits of all of the new construction and as a result there are some depletions in affordable housing in the adjacent neighborhoods even though they are neighborhoods where people desire to be and end or stay and are being outpriced. So this provides an opportunity to get affordable housing into other parts of this neighborhood that really really need it. And towards that same end the affordable units that will be located off-site are intended to serve the students and medical residents of the IMD as well as families who may have loved ones that are in a long-term treatment within the hospitals that make up part of the IMD.

So I think this is a truly exceptional affordable project. Lastly with regard to jobs which I know is another important benefit with all of these new developments the applicant anticipates producing 300 over 375 construction jobs as well as between 30 and 60 full-time jobs in the new building between the retail and the residential services. Lastly with regard to community review we started this project back in May of 2019.

We have met with the West Loop community organization as well as the West Central Association and the neighbors of West Loop. We've actually met with those different groups over seven times throughout this process. As a result of that ongoing review I think we ended up with a much better project so we thank them for their time as well and then we also held a public meeting where the alderman was in attendance.

We do have the support of all of those varying community groups and with that we hopefully have the support of Alderman Burnett as well as this committee and we would be very happy to answer any questions that you may have.

[Speaker 1] (2:47:32 - 2:47:43)
A very lengthy presentation I might add so why don't we why don't we I know you're excited as we are however let's hear from the most excitable person in the room Alderman Walter Burnett.

[Speaker 3] (2:47:44 - 2:49:40)
Thank you very much Mr. Chairman so as the councilor said she did meet with all of the community organizations. One she didn't add she met with the Union Park Advisory Council also which had input which is west of there and and they they negotiated to they actually this developer has actually adopted the park so he's not just doing a one-off with the park he's doing several other things with the park and with the scholarship program so we appreciate that. After we had our initial community meeting in between time we had got the new commissioner and then the new commissioner came in actually had them to redesign their their development and change the massing of it and which was some of the concerns from the community meeting and which turned out to be a better project more more very nice project and they also negotiated with myself and also with Commissioner Navarro in the Department of Housing for the tent on and a tent off was going to be putting housing on the west side coincidentally Mr. Chairman members of the committee out west we get a lot of a lot of folks from the medical district who go to school over there from UIC and also Rush Hospital that live throughout the west side actually and they need affordable housing also along with other residents so this is a win-win for the city 1.1 point 1 million dollars toward the neighborhood opportunity fund 300 drop three over 300 jobs to the community in this contractor that they're using is also partnering with an african-american contractor as a joint venture so we see this as a win-win community supported we support it and we ask for this body's support also thank

[Speaker 1] (2:49:40 - 2:50:49)

[Speaker 1] (2:51:18 - 2:51:29)
record Alderman Lopez moves to incorporate the records from the Plan Commission all those in favor aye any opposed the ayes have it and the

[Speaker 17] (2:51:29 - 2:53:52)
records are incorporated continue thank you I'm joined by representatives of the project team and the operator Drive Shack this morning and the architects and other consultants so they will be available for questions as you noted the the current zoning of the site is c3 three and c3 one split the proposal is to zone it to a unified c3 three and then to a business waterway planned development because it is along the river in order to redevelop it with and it is the former site of Vienna beef and it will be redeveloped with a three story best-in-class recreational entertainment venue that's focused on a high technology driving range and simulator it would include approximately 102 climate controlled hitting bays each with food and beverage services restaurant and spectator space and also flexible meeting and event spaces Drive Shack is an owner and operator of golf related leisure and entertainment businesses throughout the country and they're based in New York the proposed development would contain all all weather hitting bays on three levels and as shown on the site plan the building on the west side of the site would have would have cutting-edge technology with interactive and entertainment experiences as a waterway plan development the project will comply with the Chicago River design guidelines and the North Branch framework plan the development will include a 30-foot setback from the river and a publicly accessible river walk the river edge is proposed to be activated with a multimodal path a seating and gathering spaces a plaza native plantings lighting and bike racks accessible ramps will be provided at both ends of the walk the applicant proposed presented the proposed development at community meetings with the Bucktown Community Organization and then a larger community meeting convened by all of them in the wagons pack also met with the Audubon Society in the Urban Wildlife Institute to ensure that the building or the facility will be safe for wildlife in conclusion the alderman has worked closely with alderman wagons pack and the community and the Department of Planning and Development on this project it's our understanding that alderman wagons pack is in support of the project and has provided a letter of support to the committee and our team is available to answer any questions that the

[Speaker 1] (2:53:52 - 2:54:09)
committee may have yes thank you um Alderman wagons pack is here I know on this exciting project let me hear from you yep chairman I think you have a

[Speaker 6] (2:54:09 - 2:56:19)
letter of support that we had sent along but this was a somewhat complicated but an interesting project for the community most of that area in this in the surrounding there is commercial and industrial use still so this is pretty far away from any residents although we did meet with all the residents in the area had a couple of community meetings and if you look at the building itself the building is low level three stories it is just east of the Damon Bridge so the Damon Bridge over the river actually it runs over that it doesn't run over the top of it it's actually higher than the buildings this is an interesting use for the area but at our community meetings we didn't have any neighbors who are opposed to it they wanted to make sure though that issues like lighting and noise control were taken into consideration which the applicants did very well you heard that they met with Audubon Society they actually met with them before we even talked to them so I was happy to hear that they're taking into consideration issues with the impact on the netting and along the river they came back and worked on additional aspects of the of the river walk there and improved that I think we talked about reducing some of the parking and trying to make more accessible publicly accessible green space so I was happy with the way they approached this we had a related ordinance and transportation committee on Tuesday to the Vienna property and in the comment that came up there was Vienna did move from this facility they are moving they moved to the 11th Ward for the manufacturing process and I think the 27th Ward if I'm not mistaken in Alderman Burnett's area for their offices at 2501 West Fulton so I'm in support of this project the community is and we hope it's successful in bringing jobs and activity to this intersection

[Speaker 1] (2:56:19 - 2:56:24)
thank you all right questions for the Alderman or the applicant yes all the

[Speaker 12] (2:56:24 - 2:56:44)
men Brendan Riley thank you chairman I just had two questions and obviously I have total faith in Alderman Wagesbeck for vetting this properly I was curious though in testimony was mentioned that their protections being put in place for wildlife briefly could you explain what that means because I didn't realize

[Speaker 24] (2:56:44 - 2:57:27)
there was a an issue here I answer it it was also Miranda real estate development for dry shack so the netting that is actually the netting that's actually used for this facility is polyester the netting is actually so tightly woven it's about the size of a penny so birds if they were to actually hit the netting would actually bounce off they're not going to get entangled that being said we've actually taken meetings with the Audubon Society the Urban Life Wild Institute sorry the Urban Wildlife Institute and plan to have a standard operating procedure with a plan of action with the Chicago bird

[Speaker 12] (2:57:27 - 2:57:55)
collision monitors okay thank you and then the the second question just because I know it's it's a going concern here is related to traffic circulation it appears to me looking at your site plan you've internalized a lot of that but if you could speak to that briefly I know that that's been a constant headache in this particular neighborhood for a very long time so Peter Lemon with

[Speaker 33] (2:57:55 - 2:58:59)
Kim Lee horn we prepared the traffic study related to the project so the project was like most you know reviewed and approved by CDOT the site actually eliminates a driveway that currently exists on Elston the city a couple years back realigned Elston through this area it actually create you know it was done to address kind of pre-existing traffic issue it created some excess capacity at these intersections and so while they are still busy the traffic is able to be handled during the peak hours the site also should notice tends to focus its peak more on the evening so kind of post evening rush doesn't generate a lot of weekday peak hour traffic also we looked at Saturday evenings and afternoons and when the site is actually busiest and the background volumes are actually lower there so while we have heavier heavier site traffic we actually have lower background ambient traffic volumes and then the site uses the existing driveway that's there today that was contemplated as part of the Elston realignment so that driveway aligns with the development that will be

[Speaker 12] (2:58:59 - 2:59:09)
had between Fullerton and Elston very good thank you well that answers my questions chairman congratulations Alderman thank you Alderman Waguespan

[Speaker 6] (2:59:09 - 2:59:46)
the issues with a big site like this was the access as Peter mentioned and we did we are closing off a couple of the access points which in the original plans were you know CDOT kind of said hey let's leave them open the original plans going back to other retail and commercial uses but by reducing the number of access points we're reducing the especially at the corner Damon Elston Fullerton taking those out will reduce a lot of the car traffic that comes into the intersection a mere 15 feet away from the intersection so we're

[Speaker 1] (2:59:46 - 3:00:45)
hoping that that helps thank you Alderman other questions if not can I get a motion to move to pass by Alderman Brendan Riley it moves to pass as revised all those in favor aye any opposed opinion chair the ayes have it and will be passed as revised thank you thank you very much and we have one item on what we first of all we have Alderman we're going back we're going back to the regular agenda for an aldermanic and that's probably page two I think right all right so pop top of page two and this item is a eight five one four first ward ordinance referred on December 18th of 19 common address 1317 through 1333 Northwestern Avenue and the change request b33 community shopping district to a c1 to neighborhood commercial district yes so very briefly spot oh

[Speaker 27] (3:00:45 - 3:01:43)
sorry thank you chairman so very briefly this is essentially resetting what was a lapsed type 1 zone it may was made clear to us by the previous developer it was a project that was not moving forward they were not going to get the construction financing they were walking away so this is essentially restoring the zoning map as is there's a lot of c1 I think it's we're doing c1 dash 3 zoning in this space there's two thank you for so much which matches the interests of our neighbors in Humboldt Park and with the Wicker Park community they definitely want to see street level commercial there but they also wanted to be thoughtful about the amount of density the height that we're approving so c1 dash 2 for this space felt like the appropriate move and so that's we really

[Speaker 1] (3:01:43 - 3:03:05)
hope for the committee back to neighborhood planning okay great all right questions for the alderman hearing none can I get a motion to move this item moved by Alderman Brendan Riley move to pass all those in favor aye any opposed the chair the ayes have it item is passed thanks for your patience alderman we have a couple more items and then we've got to revisit something so we're now in the with in the 40th Ward what page are we on all right page 15 all right this is in document number 201 47 40th Ward ordinance referred on September 18th of 19 common address 51 36 through 38 North Claremont change request is from an rs3 residential single-unit detached house district to an rm 4.5 multi-unit yeah for the for the benefit of the committee members this was a public testimony by one of the neighbors I believe in the area felt generally that it was inconsistent with the surrounding zoning of rs3 so with that let's start to hear some testimony good afternoon mr.

[Speaker 22] (3:03:05 - 3:04:53)
chairman members of the board my name is John Pekarsky I'm an attorney with offices at 25 East Washington and I have with me mr.

[Speaker 1] (3:04:53 - 3:06:37)
heard we have a witness here that was opposed to this was he aware of the of this yes okay we do have a letter of or at least we have an email of sorts that we do have a letter of support from the alderman Vasquez after this restrictive covenant is in there as obviously you you know restrictive covenants are private events that can be enforced by the alderman and or the community group correct for the record all right questions from many members hearing none alderman Lopez moves to pass on this item all those in favor aye any opposed can you share the ayes have it and the item is passed thank you very much all right and I know our gentleman is still there you might wonder if you haven't already had a conversation with him great okay now we are going to the addendum to the deferred agenda it was February 13th of 2020 I'm going to bring up this item number 2030 to t1 in the 35th Ward ordinance was referred on December 18th of 19 and the common address is 3863 through 3909 North Drake Avenue and the change request is an rs3 residential single-unit detached house district and a c11 neighborhood commercial district to a b2 to neighborhood mixed-use district proceed good afternoon mr.

[Speaker 8] (3:06:37 - 3:07:58)
chairman and members of the board one last time my name is Daniel box I'm an attorney with the law offices of Sam banks located at 2 to 1 North LaSalle I'm here today on behalf of the applicant 3863 North Drake LLC unfortunately mr. Bilken 40 who's the manager that LLC was unable to attend today the applicant owns the subject property located at 3863 through 3909 North Drake the property is currently improved with three multi-unit buildings the applicant is proposing to raise the existing structures and to develop the subject property with two new three story townhome buildings containing a total of ten townhome units both buildings will measure 33 feet 1.25 inches in height and each unit will be supported by two off-street parking garage spaces the subject property is currently split zoned so in order to permit the project the applicant is seeking a zoning change from an rs3 residential single-unit detached house district and c11 neighborhood commercial district to a b2 to neighborhood mixed-use district we have worked with the local community and alderman on this project I know I just handed over a letter of support for the project with that I'm happy to answer any questions you might have all right so that's all

[Speaker 1] (3:07:58 - 3:08:21)
the men Ramirez we do have a you have indication of his support questions from committee members hearing none alderman Walter Burnett moves to pass on this item all those in favor aye any opposed being sure the ayes have it item is passed thank you just question affordability in here or what I believe

[Speaker 8] (3:08:21 - 3:08:33)
so you just get back yeah let me go ahead and do that all right hold on a

[Speaker 1] (3:08:33 - 3:09:37)
second hold on hold on so our first item that we passed out of committee was a series of recommendations to the building code that were that was asked by Alderman Lopez if these were technical in nature typos etc etc and upon a further investigation it was probably more substantive than typos so what what we want to do I know that they've the Commissioner has been working with answering all the questions and such what I want to do though is that we would hold this we passed it out of committee but I want to hold it and I want to hold it until there's satisfaction from the from the members of the committee so hopefully we can get this done in short order but I'm gonna I'm gonna hold this until I hear from the alderman about some of the questions I know that there's was there 18 or 19 all of them Lopez Thank You chairman there

[Speaker 31] (3:09:37 - 3:10:13)
were 19 non-technical non-typo related amendments in this substitute technical corrections ordinance ranging from issues regarding whether or not a single access for basement apartments was new or not all the way to multiple requests from the fire department a couple examples we heard earlier stairwells and such and I think that they are more than just typos to deserve a deeper dive and I appreciate your effort to ensure that we are all on the same page so that nothing feels like it's being snuck into the last minute Alderman you were very

[Speaker 1] (3:10:13 - 3:10:26)
clear in your testimony at the beginning of the meeting so I know that you will be satisfied Alderman Beal thank you mr.

[Speaker 30] (3:10:26 - 3:11:38)
chairman mr. chairman I just wanted to also piggyback on my colleague who was very clear about these correction technical corrections it has always been my knowledge that any typo or correction would go to the Rules Committee as clarification and the fact that these corrections will come to this committee leads me to believe that they knew that these were some amendment to some ordinances to you know kind of circumvent the process and when you look at it I mean the one that really stood out is the ingress and egress on a ground-floor apartment that's a public safety issue I mean who would not want an ingress and egress on a garden unit apartment for the sake of public safety in an event that there was an emergency or a fire or something like that and we're gonna take that away so you know I commend my colleague and I think we need to really hold this and look at it and scrub it because I think that there was I think this was deliberate I don't think it was an accident thank you

[Speaker 1] (3:11:38 - 3:12:02)
Alderman Beal so with that with the with those instructions to me as the chairman before we bring presented to the City Council with that I think Alderman Burnett has a motion to adjourn all those in favor aye meeting is adjourned thank you very much
