Good morning.

[Speaker 42] (19:04 - 19:13)
Everyone would please take your seats. The committee will come to order.

[Speaker 1] (19:16 - 19:57)
Good morning. It is 10.15 a.m. on September 17th. The chamber will come to order.

Please take a seat. Pipe down. Let's go.

The meeting of the Chicago City Council Committee on Zoning Landmarks and Building Standards is called to order. We'll start off with a roll call. Alderman Spada.

Alderman Villegas. Alderman Riley. Alderman Knudsen.

Alderman Clay. Vice Chair Lawson is present. No.

[Speaker 44] (20:58 - 20:59)
Sorry.

[Speaker 1] (20:59 - 21:01)
I don't know how we missed this. Who are we missing?

[Speaker 45] (21:07 - 21:10)
We don't have a short one.

[Speaker 1] (21:12 - 26:48)
My apologies. We're a short one member that will be here shortly. We'll recess for just five minutes.

Thank you. The committee will come back to order. For the purposes of quorum, we've been joined by Alderman Deal.

That gives us a quorum. Alders, Villegas, Conway, Cruz, and Moore have requested to attend this meeting by remote means under the provisions of Rule 59 due to unrelated circumstances. Alderperson Fuentes makes the motion to approve the alder's request.

All in favor say aye. Any opposed say nay. The ayes have it.

Welcome alders. Moving on. I will now read the items to be deferred.

I will read the page number and the description, and then I take a motion for all at the end. On page one, document number 02024-0010982 regarding the designation of alternates to the Zoning Board of Appeals. On page two, Western Avenue Corridor Map Amendments, A8900 and A8891.

Moving on to page 11, file number 22520-T1 for the address commonly known as 1150 West Diversity Parkway, noting that the item has been withdrawn by the applicant. Now we have all of page 20, including document number 02024-0010959 regarding dynamic sign messages. File 22499 for the address commonly known as 6240-250 North Broadway.

File number 22524-T1 for the address commonly known as 4920 North Sheridan Road. File number 22493 for the address commonly known as 909-931 West Belmont Avenue. All of page 21, including file 22508 for the address commonly known as 935 West Webster Avenue, file 22494 for the address commonly known as 4959 North Augusta Boulevard, and file 22491 for the address commonly known as 37 South Sangamon.

Lastly, all of page 22, including file number 22497 for the address commonly known as 200-222 West 89th Street, and file number 22522 for the address commonly known as 3317 South Morgan. I have no questions by committee members. I'll declare and make a motion to defer the previously listed items.

All in favor say aye. Any opposed say nay. The ayes have it and the items are deferred.

At this time, we will begin the public comment period. The public comment period will be limited to 30 minutes out of respect for everyone's time. We had a number of people sign up.

Bear with us. We're going to do 15 speakers. We tried to get as many of the topics as folks signed up because the order was a bit off.

They're all going to get two minutes. I apologize if we cut anybody off, but we do want to hear from as many folks as possible. Yes, Alderman Beall.

[Speaker 20] (26:50 - 27:04)
Based on the number of people that I see in the gallery, the chairman has the discretion to allow as many speakers as possible and it does not have to be limited to 30 minutes. I would make the recommendation that you allow people to speak.

[Speaker 1] (27:09 - 27:33)
Certainly. The number would be overwhelming if we gave them all one minute, to be honest. I'm willing to add a chamber will come to order.

I would be willing to add another five speakers for two minutes. We're not going to do three hours of public comment.

[Speaker 20] (27:34 - 28:05)
Mr. Chairman, let me just say when you have people that take off from work and go out of their way to come down here to be heard, I think it's our duty and obligation to hear as many people as we possibly can. I've always said I've always disagreed with limiting public testimony, Mr. Chairman, because years ago we would be here until 10, 11 o'clock at night sometimes hearing people out. That's just my recommendation, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (28:05 - 28:16)
Alderman Beall, I appreciate that. The chair does not have the authority to extend that 30-minute time per Rule 58.

[Speaker 20] (28:17 - 28:24)
Mr. Chairman, it's the discretion of the chair. Alderman Beall, I got you. You know I love you.

I want to feel it.

[Speaker 1] (28:24 - 28:36)
I do want to get more people in today. We've got a lot of people that have come here and we appreciate that. We have a lot of items on the agenda.

That's why I've added more people with a little bit less time so we can hear as many things as we can.

[Speaker 2] (28:38 - 29:35)
Thank you, Chairman. I'd also like to second Alderman Beall's. I also want to make sure and make it clear and abundantly clear that it's important to give voice to the people.

As chair of the Housing Committee, I have extended public comment for an hour with the Chicago Housing Authority because many people wanted to speak. I also think it's particularly important because in these council chambers, as people oftentimes say, that we need to make sure that all the persons are given the courtesy to vote on local matters. There is an attempt today to defer an item in the 25th Ward.

I appreciate your sentiment. I'm not sharing my sentiment. It has been a clear and always honest conversation in terms of the item that I have for years.

I think it is a shame that they are holding items that have the community support and the Aldermanic support using all the Aldermen as sponsors.

[Speaker 1] (29:36 - 29:49)
I would like people to speak. You're out of order. I've made my decision.

We're doing 30 minutes of public comment. I have 15 speakers. First up is Stephen Vance followed by Tawan Sims for two minutes each.

[Speaker 47] (30:04 - 31:47)
I'm ready. Please proceed. Hello.

My name is Stephen Vance. I'm a South Loop renter and a member of Urban Environmentists Illinois. The ordinances to proactively upzone Western Avenue will be voted on today in this committee, although I believe you deferred one of them.

The ordinances will rezone nearly all of the four and a half mile stretch from Addison to Howard to B3-3 zoning, allowing multifamily housing to be built as of right without further approvals from the local Alderperson or this committee. All three of the Alderpersons, Haddon, Vazquez and Martin have given their support to this plan. I also fully support this plan but I believe there is a technical flaw in this plan that could hinder the goal of adding more housing.

To take advantage of the bonuses that the Connected Communities Ordinance offers, those property owners who want to maximize those bonuses and maximize the number of homes that they can build, they would still have to go through a Type 1 zoning map amendment. This would require more meetings and would not achieve the intended effect of cutting the tape to build new housing. I would like City Council members to implement more proactive upzoning across Chicago, including on Western, Milwaukee, Broadway, less busy streets like 35th Street and McKinley Park, but to do so effectively and to maximize the number of homes that we build to achieve housing abundance in this city to lower rents, we need to do more to tweak the Connected Communities Ordinance to eliminate that hurdle to get the Type 1 zoning map amendment. I believe that is something that this body can amend to expedite the construction of more housing in Chicago. Thank you for listening.

I yield my time.

[Speaker 1] (31:50 - 32:00)
Thank you. I'm sorry. We're trying to shuffle some things here.

I don't know who I said was next. Whoever I said. Taiwan Sims, please proceed.

Followed by Mattel.

[Speaker 42] (32:07 - 34:14)
Wasladnia Damaratska. Thank you. When y'all are ready.

There's a great disconnect in this body of people that represent us. I understand this from all the people behind me. It's like Polish, Latino, and a host of other.

But they all divided. And over there are probably the developers that called us clowns. Welcome to the circus.

And it is a circus. But I will say that the actors in this theater right now, all the clowns are on that side over there. And not over here.

It's indecent that y'all would consider the term sacred ground. All of these people that came in and I was here for that meeting. They came in and spoke heartfelt.

Spoke and said, hey, you know what? We want to continue on utilizing our sacred space as a sacred space. Okay, we understand poor people came from over there.

But we want to continue having our church. You can keep looking up there. Keep looking up there for time to go away.

But we're going to hope for you to go away. And this ill representation. The ill representation.

Because you could care less about these people in this room. And you can care less about your other constituents. And that's the heartlessness of you.

So, all these people I'm with y'all, I'll say, because I'm a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ. The only thing I've got in this earth. So I believe that they should have their sacred space.

But I also believe that we should have proper representation in the city of Chicago. Whereas our finance and our education and all other things are considered properly. These people came from spaces off.

Alderman Beal said it. They took off time from work. Why should they have to?

Y'all should consider what we consider. Y'all should take to heart what we take to heart. We shouldn't have to waste our time coming in this room to come to y'all and grovel.

We got to grovel before y'all. Hey! Hey, help us!

Hey! Enough is enough. So, we're considering y'all as ineffective representation.

Enough is enough. Give these people what they ask. That's a little bit y'all can do.

A little bit. Please.

[Speaker 1] (34:14 - 34:20)
Thank you, Mr. Simms. Next, Mrs. Domorowska.

[Speaker 36] (34:21 - 34:30)
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Wladyslawa Domorowska. My friend, she is reading my face.

[Speaker 51] (34:34 - 35:47)
Good morning. Laja has been a resident since 1989 and a St. Adalbert's parishioner since that time. St. Adalbert's has been a place of worship for over 100 years. It is a place of beauty and great importance to the Polish and Mexican communities. Today, we would not be able to build such a remarkable architectural structure with unique exterior and interior. It is a cultural heritage of all Catholics of Chicago.

Granting St. Adalbert's Church the landmark status is extremely important because without it, the Archdiocese of Chicago would leave it to complete devastation. Let me tell you why I think so. This would be the case.

On Sunday, September 15, 2024, I called the police because the door and gate were open in St. Adalbert's Church. I believe that someone did it on purpose to devastate the church because the doors are made of metal and are difficult to open. There was a thick chain and a large padlock on the gate.

I reported to Father Enright that the windows were broken on both sides, but he didn't fix it. I pray for granting St. Adalbert's the landmark status. Thank you for listening to me and God bless America.

[Speaker 1] (35:49 - 35:57)
Thank you very much. Next, we have Candelario Rodriguez who will be followed by Julie Sawicki.

[Speaker 28] (36:06 - 37:54)
This is Deacon Candelario and my name is Donna and I'll be speaking for him. Is that okay? Both residents of the 25th Ward members at St. Paul Church. Today, we come to you telling you that the voices of the community members of the residents and of the parishioners of St. Paul have been ignored. The record that was forwarded to City Council this morning proves that we have been ignored. It doesn't include an expert report that we shared talking about how the St. Adalbert property does not in fact meet the criteria for landmarks as it is written today. It doesn't show the petition of hundreds of parishioners and residents of St. Paul who stand in opposition and it does not include the maps that we shared showing you a scattergram of residents in Pilsen who are against landmarking versus those who are for it and live in the outskirts not only of our community, but of the city. What we are asking as property owners, neighbors burdened and affected by the $1.5 million in costs we have already had to assume for this building is for you to defer the vote because as it is written today, the landmark request, it is not beneficial to the community. It's going to create a burden.

We need a little bit more time. We know we want to work with the city. We know we want to work with the neighbors.

If we can, we know we want to do that. We're asking you to defer. Because you have not received everything that...

[Speaker 1] (37:54 - 37:56)
The chamber will come to order.

[Speaker 28] (37:56 - 37:57)
May I begin again?

[Speaker 1] (37:58 - 38:07)
Excuse me. If you cannot be quiet, you cannot stay here. Please respect the speaker as you would expect anyone to respect every speaker.

Please restore her time and continue.

[Speaker 28] (38:08 - 38:23)
Because you have not received this information, because you have to make a... If you are forced to make a decision today, we are asking you to vote no. And we have been here since 8.15 this morning. Parishioners of St. Paul Church asked for this. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (38:23 - 38:44)
Great. Thank you very much. I'll just point out for committee members, some of the materials she referenced is in your packets.

Not every letter of support that we received, that is emailed. But the heat maps certainly are. If there's any questions on that, let staff know.

Up next is Julie Sawicki, followed by Jimmy Rothschild.

[Speaker 38] (38:45 - 40:48)
Good morning. My name is Julie Sawicki and I am the president of the Society of St. Adalbert's. We formed our organization for the specific purpose of carrying on the Catholic mission of St. Adalbert's and keeping it a Catholic site as it has been for the past 150 years. To correct the former speaker, St. Paul's is not the owner of St. Adalbert's. It is the Archdiocese of Chicago, as we all know. Also, to correct the former speaker, there is a Polish donor who gave $3 million for the repair of the church and other funds were raised, which the Archdiocese of Chicago returned, instead of repairing the church as needed.

Also, I would like to correct the former speaker and remind her that in the landmark commission meeting, it was proven that St. Adalbert's meets four out of the seven criteria for landmarking. Now, to allay any fears, because I have spoken with several aldermen over the past, and I thank you for your time with me. I don't live in your ward, but you opened your door to me and met with me and heard and listened about the St. Adalbert's situation. There is a plan for the long-term future of St. Adalbert's. It is not real estate development. The church cannot survive on its own.

It needs the benefits of the buildings around it in order to survive. We came up with a plan that not only satisfied the Polish community that built it and wants to keep it as Catholic, this is what our ancestors sacrificed for, but it also is sensitive to the needs of the Pilsen community, who has been resisting the pressures of gentrification and do not want to see any type of real estate development here. Our plan is simply to keep the church as a shrine, to convert the convent into a 40-room B&B style retreat house.

We've done a whole business plan for this, and this retreat house will generate sufficient revenue not only to do the repairs, but also to sustain it long-term and build an endowment for the church so that there is money long-term for the church. It's a plan that creates jobs for the community. It's a plan that doesn't disrupt the demographics or population density of the area.

Thank you very much. You'll hear more from me.

[Speaker 1] (40:49 - 41:07)
Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Sawicki. For purposes of the quorum, we've been joined by Alderman Riley and Alderman Ramirez-Rosa.

I know we have non-members, Cardona and Haddon here as well. Next up is Jimmy Rothschild, followed by George Blakemore.

[Speaker 37] (41:10 - 43:14)
Good morning. My name is Jimmy Rothschild. I'm a resident of the 33rd Ward and a staff member at the Jewish Council on Urban Affairs where I support our housing and economic justice work.

Our organization is now in its 60th year of fighting against displacement and for housing justice and affordability. The Northwest Preservation Ordinance that's before you today fits squarely in that mission. Every time a three-flat home is torn down or gutted, that's three families that are gutted as well.

Their relationships that keep them rooted and safe are disrupted as they're forced from their homes and out of their neighborhoods. In gentrifying neighborhoods like Logan Square, in Albany Park where I live, in Uptown where I rented in such a three-flat for many years, I've seen how this process harms our neighbors and our neighborhoods, making them more expensive, less diverse, and less vibrant. When families are forced out, so are their local culture, their knowledge, their relationships, their businesses, etc.

Making it more expensive for developers to do this will keep more of that affordable housing in our neighborhoods. It will keep people in their homes and making it easier for tenants to buy their own buildings will reverse those harmful trends, making people more rooted in their neighborhoods, not less. In order for this to be effective, those fees need to be high enough to make a meaningful disincentive on that harmful development and make it a significant support for those tenants seeking to buy those homes.

That's why the $20,000 or $60,000 fee is necessary. Many of JCOA's members are immigrants or the children and grandchildren of immigrants and refugees. My grandmother was a refugee and when she landed in South Shore, a multifamily unit like this allowed her parents to put down roots that have kept this family vibrant in the city for five generations.

We need this in Logan and we need this beyond in Albany Park and Uptown and South Shore and everywhere where people are forced from their homes.

[Speaker 1] (43:15 - 43:23)
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Rothschild. We have George Blakemore followed by Ana Leija.

[Speaker 40] (43:26 - 45:27)
George Blakemore. The church is the her and bride of Christ. The Catholic diocese have failed to protect this church from a landmark historical church.

What's going on now is that the whites are moving back to Pillsbury. They're moving in and now they're going to move the Hispanics out. And the orphan is a part of the problem.

I was appalled to hear that this man up here, whatever he is, call himself the chairman. If it's a hundred people that come out, you're getting paid to sit on your way and listen to that hundred. If it takes all day or all night, because you are a public servant.

You are a public servant. So the reason why this goes on in the city of Chicago, because it's a one-party system. What's that one party?

The Democrats. The Democrats machine. Did you slate this man?

The machine says vote for the donkey and you vote. It's no two-party. It's worse than communist Russia or fascist Germany.

A one-party system. So the system now is turning on you, you, and you. And you can change this.

You can vote them all out. All of them. In these communities that have these public meetings, if it's 50 people show up, if it's a hundred, they let them all speak.

And what you get paid, old servant, is a stick. You can't get paid a stick. You can ask how many you want for a stick.

[Speaker 1] (45:31 - 45:33)
Thank you, Mr. Blackburn.

[Speaker 40] (45:37 - 45:39)
Up next, it's Ana Leija.

[Speaker 1] (45:43 - 45:47)
One sec. One sec.

[Speaker 40] (45:48 - 45:48)
Good morning.

[Speaker 1] (45:49 - 45:52)
Mr. Blackburn, thank you. Please proceed.

[Speaker 39] (45:52 - 45:59)
Good morning. Honorable older women and older men of the Committee on Zoning, Landmarks, and Building Standards.

[Speaker 1] (45:59 - 46:01)
Please stand closer to the microphone. I have to do this.

[Speaker 39] (46:01 - 47:57)
My name is Ana Leija, and I am a member of the Congregation of St. Adalbert Church and the Polish Latino Rosary Group of St. Adalbert. First, I would like to read a testimony given by Dr. Anita Blanchard Nesbitt, given to the Commission on Chicago Landmarks. I was, this is a quote, I was a member of the Landmarks Commission appointed by former Mayor Rahm Emanuel.

I worked with Ernest Wang and Reverend Toliver at the time. During my tenure, I led the program committee for commissions. I greatly enjoyed the meeting and appreciated the importance of commission to preserve architectural treasures.

The highlight of my work was discovering structures of unrecognized importance to landmarks of the city. Given my past experience with the commission, I am writing in support of the landmark designation for St. Adalbert Church in Pilsen. As you know, St. Adalbert Church was built in 1914 by Henry Schlagg. It was heralded as one of the finest religious architectural structures in Chicago. Schlagg was inspired by Roman churches and chose the altar marble for the church on one of his visits to Rome. St. Adalbert Church is a remarkable and beautiful structure and a true Chicago landmark. From a Catholic religious standpoint, St. Adalbert is a major patron saint of Poland. The church is a significant commemoration of his work and his significance of the Polish community. The stained glass windows of the church highlight his important mission.

It was a place of refuge for many immigrants arriving in Chicago and those who settled in Pilsen neighborhood. As the neighborhood has become more culturally diverse, the church continues to serve the Latino community as a place of worship and celebration of significant religious events. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (47:57 - 48:06)
Thank you. Thank you so much, Ms. Leha. Next, we have Michael Giordano, who will be followed by Adrian Chan.

[Speaker 12] (48:14 - 49:03)
Hi. Good morning. My name is Michael Giordano.

I'm the Executive Director of the Portage Park Chamber of Commerce. We are the sole service provider for SSA 28, Six Corners. I'm here today to voice the Chamber's support for GW Properties development at the former People's Gas site.

This retail and residential project is one of the final pieces to the revitalization of Six Corners. Our businesses need the 350-plus residential units. At its core, Six Corners has always been a vibrant shopping hub.

For years, it was known as the downtown of the northwest side. That is why this project has an exponentially and will have an exponentially positive impact on Six Corners and Portage Park. The Portage Park Chamber of Commerce has also provided a letter of support for this project to Mitch Goltz of GW Properties.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (49:04 - 49:10)
Thank you, Mr. Giordano. That letter is in your packet as well. Adrian Chan.

[Speaker 28] (49:11 - 50:06)
Good morning. My name is Adrian Chan. I'm on the Board of Directors of the Old Six Corners neighborhood.

Our neighborhood is located on the eastern boundary of the proposed development. We are here to speak in favor of the proposed development at 3955 North Milwaukee Avenue. We've worked for a number of years with the developer to come up with a plan that's acceptable to residents and the neighboring civic groups.

It's been a long process, and we're excited about the current plan that provides mixed-use residential as well as commercial properties. We think it's critical to both the development of the Six Corners Shopping District as well as the Irving Park Commercial District to the east that anchors our neighborhood. We hope that the Council will go ahead and move forward today with approving this project today so that it can finally get started and start benefiting our communities.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (50:06 - 50:14)
Thank you. That is on the agenda for votes today. Next, we'll have Julie Cook followed by Karen Schein.

[Speaker 32] (50:33 - 52:31)
Good morning. My name is Julie Cook. This is regarding application A-8899 to rezone the property at 4116 North Clark Street from an RS3 to a B3-1.

We live in a property directly adjacent to this building, and we are opposed to rezoning to B3-1, and we respectfully request that you change it to a B1-3. There is a proposal for a music school to move into this facility, which we are in favor of, and the B1 zoning should allow the music facility to operate as they are desiring, which includes classes, a small entertainment venue up to 149 people, as well as an incidental liquor license that allows them to serve alcohol during performances. We adamantly oppose B3 zoning for this property as it's too broad for the property and the location, which is embedded in a residential neighborhood.

Additionally, the property is within 4 feet of one of the bedrooms in my home. If the music school vacates, the B3 zoning would allow the property to be used for restaurants and taverns, including rooftop decks, in addition to many other uses. As I said, we're 4 feet away from this, and it would be very disruptive to our peaceful living.

We've been there since 2005, and we're very happy with the residential location. Other examples of businesses allowed under B3 include body art services, medium or large entertainment venues holding up to 1,000 people, banquet or meeting halls, hotels, motels, electronic data storage centers, and entertainment cabarets, all of which we do not want to live next door to. We've been given verbal assurances that the property will not be used for any of these uses, but we strongly feel that the purpose of zoning laws is to put this into coding and codify the zoning as opposed to giving verbal assurances.

We feel B13 would give them, the music school, the opportunity to operate as they function, and we would appreciate you approving that instead of B3. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (52:32 - 52:38)
Thank you, Ms. Cook. Next, we have Karen Schein, who is followed by Maria Hernandez.

[Speaker 32] (52:41 - 53:19)
Hi, my name is Karen Schein, and I live in the Washington Park Third Ward, and I am here to tell you about my support to the Sunshine Gospel Ministries Community Center that's coming to the 20th Ward. I support all viable businesses that come to the Washington Park Woodlawn area that bring resources to the community without taking resources out. The Sunshine Community Project offers diverse opportunities for the community, and I fully support their efforts as a member of, or as a resident of Washington Park.

[Speaker 15] (53:19 - 53:19)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (53:22 - 53:28)
Thank you very much, Ms. Schein. It's Maria Hernandez, followed by Jeremy Esparza.

[Speaker 35] (53:31 - 55:16)
I'm here to speak as part of Maria Hernandez. We are here for the landmarking of St. Adalbert's, and the entire campus, if it's landmarked, will be severely hindered to our parish's ability to find a buyer for the property. If we are unable to sell this property, our parish will continue to be burdened by all the costs of maintaining the site.

Our parish is considered, like St. Paul's, inherited the St. Adalbert's upwards to $1.5 million. The debt that we are now carrying, and are on our books, will continue to be carried for the years to come. In addition to our vandalism and our parishioners that we have to deal with protesters outside all of our masses, actually, for the last two years it's been a big issue.

Landmarking St. Adalbert's threatens our survival of St. Paul's Church. My family has gone through various different church closings. This would be the third one that we would have to go through.

Most vocal proponents of landmarking are people who no longer live in the 25th Ward and should have no say in who's in our future, this and our campus. They left us the residents of the former parishioners are crumbling property with no resources to maintain it. The location of St. Adalbert's campus makes it an ideal site for the redevelopment. As a residence, I ask you, and as families of Pilsen, why we cannot build this affordable housing for the number Sorry, sorry, sorry. Excuse me.

[Speaker 1] (55:16 - 55:21)
Excuse me. Please, if you're not, respect the speakers. Thank you.

[Speaker 35] (55:21 - 55:32)
As a resident, I ask you why we cannot cite this as a redevelopment for more green space for our children and families in Pilsen. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (55:33 - 55:39)
Thank you, Mr. Hernandez. We have Jeremy Esparza followed by Mary Gonzalez.

[Speaker 43] (55:41 - 57:37)
Good afternoon, everybody. My name is Jeremy Esparza. I'm a business agent with Labor's Local One and the chairman of the Cook County Building Trades Organizing Committee.

I represent over 1,600 laborers and over 80,000 construction craft workers throughout the nine county area, many of which work outside of the nine county area as well. Here today to thank Alderman Jim Gardner and Vice Chair Bennett Lawson for the courage today to stand up for those that have been voicing their concerns about the project at 3955 North Milwaukee. Specifically that the developer was not inclined to sign a project labor agreement which would include significant and robust protections for those working on the project and it would be beneficial for the community in terms of its timeline.

I'm here today to say that that project labor agreement has been signed by the developer which means that it would result in, again, a much better situation for those that are building the project. This $110 million project now has significant robust worker protections. The developer, excuse me, those that are building the project are going to get paid a living wage.

They will be trained in the work that they perform which will likely reduce injuries that could possibly occur in the workplace. Projects with a project labor agreement are more likely to finish on time, about 20% more on time compared to a project that doesn't have a project labor agreement. That's a win for the community because that means that significant timeline delays or congestion in the area will be heeded by this project labor agreement that's in place.

The Clarendale, which was built 200 feet away was constructed under a project labor agreement. Northwestern Medicine, about a mile east, was constructed under a project labor agreement. So this project is no different.

346 units would be great for the community but we want to make sure that those that are building it are respected as well. So, again, I want to thank Alderman Jim Gardner and Vice Chair Bennet Lawson for their support in standing up for what's right and standing up for the workers. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (57:38 - 57:42)
Thank you, Mr. Esparza. Our final speaker is Mary Gonzalez.

[Speaker 36] (57:43 - 57:50)
Thank you. My name is Mary Gonzalez. I moved into Pilsen to the 25th.

[Speaker 1] (57:53 - 58:17)
Please let Ms. Jackson leave the chamber. Let's clear the way. Thank you, everyone, for your patience.

Please continue. Sorry about that.

[Speaker 36] (58:17 - 1:00:21)
Thank you. My name is Mary Gonzalez. I moved into the 25th Ward.

In fact, it wasn't the 25th Ward at that time. But I moved into that neighborhood in 1958. I have not left that neighborhood.

I've stayed there all of those years. I'm part of St. Paul Catholic Church and I'm here to ask you to please do if you cannot give us additional time to work with the city on what we're going to do with St. Adelbert property, then please vote no. You know, several years ago, I worked with I'm going to ask again that everyone respect the speakers.

With many residents and homeowners as well as with the aldermen. And we went door to door and got certificates signed by homeowners saying, please do not make our community a historic landmark because it's going to be a phenomenal burden on our community. The city agreed with the support of our aldermen.

We are totally shocked that now our alderman thinks that we should be burdened with landmark status for just one congregation. I appreciate that people would like that facility to remain open. But St. Paul Catholic Church, not the Archdiocese, St. Paul Catholic Church is paying the bills. We are the ones securing the building. We are the ones called in the middle of the night. We are the ones that have to deal with picketers.

The very people who are here today picketing our 10 o'clock mass every single Sunday. So this is what we're having to endure. This lady yelling that who just left, we endure this every week.

Every single week for two years. And all we want is to take this burden off of ourselves. We'd like to sell the property.

We were working with the city to make this happen. And all of a sudden, on Thursday, we got word that the alderman was going to present it today. We know there's been a lot of lobbying.

I see him walking around talking to aldermen. And I just want to ask you to please defer it or vote no. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:00:22 - 1:01:43)
Thank you, Ms. Gonzalez. The chamber is going to remain. Folks, I'll ask the sergeant at arms, if you are not able to keep quiet, then you will be asked to leave or removed.

Please act like adults. Thank you. Onto the agenda.

First item up is document number 2024-001101. Introduced by Alders, Ramirez-Rosa, Rodriguez-Sanchez, Cardona, Fuentes, Siccio-Lopez, and Vespada. Regarding the amendment of the municipal code titles 5 and 17 by adding new chapter 5-11 entitled the tenant opportunity purchase block 606 district pilot program and by modifying section 17-7-0590 redefining the boundaries of the 606 district.

This item has a substitute ordinance and the committee members will find a copy with their informational packets. Alderman Vespada makes a motion to accept the substitute. All in favor, please say aye.

Any opposed, nay. The ayes have it and the substitute is before us. We have Charles Surridge, Policy Director of the Committee on Zoning Landmarks and Building Standards to present on this matter as well as Ray Phillips-Santos from the Law Department, Jung Yoo from the Mayor's Office and Edwin Ortiz-Reyes from the Department of Housing to answer any questions.

[Speaker 3] (1:01:45 - 1:10:30)
Can everyone hear me okay? Okay. Good morning committee members.

For the record, Charles Surridge, Director of Policy for the Committee on Zoning Landmarks and Building Standards. I am going to share some information with you now about the Northwest Side Housing Preservation Ordinance. I'm sorry, I'm having trouble with the slides.

Thank you. Nicole, if you wouldn't mind going to the next slide. Thank you.

So I want to start by providing some background information on the affordable housing stock in the Avondale, Hermosa, Humboldt Park, Logan Square, and Westtown neighborhoods which are covered by this ordinance and which informed the development of the ordinance. The majority of the affordable housing in the neighborhoods covered by this ordinance is what planners and policy makers call naturally occurring affordable housing. This term refers to housing that is affordable to low and moderate income residents without receiving any government subsidy and without any legal restriction on the rent that the owner can charge.

In the neighborhoods covered by this ordinance, the majority of the naturally occurring affordable housing stock is found in Legacy 2, 3, and 4 flats. This housing stock is particularly important in these neighborhoods as it is not only a source of affordable housing, but the primary source of affordable family sized housing as well. Alarmingly, one of the most significant housing trends in the city in recent years has been the loss of this 2 to 4 flat housing stock.

This trend and its implications for housing affordability in the city have been well documented and I want to highlight for everybody that your packet contains four recent research reports which speak to this issue and the information I'm sharing is built from those reports. The Northwest Side Housing Preservation Ordinance builds on the success of two companion ordinances passed in 2021. These ordinances establish minimum density standards and a pilot program which established a surcharge on demolition permits for residential buildings within designated boundaries around the 606 trail on the northwest side and in the Pilsen neighborhood on the lower west side.

This ordinance, the Northwest Side Housing Preservation Ordinance, builds upon these two ordinances in several ways. First, the ordinance expands the boundaries of the northwest pilot area and you can see a map of the proposed expansion on the slide and I just want to note here that all alders with portions of their wards represented in this pilot area are in support of the ordinance. The ordinance increases the surcharge on demolition permits from $5,000 per unit or $15,000 per building to $20,000 per unit or $60,000 per building.

Because the surcharge provision was piloted in both the northwest 606 area and the Pilsen area, the ordinance raises the surcharge amount in both the new expanded northwest boundaries and the existing Pilsen area. I want to note here that the Pilsen area is represented by Alderman Byron C. Joe Lopez who is in support of this increase.

Additionally, the ordinance expands the existing minimum density provisions within the northwest pilot area, disallowing the conversion of two flats, three flats, and four flats to luxury single family homes on blocks where the majority of the buildings are multi-family. Additionally, the ordinance legalizes the construction of new two flats by right on standard sized residential lots in areas currently zoned only for single family homes within the northwest area. It does so by reducing the minimum lot area per unit requirements in the RS3 district from 2,500 square feet per unit to 1,500 square feet.

And lastly, this ordinance establishes a tenant right of first refusal within the northwest area, giving tenants an opportunity to purchase their building when it goes on sale. Similar provisions have allowed tenants to buy their homes across the United States. So for this last right of first refusal provision in the ordinance, the ordinance divides rental properties into three tiers with a different timeline for each tier established in the ordinance.

The three tiers are one for buildings with one to two units, one for buildings with three to four units, and one for buildings with five or more units. So for buildings with one or two units, the owner for the ordinance would be required to give tenants 30 days notice of their intent to sell before listing the property for sale. Following this 30 day notice period, the owner must notify tenants of any third party offers they receive that they intend to accept.

Tenants then have 15 days from receiving this notice to exercise their right of first refusal by notifying the owner in writing of their intention to match the third party offer. For buildings in this tier with one to two units, an offer to purchase can be made by one tenant and the formation of a tenant association would not be necessary. Once a tenant submits an offer, they have 60 days to secure financing and complete the closing process.

For buildings in the next tier with three to four units, the owner similarly must give tenants 30 days notice of intent to sell. Following this notice period, again they must notify tenants of any third party offers they receive. Tenants then have 30 days from receiving this notice to exercise their right of first refusal.

In this case, an offer to purchase by tenants must be made collectively by more than 50% of the tenants in renter-occupied units. And if they make this offer, the tenants will have 60 days to secure financing and close. And then lastly, for buildings with five or more units, the owner must provide 60 days notice to tenants of intent to sell.

Again, after this period, any third party offers received, the owner would need to notify a tenant association if one exists or each tenant if no tenant association exists. Once the tenants or the tenant association receives notice, they have 90... I'm sorry.

Once the notice is given, if there is no tenant association, tenants would then have 90 days to form a tenant association and exercise their right of first refusal. In the case of five or more unit buildings, an offer to purchase must come from a tenant association, which must represent at least 75% of the renter-occupied units. And in this case, a tenant association would have 120 days to exercise their right of first refusal and then secure financing and close on the property.

And I just want to highlight here that this provision is revenue neutral and a couple things. One, it does not regulate the sales price of any property, so tenants who wish to exercise the right of first refusal would need to match a third-party market rate offer to exercise this right. The ordinance does not regulate the rent that an owner can charge.

And then I also just want to flag for everybody that there are quite a few exceptions in the ordinance and just a couple notable ones I want to highlight for everybody would be if the owner of a building wants to transfer ownership to a family member or if the property is involved in any type of court proceeding. And then I just want to end by sharing some data from the Department of Housing. They did an analysis of permit data from the period 2017 to 2023.

This analysis found that during this period, demolitions and deconversions were down significantly in both pilot areas where the surcharge was in effect. In the Northwest 606 area, demolitions were down 81% and deconversions down 72% over this period. In the Polson area, demolitions were down 66% and deconversions were down 65% during this period.

And you have additional data from the Department of Housing in a memo that should be in your packet. And then I also want to let everybody know in addition to lowering deconversions and demolitions, the demolition surcharges over this period generated $225,000 in revenue which was allocated to the Chicago Housing Trust. This revenue provided acquisition gap financing for two properties totaling eight units in the Here to Stay Community Land Trust portfolio in the Northwest area as well as funding the rehabilitation and repairs of two properties totaling 12 owner-occupied units in the Polson Housing Cooperative portfolio in Polson.

I will just end by noting that all older people, as I said earlier, whose wards are impacted by this ordinance are in support, that the ordinance's language was drafted and vetted by the Department of Housing, Department of Planning and Development, Department of Law, as well as the policy team in the Mayor's Office. And just note that representatives from all of those departments are here with me today to answer any questions. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:10:31 - 1:11:01)
Thank you, Mr. Sears. Just before we move on, I want to recognize Alderman Mosley for purposes of quorum and also Alderwoman Harris's request to attend the meeting by remote means under provisions of Rule 59. Alder Dowell makes a motion to approve Alderwoman Harris's request.

All in favor, say aye. Opposed, say nay. The ayes have it.

Welcome to you both. All right. Is anyone else presenting or are we onto questions?

Questions. Wonderful. Questions from committee members.

We'll start with Alderman Spada.

[Speaker 11] (1:11:04 - 1:14:03)
Thank you so much, Chair. More than questions, I'll just make comments because it's the work that I've been a part of going past. Even my time as Alderperson with a lot of our youth leaders in the Logan Square area who fought for this work.

The whole concept of this is driven by people's lived experiences in the Logan Square and Humboldt Park communities. And to have been a part of this work with Alderman Rosa, then Alderman Maldonado last term and to put forth an idea as a pilot and to see how broadly and successful it was in the purposes that it put itself to has been very encouraging. I will say three things and then I'll hand over the mic.

Number one, I know that there are questions out there about how does this impact development? Is this something that is anti-development or anti-growth? And I would say that it's been more about how we guide development in our communities.

I think the wonderful thing that we've seen about this in the first ward is it didn't result in a reduction in development or development proposals. It changed the character of the development proposals that we were seeing. We saw more people looking to add units, zoning cases to perhaps do a bump up or an additional floor rather than tear a property down.

Folks who are taking properties that probably six years ago would have been demolished and are doing 4 ADUs in the basement. This is what we want to see. It's been profoundly impactful.

I will also say to see an ordinance where those who support preservation and those who support growth and development are on the same side and supporting the same ordinance says that we have threaded a very difficult needle on this ordinance. That is very exciting to me as well. Finally, I'll say something that excites me in this is not only preserving what we have but starting to gain back what we've lost.

Being able to within the same envelope of any RS-3 zoned property to be able to do a two flat, the same development, the same building that I've lived in for a number of years and that my wife and I now own over at 2146 North Campbell, bringing back that two flat housing stock into our communities feels impactful in ways that we will only fully appreciate four or five years down the line. I'm so excited for this, for the collaboration of an incredible group of partners and collaborators and alders in this work. I'm very proud that we get to bring this before the committee today.

Thank you, Chair.

[Speaker 1] (1:14:04 - 1:14:06)
Thank you, Alderman LaSparta. Alderperson Fuentes?

[Speaker 11] (1:14:08 - 1:14:09)
Thank you, Chair.

[Speaker 26] (1:14:09 - 1:16:48)
Very similarly to my colleague, I want to provide comments. I have been doing housing work for over a decade in the 26th Ward and I've lived in the 26th Ward almost my entire life and I grew up in a three flat on Kedzie in between Beach and Hirsch. On that same block, we have had two to four flats deconverted into multi-million dollar single family homes.

The building that I grew up on is now for sale for $3 million. We just received a round of tax assessments in the West Chicago Township in which my residents have seen anywhere from 35 to 60 percent assessment increase. Our communities are under real threat of gentrification and displacement.

We have seen hundreds of families move out of our wards because they cannot afford to live there. The average rent in the 26th Ward for two bedrooms is about $25 to $2,800 a month. Our residents are house poor.

They are rent burdened. And many of our homeowners do not see a future in our communities because these new tax assessments have just told them they've been bought out. This is one tool in the toolbox for how we protect families.

We cannot allow two to four flats to continuously be deconverted and turned into multi-million dollar mansions, displacing families that have been in these communities for decades. It's extremely important to us. All the alders, by the way, that represent this particular ordinance and the geographical map that is outlined here support this ordinance.

They are sponsors of this ordinance because we are listening to our constituents. Our constituents elected us because they want to be able to continuously live and afford to live in their communities. This is just one tool.

One tool in a real big toolbox that we have to continue to leverage so that when we look up 10 years from now, 20 years from now, the families that are here today can still live in our communities. And so I ask our colleagues to support this ordinance. Our constituents have asked us to do this.

There are over 50 organizations that have been in our communities for decades supporting this ordinance. And we haven't had opposition. And I think that this is what can be a model for the rest of the city of Chicago when we think about preserving naturally occurring affordable housing and how you truly sustain and preserve communities across the city.

Thank you, Chair.

[Speaker 1] (1:16:48 - 1:16:51)
Thank you. I have Alderman Ramirez-Rosa followed by Alderman Cesar Lopez.

[Speaker 9] (1:16:53 - 1:21:06)
Thank you so much, Chairman Lawson. This ordinance has been many years in the making. It was our community in Logan Square that came together to advocate for the 606 Bloomingdale Trail.

And that's a wonderful community asset. It took vacant, unused infrastructure and it turned it into a wonderful path for running, for cycling, for people to gather and to enjoy the outdoors. But what we saw was once that amenity had been built in our community, the historic two, three, and four-flat apartment buildings and courtyard buildings along the 606 began to be deconverted.

And we lost that density that existed around the 606. And property taxes and housing costs began to skyrocket. And families that had lived there for generations were pushed out.

And so our community came together with policy analysts, our community came together and said, what can be done to address this displacement and what can be done to preserve this middle housing? In planning and zoning, we talk about middle housing. We have skyscrapers, we have single-family homes, but the vast majority of people live in that middle between those two extremes.

It's courtyard buildings, it's the 14 unit 1926 building that I live in, it's the two-flat that Alderman La Spada lives in. That's where most of our families find the affordability. That's where most of the working families in the city of Chicago are able to find an affordable place to call home.

And oftentimes these families come together and they purchase that building collectively. My parents bought their four-unit building in the 1970s and it was my tías and tíos, my aunts and uncles living in that building, my cousins living in that building that helped them cover the cost of that mortgage and helped them achieve the dream of owning their own home here in this country. And so we want to preserve that American dream.

We want to preserve that middle housing. In a lot of parts of the country, particularly on the West Coast, when so much of their housing development occurred in the post-World War II era, they talk about the missing middle. They have skyscrapers downtown and then they have a lot of single-family homes all around that.

But in Chicago, the middle is not missing. But if we don't take action to preserve this housing stock, it will be missing. And our schools will suffer from lower enrollment.

Our city small businesses will suffer from lacking the residents necessary to support their small businesses. And so I'm very proud of the coalition, the very broad coalition that came together to push this ordinance forward. And I really want to thank Jessica Vasquez and Charles Siridge.

I definitely want to thank Edgar at the Department of Housing, Jung in the Mayor's Office, and Ray Phillips-Santos. They worked many, many hours, did a lot of research, went through a lot of corrections and changes. And of course I want to thank Patrick Murphy as well, the Department of Planning and Development, for working with us on legalizing two flats by right in this ordinance.

I think this is a great way to promote that density and to promote that middle housing in our neighborhoods. So I would like to motion do pass once every colleague has had an opportunity to speak or have their questions answered on this question. But I do want to bring your attention to this packet.

Obviously there's a letter from Palenque Logan Square Neighborhood Association signed by dozens of organizations and local elected officials in the area covered. There's a letter from Urban Environmentalist that's been advocating for increased density and abundant housing in our neighborhoods. There's a letter from Bickerdock Redevelopment Corporation, North River Commission, Communities United, Hanna Center, the Puerto Rican Cultural Center.

So there's a lot of organizations who have signed on collectively in support of this, but there's also a lot of organizations that have issued their own individual letter because they see how our families live. We live in these two, three, and four flats. We want to preserve those two, three, and four flats.

And this is a really smart, comprehensive policy that's informed by data that will help protect the historic character and the diversity of our neighborhoods. Thank you. Thank you, Alderman.

Alderman Ciccio Lopez, followed by Alderman Vasquez.

[Speaker 2] (1:21:07 - 1:24:51)
Thank you, Chairman, and thank you to all my colleagues who have worked on this important piece of legislation. I would like to speak especially on the need in Pilsen. Just yesterday we heard a very contested hearing on finance.

Because of the distrust and the lack of protections that small homeowners often have, small businesses, communities, including churches. And I welcome and thank all the members of the St. Albert Church who are here. It is very important for our community to talk about the plans.

It was in 2019 that our community was suffering from tremendous amount of displacement. The number of teardowns and demolitions were very real. The solution that we had at the time in 2019 was actually to landmark 1,000 homes, 1,000 small homeowners that were already burdened by property taxes that could barely pay for the repairs.

And the proposal at the time was actually to make it even more expensive. I'm glad that we have taken always our time as a community. I want to thank all our community leaders, everybody who sits down, and especially our colleagues.

Because when we come together and truly listen to our communities, we develop important solutions that really protect the social fabric of our neighborhoods. In Pilsen, I said, these protections can help as you can see in the data. It stops developers from tearing down homes, converting to luxury units.

And now we have a very important plan not only to protect our community, but also to help those small homeowners who are in dire need to help to get repairs for legalizing basements, coach houses, attics. Just a few months ago, I had one of our community leaders who actually died in an attic because the attic did not have a fire detector. That is the reality that many of our communities live on.

And I'm very glad that our community came together to protect us from the big development that does not distinguish between any of our community members. What they always see is money. They do not see our communities as such.

So I'm grateful that the community came together, and with the support of the Department of Planning and Housing, there was an alternative development to have anti-deconversions and demolition fees that today are protecting our community. But we do need the support from the city. That's why I'm proud to have a comprehensive plan that we're going to take our time so that ADUs can receive support for those small homeowners who are in dire need.

And yes, I'm BB Public, and that's what I'm asking my colleagues to respect the will and the self-determination of our communities because part of this plan is actually to protect churches that in the past will also be converted in expensive condos instead of allowing us an opportunity to repurpose them for things that the community the community who elected me. Developers did not elect me. My community elected me to protect them from those unethical practices of the past when zoning decisions were exchanged by Biagra Peels.

Our community is no longer for sale. So with that I said that this is part of a comprehensive plan. As you see, all Peelson all our community is in this protection area.

We also want to bring resources money that should be used to protect and help expand ADUs so that we can help protect our community. Today we have not only closing churches, we also see the risk of closing schools, which is not something I'm going to sit and watch because our families do not have a place to live. Today I said respect not only our right to have these protections, but also help us in an important and urgent call to protect St. Albert as a landmark. It was democratically voted, it was done by the Landmark Commission and this is part of the same plan.

[Speaker 1] (1:24:51 - 1:24:54)
Thank you so much. Alderman Vasquez, please.

[Speaker 5] (1:24:59 - 1:25:45)
Thank you, Chairman. First, I want to thank our colleagues both present and former for really taking on this endeavor. There are a number of us whom we were running to get into these seats in 2019, really had affordable housing at the forefront, thinking about the different communities we represent, whether it's one that's currently experiencing gentrification or some that are post gentrification, seeing a different level of it scaled up as well.

So really, it is heartening when you see work like this being done and so I'm very appreciative of that. I do have questions, so I want to make sure I get to that. What data was used to determine the area as far as the pilot?

What were the determinants to figure out how you got to these wards, this area, that were going to be a part of the pilot?

[Speaker 3] (1:25:47 - 1:27:24)
Thank you for the question, Alderman. Happy to speak to it. This ordinance and the boundaries, it was all data-driven, right?

As I mentioned, there's four studies in your packet, which were the primary studies that we looked at in crafting these boundaries. There's three recent studies from the Institute for Housing Studies. Two of them pertain to the importance of the two- to four-flat housing stock in Chicago neighborhoods and the issues that are resulting from the loss of that housing stock, which they've documented.

There's another study from the Institute for Housing Studies at DePaul, the 2023 state of rental housing, which was one of the main studies in determining the boundaries. That study looked at US Census public use microdata areas, which are collections of usually three or four community areas. That study in particular found that the public use microdata area, which is made up by Logan Square, Avondale, and Hermosa, was the public use microdata in the city that saw the greatest decrease in the supply of rental housing that's affordable to lower-income renters, corresponding with the greatest decrease in lower-income renters.

Those were some of the main studies that helped us craft these boundaries. In addition to one other study in your packet, which is a study that was commissioned by the city, it's the 2019 affordable rental housing study, which looked at each community area and broke down the affordable housing stock by the naturally occurring affordable housing versus legally restricted. Those would be the studies.

[Speaker 5] (1:27:24 - 1:27:36)
When you're looking at that and you're trying to identify decrease, I'd imagine you're looking at points in time. You're looking at when it started to when you're at now to gaze the decrease. What were those two points in time?

[Speaker 3] (1:27:38 - 1:27:58)
I'd have to look back at the study. state of rental housing study, like I mentioned, it was 2023 state of rental housing. To be honest, I don't want to take a turn.

I don't quite remember the starting period, but the ending period was 2023. That's very recent data, really as recent as we can get.

[Speaker 5] (1:27:58 - 1:29:51)
The reason I ask that is let's say an area like 40th Ward, 47th Ward would have already gone through that decrease. If you go to 40th Ward, you're not finding the affordable housing because it ain't there anymore. If you're collecting data on decrease and it starts at a point past where you've already lost, then it couldn't compete as far as decrease because it's already gone.

I'm curious about that because one, I'd want to see a heat map of the whole city based on what the decrease looks like and also seeing it go back further because although I completely understand my colleagues in the moment that they're in those wards saying we have to make sure we're preserving this because they're watching it go, there are those of us who came into situations where it's already gone and are making sure that you don't lose even further and it wouldn't come up as steep a decrease because you don't have enough to begin with. That's something that I want to make sure is considered because again, there's a number of us who were this drafted in a different manner, would have been like just add us to the list.

I want to get that because something that's really cool about what they put here that I want to notate is not only the preservation but the fact that your single family only home zoning in effect doesn't exist in that area. There's been a number of us, myself included, that think we need to get to a city where you don't have it anywhere and that's not to say you can't build single family only but that you wouldn't be limited to only build that. If someone wants to do a two or four flat, they have all the ability to without having to go through a rigorous zoning process.

If a number of us wanted to then either expand the pilot first because Lord knows with ADU when you try to expand pilots here, people have different takes but if a number of us wanted to do something similar, copy, paste, introduce and pass, what's the possibility of doing so?

[Speaker 25] (1:29:56 - 1:30:36)
Can you hear me? Edwin Gutierrez, Senior Policy Analyst with the Department of Housing. Alderman, we'd be happy to sit down with you and talk about the current housing needs in your community, what the department can do to support you and what policies would be a good fit to address any affordability issues that you are struggling with.

If you would like to reach out to the department we would welcome those conversations and really we're looking at a number of policies across the city. We understand that not every policy is a good fit for every community in the city so we want to make sure that the solutions that we are putting forward are the correct fit for the needs of that particular area. Reach out to us, we would love to talk to you about this.

[Speaker 1] (1:30:37 - 1:30:56)
Actually, if I may on that, I would actually ask that the department do that citywide study and reach out to the alders instead because I think this has come up with a lot of our colleagues that there's opportunities across the city that we may be missing because we've just really looked at this area and so if that works with Albert Vasquez, I know Alderman Dahl wanted to add a point there too.

[Speaker 5] (1:30:56 - 1:30:57)
I'll wait for the point.

[Speaker 1] (1:30:58 - 1:30:58)
Sure.

[Speaker 34] (1:30:59 - 1:31:13)
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I was just going to ask the DOH representative if he could expound on some of the options they're looking at currently. Because that's not clear in what he did.

[Speaker 25] (1:31:14 - 1:32:16)
So we have a number of policies, a number of programs, that address different needs in different communities to give you just an example, we have this particular policy and this particular ordinance that we are supporting for this region, the northwest side. We also have programs like Rebuild and Rebuild 2.0 coming through our Bureau of Housing Preservation, which address preservation in communities that don't aren't experiencing the same steep increases in housing costs and the same rate of deconversions and demolitions, but that are losing housing stock for other reasons, such as buildings falling into disrepair, blight, and being demolished and turned into vacant land.

That's just a short list of things we're doing. We also have all of our development policies and programs, but there is a whole tool set of things that the department does to both promote development, preserve housing, preserve different housing stocks, and we would like to fit these solutions to the needs of that particular community.

[Speaker 34] (1:32:16 - 1:32:20)
Mr. Chairman, he said I could follow up on one last point of this.

[Speaker 25] (1:32:20 - 1:32:21)
As long as Andre says okay.

[Speaker 34] (1:32:22 - 1:32:33)
Andre said it was okay. Are you still looking at middle housing, the middle housing initiative?

[Speaker 25] (1:32:40 - 1:32:52)
I do not. I'm personally not connected to that initiative. I know that there is work coming out of the Mayor's office for the missing middle.

I can get you more information on that program through the chair once I follow up with them.

[Speaker 34] (1:32:52 - 1:32:53)
Thank you. I would like to get that.

[Speaker 5] (1:32:54 - 1:33:30)
Yeah, I was going to follow up on that. If you've got a comprehensive list of those programs, because I think a number of us have different tools that we want to use in our wards, don't potentially know where to start, and because of the nature of our jobs, we're busy taking care of potholes, tree trims, legislation, and not even talking to each other about things that we're doing. So being able to get that to us I think would be extremely helpful.

Yeah, citywide heat map would be great, and also we will absolutely be following up with you because we want to show up maybe in a couple months with an expansion of this. Thank you so much, and thank you, Chairman. I'm not in the committee, but I'm in support.

[Speaker 1] (1:33:30 - 1:34:07)
See you. Thank you. Were there any other committee members who had questions?

I know that I had some questions. I had asked for some data that was given out. I appreciate that, but like I said, I do think we need to look at options for this type of housing across the city.

I think there's also density issues in neighborhoods that have a lot of investments and that don't have much investment, and preserving and protecting that's important to keeping our city growing. So I look for follow-up on that through the committee on this and housing. Anything else?

I'm sorry.

[Speaker 20] (1:34:08 - 1:34:09)
How long was the pilot?

[Speaker 25] (1:34:09 - 1:34:26)
The question is, how long was the pilot? I know it was in a few stages. Can you explain that?

The ordinance passed in January of 2021, and we did our report for the data that you have in the memo in front of you up until December of last year. So 2021 through 2023, three years.

[Speaker 1] (1:34:26 - 1:34:29)
And the existing ordinance has or does not have a sunset?

[Speaker 25] (1:34:30 - 1:34:42)
The existing ordinance does have a sunset at the end of this year. That has been extended twice. It was sunset at the end of last year.

It was extended until April. And in March, I believe, or April this year, it was extended until the end of 2024. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:34:43 - 1:34:51)
So the ordinance in front of us extends it through 2028, right? Oh, the 2029, right? The substitute ordinance.

[Speaker 25] (1:34:51 - 1:34:58)
The sunset is when? Yes. The substitute ordinance extends it through 2029, the end of 2029.

Great. Thank you.

[Speaker 4] (1:34:59 - 1:36:48)
Alderman Reilly? Thank you, Chairman. I want to thank Alderperson Fuentes for coming and sitting with me and explaining this issue.

I don't have a whole lot of this type of housing stock in the ward I represent downtown. And I am sympathetic to the issues that gentrification are bringing to a lot of neighborhoods. I think there are components of the pilot that are, I think, very positive, especially giving residents the opportunity, through a right of first refusal, if you will, to purchase these buildings when they are put on the market.

I think that is a fair way to handle these types of things. What I'm trying to get my mind around, I know this is a pilot, and I don't want to extend this conversation too long, is why if all of the alders who represent this subject area agree that they don't want to see deconversion of multi-unit or the loss of additional rental housing stock to single family development, why they can't use their discretion and prerogative to limit that activity. My real basic issue here is how you're treating properties that are literally 100 feet away from each other across the street based on how the boundaries are set.

And again, this is a pilot and I'm certainly not going to encourage folks to vote against it. I'm just trying to understand that one piece, and I'm not sure which of the sponsors would like to handle that, but that might help inform my vote on this issue.

[Speaker 1] (1:36:49 - 1:36:52)
I think Alder Fuentes or La Spada would like to handle it.

[Speaker 26] (1:36:52 - 1:37:19)
I'll take it. Just simply, there are some matters in which prerogative cannot be levied. There are some zoning on properties that would allow the owner to sort of deconvert without a zoning change.

And demolition, also right now, as long as you sort of pay the fee, you can get it done. And so this is a way to sort of put some parameters around how much of that is controlled.

[Speaker 4] (1:37:20 - 1:37:58)
Okay, thank you for that. And then I guess I have a follow-up on that. It's kind of related to process because you mentioned demolitions, and that is something I'm super familiar with because we have a lot of landmark buildings downtown that are often at risk of being demolished.

We have a demolition delay for those. Does this pilot include anything like that for properties within the subject boundaries to require a pause of three or four months so the city can review that with local alder people and the community? Is that part of the...

[Speaker 1] (1:37:58 - 1:38:05)
I don't know if one of the sponsors or the department, what a demo permit is applied for, what's the process, basically, right?

[Speaker 4] (1:38:06 - 1:38:20)
No. Okay. The question is, under this pilot ordinance, are there special demolition delays built into it to protect these properties and trigger a community review?

I think we have an answer, but I think it's no.

[Speaker 3] (1:38:21 - 1:38:24)
I thought I saw Alderman LaSpada's hand, so Alderman, if you want to speak.

[Speaker 11] (1:38:26 - 1:38:28)
I'll take the rebound after you.

[Speaker 40] (1:38:28 - 1:38:30)
No, just somebody has to answer this question.

[Speaker 4] (1:38:30 - 1:38:32)
One person. Great.

[Speaker 40] (1:38:33 - 1:38:34)
The answer is no.

[Speaker 4] (1:38:34 - 1:39:38)
Okay. I'm not going to slow down the proceedings here, and I can follow up with the co-sponsors after the fact, but obviously, if you're looking to extend the pilot, that suggests to me that the longer-term goals for this area is to continue a policy like this, and I would just advocate that there be some consideration given to a demolition delay type of trigger, and again, the debate can continue over whether you should levy a per-unit deconversion fee or not, but at a base minimum, having that demolition delay in place of three or four months would empower, I think, the community, the local alder person, and the relevant city departments to really dive in headfirst, and we've seen that contribute to saving a lot of important landmark buildings across the city. That very same process that's worked so well for decades. Just some constructive input, and thanks for answering my questions.

[Speaker 1] (1:39:40 - 1:40:32)
Thank you, Alderman. Anyone else on this? Seeing none, Alderman Ramirez-Rosa makes a motion to pass.

All in favor, say aye. Any opposed, say nay. Seeing the Chair, the ayes have it.

The item is passed as substituted. We're going to move on. Thank you.

First up, we have document number O2024-0010378, the historical landmark designation for St. Adelbert's Parish Complex at 1622 through 1658 West 17th Street, and 1633 through 1659 West 16th Street. We have Daniel Clybur of the Historic Preservation Division of the Department of Planning and Development here to present the matter and answer any questions.

[Speaker 23] (1:40:44 - 1:40:44)
Mr. Clybur?

[Speaker 8] (1:40:45 - 1:48:08)
Good morning. Dan Clybur with the Department of Planning and Development. My coworkers, Deanna Cuvalo and Matt Crawford, are here with me as well.

The Commission on Chicago Landmarks is recommending to the City Council that the St. Adelbert Parish Complex located at 1622 through 58 West 17th Street and 1633 through 59 West 16th Street be designated as a Chicago landmark. The St. Adelbert Parish Complex is located in the Lower West Side Community Area, Pilsen Neighborhood and 25th Ward. For orientation, the St. Adelbert Parish Complex consists of four buildings on a campus bounded on a city block between Marshfield on the East, Palina on the West, 17th Street on the South and 16th Street on the North. Specifically, the proposed landmark designation includes the four primary buildings on the campus. The church is right in the middle at 1636 through 40 West 17th as represented by the red star. Just to the west of the church is the rectory at 1646 through 50 West 17th Street as represented by the blue star.

To the East is the convent at 1626 through 30 West 17th which is the yellow star. And then to the North, the school is at 1641 West 16th Street and represented by the green star. The Commission on Chicago Landmarks finds that the complex meets the necessary criteria for designation.

As you know, under the Chicago Landmarks Ordinance, a landmark designation must meet at least two criteria for designation plus the separate integrity criterion. So, building by building, the crown jewel of the complex is the church at the center of the cohesive campus. The Commission finds that the church building meets criteria for heritage, architecture, architect, and that the building is a unique visual feature in the city.

The complex exemplifies the history of Polish and Mexican immigration and the cultural heritage and influence of these communities in Chicago. It would be hard to overestimate the critical role that religious institutions played in the history and development of Chicago's neighborhoods. With its grand portico entryway, eight smooth columns with Corinthian capitals, granite, limestone, and terracotta details throughout, the Commission recommends that their church building is an excellent example of the Renaissance Revival style of architecture.

The church building was designed by Henry J. Schlachs, a prolific ecclesiastical architect in the city. He designed multiple other churches in the city, including St. Ignatius in Rogers Park, St. Iota, St. Mary of the Lake, St. Boniface, as well as St. Gelasius, a designated Chicago landmark. The City Council has previously found Schlachs to be a significant architect. In addition, the St. Edelberg complex encompasses half of a city block and includes a large-scale Renaissance Revival church with two 185-foot towers surrounded by low-scale residential and commercial buildings. It has been a prominent and familiar visual feature of the Pilsen neighborhood for over a century.

Next to the church to the west is the rectory building. The heritage criterion refers to the social and historic contributions that St. Edelberg's made to the city for over a century. The Commission recommends that this residence for the parish priests who led the congregation is important to the parish's heritage.

With respect to architecture, though not as grand as the church, it's a dignified Renaissance Revival design that complements the other parish buildings. It, too, was designed by Schlachs, as we discussed, as significant. And as part of the complex, it contributes as a unique visual feature within the neighborhood setting.

Next is the convent building immediately to the east of the church. The building housed the sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth who taught generations of children at the parish school. The social, cultural, and economic benefits that these religious women contributed to the parish and community should not be overlooked.

The Commission recognizes this and finds that the convent meets the heritage criterion. Architecturally, the building's symmetry, light color, and projecting cornice place it within the architectural quality of the entire complex such that the Commission recommends it meeting the architecture criterion. Just like the rectory, this convent is part of the distinct visual character of the whole complex which is outstanding in the context of Pilsen.

And finally, there is the former parish school building. Elementary schools were and are a critical part of Catholic parishes in Chicago neighborhoods educating generations of young people. Therefore, Commission recommends that the school building represents aspects of the city's culture and history.

The Commission also recommends that the building meets the architecture criterion as the ample windows for natural light and the carved limestone entrance portico point to the building's function and two colors of brick masonry add visual interest. As with the other three buildings in the complex, this building contributes to the whole as a significant visual feature. The Commission recommends that the St. Edelbert complex possesses sufficient integrity to convey its historic architectural and cultural significance. The existing buildings of the St. Edelbert complex remain in their original location. Its setting was and remains largely a late 19th century neighborhood. In 2014, the Archdiocese installed scaffolding at the church building and in 2019, the parish was closed and more recently the rectory and convent have been boarded up.

Clearly, there is deterioration of the church building that needs to be addressed. However, the Commission recommends that all four buildings have largely retained their original character-defining features, materials, and overall design and therefore sufficiently convey their historic significance. Again, the complex is located in the 25th Ward and Alderman Byron Seto Lopez supports the designation.

The Commission on Chicago Landmarks recommends that the significant historical and architectural features of the complex be identified as all exterior elevations including roof lines of the four buildings that make up the St. Edelbert complex, the church, rectory, convent, and school buildings. Building interiors are excluded from the significant features. In addition, the single-story accessory building located north of the rectory is also excluded from the significant features.

In addition, for the purposes of Section 2-120-740 of the Municipal Code governing the review of permit applications, the following additional guidelines shall also apply. The Commission's review of proposed work should ensure that the significant historic and architectural features of the exteriors and roof lines of the four buildings are preserved while allowing reasonable change and flexibility to meet new needs in accommodating future uses including potential new construction on undeveloped portions of the parcel. You have an ordinance to that effect and that concludes the presentation.

Thank you.

[Speaker 40] (1:48:09 - 1:48:10)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:48:14 - 1:48:16)
Thank you. Thank you enough.

[Speaker 2] (1:48:18 - 1:52:25)
Thank you, Chairman, and I want to thank the Commission on Landmark for making this possible. This has been 50 years in the making. I also pass along with my colleagues a timeline of how many efforts we made to make sure that we have a process that is done right, especially for the people of our community, parishioners and residents, Polish, Mexican, and many other immigrants who have contributed to our community, to these architectural gems that today we have, and the need to be repurposed always with the Committee and with our community at heart. I want to make sure that we do not fall for the misinformation. We are a community in peace.

Only a few months ago some parishioners were arrested because they were protesting and asking for this to take place. We have been working with the Commissioner of the Department of Planning. We've been working with the Landmark Commission.

We've been working with our community so that we have a repurpose that is fair, is transparent, and in line with the values and principles of our community that occur. Again, once again, respects our history, and we want to make sure that this Council also respects our right to self-determination. This was done, again, in conjunction with city departments, and again there are already some proposals at the table, but what we cannot continue to have is the unrest that is pitching parishioners against each other, people against each other, on something that should not be controversial.

This landmark meets the majority of the criteria to be landmark, and as we've done with the previous ordinance, we do have a plan, a preservation plan that puts people over profit. I want to make sure also that I'll be remiss to say, but we did get a letter from the Archdiocese of the City of Chicago in August, early August of this year, saying that they are going to collaborate with us in this process, rather than fighting as a pigeon against each other. I'll hold this document as proof that there must be closure on something that's created unrest and unnecessary controversy.

This landmark has been landmarking with every single provision and criteria, with the due process, and with the support of the majority of my community. I ask of the colleagues, I ask of my colleagues, just as I have always have always respect for each community, I am not co-alderman of any community, I am the representative of my community who has elected me to represent them, who has elected me to preserve our community and social fabric, and we do have a plan that includes everybody. Parishioners, residents, elected officials, departments, and we have proposals at the table.

I ask, and again, there have been controversies on this committee for items being hold and justified and other issues. I am asking my colleagues to respect the due process and put it in writing. We do have a plan to make this finally a reality after 50 years of contributions of Polish and Mexican communities that are coming together, to finally come to a plan that respects our social fabric and a right to self-determination, to have a place of worship, to have a place where we can come and join our history.

I am asking and urging, this has the support of preservationists, community groups, residents, all the community overwhelming, and I am committed again to work with St. Paul and any other parish to make sure that this process continues to be an inclusive, transparent, and respectful process. I am asking my colleagues to support this item that is in the 25th Ward, as we've done in other items, and respect our right to self-determination, our right to protect our history, our legacy, and our social fabric. Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (1:52:26 - 1:52:34)
Thank you, Alderman. Do I have other questions by committee members?

[Speaker 4] (1:52:36 - 1:54:50)
Alderman Reilly? Thank you, Chairman. We just, on the last item, talked about landmarks.

Certainly, I don't think anyone is going to dispute what a beautiful building and what an important part of history it served in the community. My inclination is always to support the local aldermen of record. We've been elected to do this job and sort through community process, and I've always respected that boundary.

That hasn't always been the case in this committee. I certainly experienced that in Grant Park, fighting to keep that free and clear of new buildings and development when I was a freshman alderman here. One thing I wanted to ask, given the fact that the Archdiocese is objecting to the landmark status, and it's not surprising when a landowner does.

Because, I understand, we only get one bite at this apple landmarking. If this committee rejects this, that's it. You don't get to try again.

This is a pretty important proceeding for this property and for the community. Perhaps the department could handle this question. I know Cindy Rubick is here.

She's an expert. When is the deadline for this committee to take up this matter? Perhaps there might be some further dialogue about this project.

Let me finish. The reason I ask is that I know that the alderman has been working very hard and he's documented his efforts to try and find a way to repurpose this property in such a way that it serves the community. It seems that based on proceedings yesterday, the future of the Pilsen TIF is now in question.

Is there more time left on the clock here before we have to act on this in a definitive and final manner? Sure. We have both Deanna Cavallo and Cindy Rubick-Chan.

[Speaker 1] (1:54:50 - 1:54:51)
Deanna, do you want to take that?

[Speaker 16] (1:54:53 - 1:55:17)
Yes. Thank you, alderman, for the question. There is a section of the municipal code that deals with the timeline, section 2-120-705.

It does mention that the city council needs to take action within 365 days. If no action is taken in that time, the designation would pass.

[Speaker 4] (1:55:18 - 1:55:30)
Based on that, what is the current time frame? When must we act to avoid this automatically occurring?

[Speaker 16] (1:55:32 - 1:55:38)
The recommendation from the commission was transmitted to city council on June 24th of this year.

[Speaker 4] (1:55:40 - 1:56:49)
Okay. There is a bit more time on the clock, it seems. Again, my preference would be to try and find a way to work with the Archdiocese to make this a more cooperative effort.

For Alderman Sig Cho Lopez, the solace comes with the fact that you can always come and call this up on the agenda if you're not satisfied with how those negotiations go. I'm sure you're frustrated and probably exhausted by this particular project, and I know it's been controversial for you, but my approach with landowners during a landmarking process has always been to try and afford every opportunity to reach a compromise that best serves both parties. There have been instances in my own ward where that hasn't occurred, despite my best efforts, and we went ahead and landmarked the property against their consent for the greater good of the community.

I just wanted to make sure we've exhausted every option here before this committee has to make such an impactful decision today. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:56:51 - 1:56:51)
Briefly.

[Speaker 2] (1:56:53 - 1:57:36)
We, again, had meetings with the Archdiocese and, again, I put it in writing. This is August 5th, 2024. I met with Commissioner Boatwright, members of the Department of Planning, as of last week, making sure that we provide plenty of opportunity and options.

I think, as you heard from public comment, even for people who want more time, the protests every weekend between parishioners, the unrest between our community on something that should not be controversial. Again, we are committed, and the Department of Planning is committed to exhaust all options. The Archdiocese with a letter themselves, and I'm happy to read the letter.

[Speaker 1] (1:57:37 - 1:57:39)
I'm actually going to ask them to address it as well.

[Speaker 2] (1:57:40 - 1:58:48)
Now, what I'm saying, again, once again, is that the community has the right, the community has the right to self-determination after, as the aldermen have said, exhausting all options. I do not want more of our communities. This could be voted in July.

I took another extra month. We have August, and I met with them just as last week. The Archdiocese can come with their attorneys, and they can continue, as they've done with the landmark process, to delay and create more unrest.

I am here, on behalf of our community, overwhelmingly asking our council members. This is something that the department, my office, and our community leaders, community residents have worked for months, for years, I would say. I'm going to ask that we take a determination today.

I'm committed, again, with a letter in writing to continue to work with the Archdiocese, but we are not going to impose bias on our community for profit that I'm not going to do.

[Speaker 1] (1:58:48 - 1:59:46)
Thank you, aldermen. Thank you. That's enough.

I just want to point out a clarification as well. The timeframe starts on June 24th. The first meeting would not have given us notice in July for this meeting.

This is the first meeting that it could be heard in the Zoning Committee, because we did not meet in August. Also, I just want for clarification to note that the designation status that's pending protects the buildings as is currently. They would not be allowed to obtain a demo permit or enter into a building department without full review by Landmarks, as if it is a landmark currently.

We both have both the timeframe that we understand and the current protections and what would go forward. I have a couple speakers. I did ask representatives from the Archdiocese to come up as the property owner.

They did not speak earlier. I thought that was appropriate. If there is a short statement you guys want to make and then take some questions, we have some from other committee members as well.

Please identify yourself for the record.

[Speaker 18] (1:59:47 - 2:01:37)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My name is James Gioli. I'm the General Counsel of the Archdiocese of Chicago.

We've brought with us Bishop Lombardo, who is the Episcopal Vicar for the part of the Archdiocese that includes Pilsen, includes St. Paul Parish and the former St. Adelbert Parish. He's got a brief statement to make. I just want to clarify one thing, because we talk about the owner and I don't want there to be any confusion.

Let me be the lawyer for one second. That is to say that the property that is at issue today is held in trust by a corporation. The beneficial owner of the St. Adelbert property is actually St. Paul's Parish, not the Archdiocese of Chicago. The Archdiocese, which has a corporation, is the trustee. The benefit of any development of this property, the assets, go to St. Paul's Parish. As you'll hear, it's rather critical to the future ministry of St. Paul's that that occur. The last thing I'm going to say is that I just want to confirm that in the packets of the committee is a scatter gram map, so at least when we're talking about the community, we can see on that scatter gram what the community actually wants. Those who participated in all the proceedings of all the landmark commission, filed petitions, submitted letters, spoke, are recorded here, and you can see that overwhelmingly in Pilsen, the position is to oppose landmark status. Last word is, our request to you is to endorse Alderman Riley's request, which is we are trying very hard to work both with the aldermen and with the city to work out something that would be beneficial to everyone, including St. Paul's Parish, of course. So, our request is that the vote today be simply to defer the matter so that work can happen. Now let me introduce Bishop Robert Lombardo. Thank you.

Briefly, quickly. Great.

[Speaker 29] (2:01:37 - 2:03:33)
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I'm very grateful for this opportunity to speak to you and the members of the council. Just to be clear, when St. Adelbert's closed, the parishioners and the property of St. Adelbert's became part of St. Paul's Parish. So they bear the burden of the renovations and the upkeep of that property, which has deteriorated over the years. I could assure you that we want to make sure that all of the stakeholders, the city, the neighbors, as well as St. Paul's, are taken into consideration. We did have an offer for the property which would have provided 40% affordable housing.

We are concerned about affordable housing in that area. That was blocked. And so, let me just say this.

We have another example of a very good project that was done. Cabrini Hospital was no longer functioning as a hospital. The chapel has been preserved, and development was done around it.

I don't see why we can't take some time and have cooler heads prevail. And let's see how we can all come together and let's work together to find a solution. I think there's so much division right now in our world, in our country, and in our city.

Please, let's take some time and work together. The first time I met with the aldermen, we had a very pleasant, a very nice meeting, and I assured you that we want to work together to find a solution that would be in the best interest of all parties. I would just simply ask, let's do that.

And if I could say one other thing. Look up at the picture up there. The school has no artistic value.

Let's be real here. The church does.

[Speaker 1] (2:03:34 - 2:03:50)
So by landmarking the whole thing, and... Folks, if you cannot behave, all right, Sergeant at Arms, I want you in this middle section back here. The next person who shouts out will be asked to leave.

Behave like adults, please. Thank you.

[Speaker 29] (2:03:53 - 2:04:44)
So again, just to conclude, just to conclude, we do want to make sure that everybody's interests are taken care of. We can no longer sustain a parish in that neighborhood. So we have to figure out how best to use those resources for the good of the mission of the church, as well as assisting the neighborhood.

That's part of the mission of the church, to assist our people. So I just want to make that assurance to you and to the committee, and I think we need more time. And I would also say to those who are disrespectful, you don't help the cause when we're trying to set up a peaceful, respectful manner of negotiating a settlement.

So if you think that you're accomplishing your goal...

[Speaker 1] (2:04:44 - 2:05:03)
I would ask you to address your comments to the chair. I appreciate the sentiment, though. Thank you.

Thank you. Thank you. We do have a couple other hands.

You can go ahead and have that person make her way out. Alderman Espada, followed by Alderman Vail.

[Speaker 11] (2:05:05 - 2:06:13)
Thank you so much. There we go. Thank you so much, Chair.

I appreciate the dialogue. I am really proud to represent some incredible landmark districts in the First Ward, and some incredible properties that are both have city landmark status and also have national landmark status. In the midst of that, though, and I will say, like, in the First Ward, we have had moments where I would say there are religious orders and institutions that sometimes run counter to social teaching and economic justice.

So I can see both sides on this. What I have noticed and observed consistently is that landmark status and even having something close to landmark status adds time and cost to the redevelopment, particularly where public subsidy is concerned. And I'm wondering, like, anyone can answer on this as a part of it, but how that has been considered as part of the conversation around landmark status.

[Speaker 1] (2:06:15 - 2:06:19)
So, again, your question is the future plan, the future use of the property.

[Speaker 11] (2:06:19 - 2:06:51)
For example, if you wanted to convert a church to market rate development, sadly, there's very little oversight on that. If you want to do what I'm hearing the community would want to do, which is something that involves public benefit and public subsidy, the involvement, for example, of the State Historic Preservation Ordinance adds significant time and cost and effort into that. And I'm wondering how that consideration has been a part of the conversations around landmark status.

[Speaker 1] (2:06:52 - 2:06:53)
I'll let you both take it.

[Speaker 2] (2:06:53 - 2:08:35)
I can respond. And certainly I think that's what we hear, you know, so cool heads can prevail. This is not a new issue.

Again, we've been trying to have these conversations and that's what I mentioned, the timeline. And as you mentioned, time is of the essence. These things take time.

And I think one of the things that we cannot do is coming back to redo the whole process again. That's what we're asking here. So what I'm asking of my colleagues is that this is a well thought out process.

The Zoning Committee actually voted in 2020 and 2022 actually on a proposal to give us a voice by down zoning the property. There was no agreement and the Archdiocese wanted more time. We considered more time, we allowed more time and we work on the landmarking so that we can get to this point.

Now and I would say I agree with exactly what they're saying. In fact, the letter, that's what it's important that says, actually the letter actually that we received from the Archdiocese it says that it's on behalf of St. Paul. Now, what we cannot continue to do is to continue to delay the process as you can hear from our parishioners and residents that are at each other's throats.

That is not conducive for a process that already has a framework. There's two proposals. One of them fell through not because we blocked it.

We couldn't block anything. It has to be open in the public. And when we start asking questions, what actually we found out is that one of the signatures of our representative of the Archdiocese couldn't even be verified.

[Speaker 1] (2:08:36 - 2:08:38)
So again, please I hate to interrupt you.

[Speaker 2] (2:08:38 - 2:09:37)
His question was about I'm providing documentation on the timeline. So what I'm saying here is that there is a landmarking process that again as per the Commissioner of Planning is not stopping any proposal for coming in. I'll again and I know that we're hearing it directly you're hearing publicly from me.

We don't block any proposals. All proposals are always in the open. There's already a few proposals you heard here even.

Proposals at the table that could very that are very feasible. I think the attempt here of modifying and restart the process again will benefit a specific developers with a specific purposes. And I'm not going to tailor any process to particular people.

This framing is for every developer who has coming forward, including our parishioners, so that we can achieve a goal. You've done it in our ward. I think I'm very qualified at any other Alderman here to do the same.

[Speaker 11] (2:09:37 - 2:09:39)
Thank you Alderman. Point of information.

[Speaker 1] (2:09:39 - 2:09:42)
I'd like the Archdiocese to respond to that and actually answer that question.

[Speaker 49] (2:09:42 - 2:09:45)
Point of information. Point of information, Alderman David Moore.

[Speaker 1] (2:09:45 - 2:09:46)
Yes, Alderman Moore.

[Speaker 49] (2:09:47 - 2:10:22)
Thank you so much. In regards to, so I can understand and if Alderman LaSpada would correct me. I think what he's asking, which would make sense if I'm asking the right question.

I just want to understand that by landmarking and we want to support Byron Central Landfunds, but the question becomes by landmarking, I think this is what I'm hearing, is there an incremental cost to that development if we landmark, and if there is an incremental cost, is that incremental cost to that new development going to fall on the taxpayers?

[Speaker 1] (2:10:23 - 2:10:28)
So that would be another part of that question from Alderman LaSpada. Yes, you guys want to respond?

[Speaker 18] (2:10:28 - 2:11:24)
We'll take a shot, and then if Bishop Lombardo has I think what we're trying to say is that the opportunity to put together the sort of development that would benefit the community in the way Alderman Silchez-Lopez has said could be much more difficult to even start if you landmark in advance. If we can work on the kind of proposals the Alderman is talking about, which we are absolutely open to considering fully, with no special favor to any special developer by any means, then the landmark piece of it, the preservation piece of it, can simply be part of the planning. If you just landmark the whole site right now and make it a landmark so that anyone you're trying to attract has to deal with those extra costs and burdens and also barriers to what might be done, even attracting that partner becomes much, much more difficult.

So the request is for time, not for you to say no.

[Speaker 1] (2:11:25 - 2:11:46)
I understand that. I think the other piece of Alderman Moore's question was about city funding, and I don't believe there's any city funding committed to this project. One second.

I'm sorry? Alderman Dahl? Okay.

Exactly. To her point.

[Speaker 18] (2:11:47 - 2:12:06)
But we would imagine there would be city money in here based on the that was signed, that was backed out of, had no public funding in it. It was a private offer for 40% affordable housing and preserved the church building. All right.

You know what? We're going to... Alderman Spaulding, does that answer your question?

[Speaker 11] (2:12:06 - 2:12:07)
May I ask a second?

[Speaker 1] (2:12:09 - 2:12:10)
You do have the floor, yes.

[Speaker 11] (2:12:11 - 2:12:46)
It's a second and final question. I understand sometimes there are aspects of our community that rise to such cultural significance that we do act above and beyond what may be the interest of the specific institution. That said, it's a two-part question.

Chair, I would ask items that proceed after this. 10-5-5-9-1, 10-9-0-4. I assume that these are landmark status designations with the consent of the property owners?

[Speaker 1] (2:12:48 - 2:12:52)
We're deferring the first one. But Revolva Theater does have property owner consent.

[Speaker 11] (2:12:53 - 2:13:23)
So from that perspective, and I have the letter, I appreciate you handing out the letter, but it appears to convey support for the TIF process and not for the landmark designation. I'm only asking, is it accurate to say that both the parish and the archdiocese currently object to the landmark status? Can you share with us why you believe that they currently object?

[Speaker 1] (2:13:26 - 2:13:37)
We're going to have order here. They can speak to their objection if you want to add anything. I would like someone from your team, whoever you choose.

Alderman?

[Speaker 29] (2:13:38 - 2:13:47)
First off, the church was deconsecrated. That's a church issue, not a civic issue. So it was deconsecrated for a reason.

[Speaker 1] (2:13:48 - 2:13:50)
The question was about the opposition to landmarking.

[Speaker 29] (2:13:50 - 2:13:50)
Right.

[Speaker 21] (2:13:53 - 2:15:58)
For the record, Better Price, and I'm counsel to St. Paul Parish as well as the archdiocese on this matter. First, to answer Alderman LaSpada's question, economic hardship is not a legitimate consideration at the landmark commission stage, nor was it considered. However, now, the zoning committee and the city council as a whole can take a holistic perspective, just as they did in very recent memory when they decided not to landmark the Pilsen neighborhood as a whole.

So economic hardship, which is going to fall on St. Paul, is a very legitimate consideration that hasn't been taken into account yet and is not reflected in the materials that the landmark commission forwarded. The archdiocese's position was that after the June 6th hearing, at which the alderman retracted some of his May public hearing attacks and said he wanted to work with us, we said, yes, we will work with you as well. What would you like our assistance with?

He said the Pilsen TIF expansion. We are agnostic, literally, despite being a religious organization. Agnostic on how this property is ultimately financed, except we know that it will require and this is for Chairman Dowell's point as well, it will require a third party who has yet to be identified, who is going to be able to have lenders, equity investors and bring a lot of money and energy and faith into restoring the church building, which is our goal as well.

We would like to see this property revitalized and we'd like to see it revitalized with the church. That's going to take private money, it's going to take public money, it's going to take zoning, it's going to take the cooperation of the city, and it should be done comprehensively with the landmarking. We are not saying don't landmark, we are saying, please do it carefully, do it in conjunction with something which actually results in third party investment in the restoration of the property for reuse.

[Speaker 1] (2:15:58 - 2:16:04)
Thank you, Ms. Castle. Alderman LaSpada, does that go further? Do you want to briefly, Alderman, and then we're going to Alderman Beall.

[Speaker 2] (2:16:05 - 2:16:47)
I think that we got to have the same courtesy to respond in adequate time. We got to be fair. I think that one of the things that I would like to say, I didn't retract anything.

What I said is that the city is in partnership to find solutions because this is an important part of our community. I did not retract anything. The other thing I want to say, and I want to make sure that the commission, and Diana maybe can talk about economic hardship as well as, you know, the consent, I think that we discussed also at length in the landmarking commission that was voted unanimously.

So, Diana, if you want to maybe add to it.

[Speaker 16] (2:16:48 - 2:18:46)
Thank you, Alderman. So, regarding the timing that this took through the commission, the preliminary recommendation was taken on August 7 of last year. And as you all may know, there is a very detailed process and a timeline that the commission does seriously take and do all of their due process to make sure that everyone has an opportunity to comment and they have a full record before they take a final vote.

That said, there were suggestions for landmark designation for this property to the program committee of the landmarks commission starting in 2016. There were actually four different times that that was suggested to the commission. So, it has been something on the commission's, I guess, workload for a number of years.

Regarding the economic hardship, there is a procedure in the code that deals specifically with economic hardship and it does set out parameters by how the commission would evaluate any applications for economic hardship. During the designation process, the commission is bound to consider only whether the property meets landmark criteria. And those are the criteria that are what they need to make their final vote and recommendations to city council.

Economic hardship comes into play when there is an actual project. If there was a denial of a permit and the applicant has an opportunity and hearings and process that is available to actually demonstrate economic hardship and a decision by the commission which also would be then forwarded to city council for review. So, I just wanted to clarify that part.

[Speaker 20] (2:18:46 - 2:21:28)
Great. Thank you. Alderman Beale.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I've used to be chairman of Landmarks years ago and I've been down this road a few times and I do believe that it's probably in the best interest of everyone to take a step back, regroup, come together, and come up with a consensus on this particular project. And it may take another party to come in to kind of be a mediator on moving forward with this project.

Anytime you have contentious sides for or against, it's just in the best interest to just pause. When I was chairman, I did that numerous times and intervened on behalf of both parties and came up with a consensus that everybody could live with where nobody's totally happy, but everybody could live with. And based on what I'm hearing from both sides on this particular issue, I can sense there's some common ground that we could reach.

But I think we just need to take a step back and regroup. I don't think we're in a hurry to piss people off, and I think that's what we're doing right now. We're in a hurry to piss people off instead of backing up and coming together to where everybody can again, have cool heads and kind of just move forward on common ground.

And if that were to happen, we still have time. It sounds like we have until June of next year before this thing actually rolls into effect without city council approval. So we're not in a hurry.

And so let's take a pause and bring people together, man, because I guarantee you when you put people in a room to work an issue like this out, there's more in common than it is than we have apart. So that would be my recommendation and I would hate to landmark anything and I've never done that when I was chairman. I've never landmarked a piece of property that the owner was not in favor of.

That's an injustice to people who own a piece of property, okay? And so that's my recommendation. You can do what you want, but that's my recommendation to kind of have cool heads prevail.

[Speaker 1] (2:21:29 - 2:21:42)
Is that a motion to defer? Mayor Alderman Beall? Alderman Beall makes a motion to defer.

We can absolutely we can speak on the motion to defer, which is in order. Alderman Ramirez-Rosado you're next.

[Speaker 9] (2:21:42 - 2:21:57)
Thank you so much. So my question to the archdiocese is you've mentioned on a number of occasions a proposal to build housing there. Would that did that proposal result in the demolition of any of these buildings that would be landmarked today?

OK.

[Speaker 18] (2:21:59 - 2:22:07)
Well, nothing, the church building was to be preserved. We do have our, yeah.

[Speaker 21] (2:22:08 - 2:22:54)
Burr, and this is, sure, and this is a full five years ago. 2019, that's how long we've been trying to sell this property. It preserved every building on the site.

The school remained the school. And there was new construction only in the, about basically the westerly portion that's the parking lot. And I believe there was a little bit of an addition on the easterly side, but it was able to preserve all buildings.

We never got to the stage where we could see if it was fully financeable or that it would be supported by zoning, planning, community stakeholders. But at least on paper, as it was drafted to go to PD intake, it saved all the buildings and built new affordable housing.

[Speaker 9] (2:22:54 - 2:23:03)
So why is that proposal then incompatible with landmarking? If you're saying that that proposal would not have demolished any of these buildings.

[Speaker 21] (2:23:03 - 2:23:38)
As I said, it wasn't fully vetted, and it wasn't the spreadsheets, the numbers, as our DPD commissioner said. The numbers got a pencil, or it ain't real, right? And so we're trying to create the flexibility with the city in collaboration so we can right size the landmarking.

We also don't want to forego the potential financing mechanisms that would only be available if there was partial landmarking. And again, nobody wants to tear down the church building if we don't have to.

[Speaker 18] (2:23:38 - 2:24:45)
But there was a later, that's true. And then there was a second deal that was signed up that would have preserved the church, but would not have preserved all the other buildings. And that was the deal that included 40% affordable housing that we were unable to move forward on because of resistance.

I'm not going to blame anybody. I'm just going to say that proposal is the one that was pulled back when the landmark process began. So it was a proposal to preserve the church building, but not the other buildings.

And then the developer withdrew because of this particular landmark process. All we're actually saying is at the end of the day, no one is saying it's impossible to preserve some part, or even maybe all, of the property. But it's much better to do that as part of the collaborative process that others have spoken of because at least then the landmark process itself is not a barrier to at least having the kinds of discussions you need.

So I don't mean to oversimplify it, but really we're not saying no. We're saying let's work on it. But it's hard to work on it if you jump first and then go try to find your partner.

Thank you.

[Speaker 9] (2:24:45 - 2:24:57)
I have a question for the Landmarks Division. So if this item were to be held, what I'm hearing is that if the council did not act within a year, the landmark designation would automatically go into effect?

[Speaker 16] (2:25:00 - 2:25:03)
Yes, that is what the municipal code states.

[Speaker 9] (2:25:03 - 2:25:09)
And during that time, would these properties be protected from demolition?

[Speaker 16] (2:25:10 - 2:25:17)
All permit applications would have to be reviewed by the Commission on Chicago Landmarks. And that started last August.

[Speaker 9] (2:25:19 - 2:26:54)
I'm very concerned that these properties would be demolished. It was people, parishioners, many of them the poorest of the poor, who came together long before I was born, long before anyone here was born, and put their dollars together, their coins together, to build this sacred space. And so for me, I think the question before this body is, are these buildings worthy of landmarking status?

And the Commission on Landmarks has done their work. And I'll say this, the Landmark Division of DPD and the Landmark Commission, they're very conservative. I have a very robust preservationist community in Logan Square.

And we'd love to landmark a lot more things. But the Landmarks Division has a standard that they need to meet. The Landmarks Commission is very judicious in reviewing what should be landmarked or not.

And I think that they've done that work here. And so for me, the only question before this body is, should this be landmarked? Yes or no.

And I think the Landmark Division and the Landmark Commission has done its work. And the question then is, why wouldn't we? And I think that the only answer that we can give here is that because we would be OK with demolishing any one of these buildings.

And I think that the community has said that they would not be OK with that outcome. And I think about the parishioners who years ago put their dollars together to build these beautiful sacred spaces. And so I'm for landmarking.

And I hope that that's what happens sooner rather than later.

[Speaker 1] (2:26:54 - 2:27:08)
Thank you. Thank you, Alderman Rosa. I just want to clarify something.

They cannot demolish any building here without permission from the Landmark Commission, just like as if it was a final landmark. So just for clarity on that. Alderman Dowell, did you have anything else you wanted to add?

[Speaker 34] (2:27:09 - 2:28:21)
I was going to say what you said. I wanted the Landmarks Division to say that this is an orange-rated building, right? So it's like Corpus Christi, which is in my ward, which is an orange-rated building, not easily torn down.

The community doesn't want it torn down. And we're currently working with a developer to figure out how to right-size that building, use the convent, use the school, enhance the courtyard so that we can have affordable housing there. Perhaps the city would participate in that process.

And I would agree with the former chairman of the Landmark Committee, Bill, that it's probably in the best interest of everybody to sit down and try to work it out. This is a beautiful building. Corpus Christi is a beautiful building.

And we should figure out a way to preserve it. And if people have the right goal in mind, it can be done. But we have to sit down and talk about it.

[Speaker 1] (2:28:23 - 2:28:25)
Thank you, Alderman. Alderman Reilly, anything else?

[Speaker 4] (2:28:26 - 2:30:45)
Yes, just a couple of final comments. And I appreciate all of Alderman Dowell's remarks just now. You know, if we had a looming deadline of a month or two and the gun were truly to our heads here today, my inclination would likely be to vote to landmark these buildings.

But we do have more time here. And as was noted by the current property owners, when you negotiate a deal like this, to go and basically put the cart before the horse by landmarking these properties, it does limit the scope of those negotiations. There are, as the Landmarks Division would be happy to confirm, a number of financial tools and instruments that can be applied for to help support these properties, substantial financial incentives.

Typically, you negotiate those things across the table with the would-be future developer. And like many of my colleagues who have church properties, whether they're the archdiocese or other denominations, we've gone through that careful process. And I think we've seen a lot of these projects end up being successful.

Sometimes they take longer than we'd like. And that is kind of the nature of negotiating over landmark properties. But in a lot of cases, putting in that extra time can lead to a really positive result.

And so again, at the end of the day, if the local alderman were to exhaust that process and they aren't able to reach a final agreement, one of two things happens. Either he ushers this landmark designation through this committee and we approve it, or no action's taken and these properties are landmarked in a year. And so I do think the deck is stacked heavily in the favor of the local alderman and the community throughout the remainder of what's left of the negotiating time period.

So I would also, you know, renew a call for us to take a bit more time and hold this while the parties try and work out a compromise. Thank you, Chairman. Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 43] (2:30:46 - 2:30:46)
Point of information.

[Speaker 4] (2:30:47 - 2:30:49)
I see Alderman Moore, you have your hand up, yes.

[Speaker 49] (2:30:49 - 2:31:24)
Yeah, just a point of information on both what Alderman Dow and what Alderman Rowley just stated. He pointed out two things that could happen. And based on Alderman Carlos Ramirez Rosa, is the third thing that whoever owns the property, whether it's Archdiocese or the church, I heard somebody else, some other entity, whoever owns it, could they demolish?

And if so, can something be put in place, a letter, if it's binding, that no demolition can take place without the Alderman's consent?

[Speaker 1] (2:31:24 - 2:31:31)
All right, I'm gonna ask Deanna Cavallo from Preservation Division to answer that on demo.

[Speaker 16] (2:31:31 - 2:33:20)
Yes, so the application to demolish would require review by the Landmarks Commission. And again, the municipal code does have a process for that that does involve multiple steps potentially, depending on, you know, the preliminary decision of the Landmarks Commission. So namely, if there's a preliminary denial of a demo application, there are steps in the process to discuss with the property owner.

There is an opportunity to have one-on-one kind of conversations to reach a compromise solution. There is a public hearing that would be scheduled if there's no decision on a compromise, and then a final decision by the Landmarks Commission. What I also wanted to note is that the Landmarks Commission decision on a demolition would be based on whether the property is contributing or not.

At that point, they are not looking at financial implications or any other considerations other than if the property is contributing. And based on this recommendation, application for demolition of any of these four would logically be that these are contributing buildings, that is what the Commission has already recommended. The only consideration, the only opportunity that there is for demolition that the Commission would not have any say in the matter is if there is a finding by Department of Buildings, Department of Fire, that a property or a specific building is imminently dangerous and hazardous to public health and safety.

That kicks everything out of the Commission purview.

[Speaker 49] (2:33:20 - 2:33:42)
Let me just add as well. And I'm very much aware of everything that she said. I only asked a question and I don't know if it's upholding.

While if there was the vote on to wait, can something be put in writing that nothing could be demolished without the ultimate consent? That's a yes or no answer.

[Speaker 1] (2:33:43 - 2:33:58)
Let me get back on that. So right now the buildings would have to get approval of the Landmarks Commission, their recommendation for demolition. The next step is then it comes to this committee, yes?

Don't we approve demo permits for landmark buildings?

[Speaker 16] (2:33:59 - 2:34:09)
You would receive a recommendation if the Commission was recommending to demolish. But if the Commission is denying a demolition, their action is the final action.

[Speaker 1] (2:34:09 - 2:34:19)
And I think I've seen two maybe in the six years I've vice chaired or as chief of staff for the committee. Is there maybe one a year, if that?

[Speaker 16] (2:34:20 - 2:34:28)
Very limited, but that again is typically when you are dealing with a landmark district where you might have non-contributing buildings within the area.

[Speaker 1] (2:34:29 - 2:34:52)
And even then it's done, that recommendation is done by ordinance. So it would come before the committee. So we would weigh in on that all the more.

So it already is in writing, I think to satisfy what your concern is, yes? One second, one second. Yes, thank you all the more.

No other hands, if you want a quick point of clarification then we're gonna move to a vote.

[Speaker 2] (2:34:53 - 2:36:55)
Yes, so again, our office always works in earnest, even if some people may not disagree. Some people may disagree with the consent, but we have had these conversations. The Archdiocese is very much aware of that.

We continue to welcome those conversations. But again, and I think maybe this is what needs to be done in writing. We do not want developers to blindside us.

We do not want this to be teared down for development that does not have the consent of the community as you asking for consent to use of a very sacred space in the community. We also asking reciprocity. I see that some of the colleagues want more time for us to come back.

And I think when we can come back to this is gonna come back to the same thing. We're not going to allow the demolition of the parishes on the orange rated and landmark recommendations. That is not going to change.

I think that what we can expect changing is a real open process that does not blind our community and puts the buyer in front of the interests of the parishioners and the community. And I do think that that needs to be done publicly because again, just some of the remarks that were done today, we continue to be here in earnest. It will be the desire of our community.

We would like to take the vote today. I see some of our colleagues that are asking otherwise but it will be my hope and my wish for the sake of a community who continues to protest each other that we take a determination today because you already have the commitment. The same commitment that you asking, you already have that today, including finding solutions and financing to make it happen because that much how we care.

It will be the wish of the local aldermen to take a determination today. And that's what I wanna make sure is in record. And you always have an open hand to make sure that we do right by both St. Paul and St. Albert as well as the Pilsen community that has been displaced and step on for way too long. Pilsen is not for sale. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:36:56 - 2:40:03)
Thank you, Alderman. All right, there's motion on the floor is to defer this item. I will take a roll call vote.

Those of you on the remotely, please unmute. Alderman LaSpada, the motion is to defer. A yes vote defers the item to a future date in this committee.

We have Eilish Tully of the Historic Preservation Division of the Department of Planning and Development to present and answer any questions. Again, if I could have it a little quieter in the gallery, please.

Please, thank you. Eilish.

[Speaker 33] (2:40:04 - 2:40:13)
Thank you, Chairman. Good morning for the record. Eilish Tuffy, coordinating planner for Historic Preservation with the Department of Planning and Development.

[Speaker 1] (2:40:13 - 2:40:27)
Hold on, I'm sorry, Eilish. Folks, be quiet or leave the room. I know the item is over and you're on your way out, but we have a lot of meeting left to go.

Please, if I could have it quiet in the gallery, Eilish.

[Speaker 33] (2:40:32 - 2:40:32)
Thank you, Chair.

[Speaker 40] (2:40:35 - 2:40:35)
Yeah.

[Speaker 33] (2:40:36 - 2:43:05)
Eilish Tuffy, staff to the Commission on Chicago Landmarks. That body has recommended to council that the Romova Theater be designated as a Chicago landmark. The building is located in the 11th Ward and Alderwoman Lee is aware of the proposed designation.

Designed by architect Myer Nathan, the Romova was built specifically as a movie theater. The commission found the building meets two criteria for landmark designation. Under the heritage criterion, the theater was commissioned by Jacob Maskelyunas, a businessman from the Lithuanian community living in Bridgeport in the early 1900s.

At that time, numerous immigrant populations were employed by the Chicago Stockyards. The main character of Upton Sinclair's well-known novel, The Jungle, was a stockyard worker named Jurgis Rudkus, who happened to be a Lithuanian immigrant. Next slide.

Architecturally, the theater is a fine example of the Spanish Baroque style that was popular during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The commission recommends that all exterior elevations and roof lines be included as protected elements, as well as the restored vertical blade sign and 1944 marquee. Next slide.

To the north of the elaborate theater facade is the attached commercial shops building, which was a common addition to smaller neighborhood theater buildings. This type of arrangement is known as a theater block. Another comparable building type, similar to this one, is the Music Box Theater, which opened four days after the Remova, both screening films starting in August of 1929.

Next slide. The movie theater closed in 1985, and after nearly 40 years of vacancy, the current owners, R Revival LLC, purchased the property from the city of Chicago for $1 in 2022. The recent year-long rehabilitation was part of a larger TIF redevelopment agreement with the Department of Planning and Development that required owner consent to landmark designation.

The ownership entity has provided the required consent, and we are now carrying out the landmark designation through the proposed ordinance. This concludes my presentation.

[Speaker 1] (2:43:06 - 2:46:12)
Thank you, Ms. Tuffy, or Tolley. Next slide. Any questions by committee members?

All in favor of Apprentice, moves do pass. I have the companion Music Box Theater in my ward, and they have just gone through a renovation of their own, so happy to see it. I know I've also spoken to a woman, Lee, who's very excited about what's happening at the Remova.

All in favor, please say, aye. Any opposed, say, nay. Finish your, the ayes have it, and the item is passed.

Thank you, ladies. Next up, we have three historic landmark fee waivers. We will hear them all together.

I'll read the ward, followed by the address, and take a motion at the end. In the 34th ward, located at 25 East Washington. In the fourth ward, located at 3402 South Giles Avenue.

Lastly, in the third ward, located at 2401 South Wabash. There's no further questions by committee member Alderbeal. Makes the motion to pass on the orders.

All in favor, say, aye. Opposed, nay. Finish your, the ayes have it, and the orders are passed.

Next up are large signs over 100 square feet in area, 24 feet above grade. We'll hear them all together. I'll read the ward, followed by the address, and take a motion at the end.

Three signs in the 47th ward, at 3940 North Ravenswood. And lastly, one sign in the 48th ward, located at 5937 North Broadway. There are no further questions by committee members, although the spotter moves do pass.

All in favor, say aye. Opposed, say nay. Thinking of the chair, the ayes have it.

Now, we will move on to map amendments. An effort to ensure the committee meeting runs as smoothly as possible, to group together according to witness, and will be heard in that order, rather than word order. We've got witness seats right up here.

First up, is that okay if we take one quick one before yours? All right, all right. I'm actually gonna go to the bottom of page four, and then we'll come back to this item.

Document number A, 8901 in the ninth ward, ordinance referred 71724. Common address is 34 through 40, West 95th Street. Change request, the B3-1 Community Shopping District to RS-1 Residential Single Unit Detest House District.

Alderman Beall.

[Speaker 20] (2:46:13 - 2:46:18)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is basically a simple future land plan usage zoning change.

[Speaker 1] (2:46:19 - 2:47:03)
Great, any questions by committee members? Seeing none, Alderperson Fuentes moves do pass. All in favor, say aye.

Opposed, say nay. And thinking of the chair, the ayes have it. The item is passed.

We have Daniel Kreider from the Department of Planning and Development, Catherine here as well.

[Speaker 10] (2:47:03 - 2:47:05)

As I've said, we have Danielle Kreider from the Department of Planning and Development to present.

[Speaker 10] (2:48:41 - 2:55:05)
That was impressive, Chair Lawson. Thank you. Yeah, so this is basically the zoning implementation of the Western Avenue Corridor Plan across three different wards, 40th, 47th, and 49th Ward.

This community-led process began in 2020. The Western Avenue Corridor Plan was adopted by the Chicago Plan Commission in 2022. And so we've been working with these communities and these alders for a long time to create a new vision for Western Avenue, which has been a little neglected.

We would like new vibrancy to be brought to the area. We'd like for it to be more walkable. We'd like new development there, new density.

And so this rezoning is an implementation step of that greater visioning. And so here you can see the map. The study ran from Addison to Howard Street.

Next slide, please. And it covered more than land use, but we're gonna focus on land use today. It also included public realm, transit and mobility, infrastructure improvements, et cetera.

Next slide, please. There was robust community engagement back 2020 through 2022 with steering committees, focus groups, virtual events, mailings, other pop-up events. So a lot of work went into this with the community.

Next slide, please. And ultimately what we wanna see, like I was saying earlier, was more vibrancy. We want more mixed use activity, but focused understanding that that can't be distributed evenly throughout the whole five mile corridor.

We want it to have more of a sense of identity. We wanna be able to support the current and future businesses. And we wanna see new housing investment and development to support affordability concerns in the area available to a range of families and individuals.

Next slide, please. So we identified five neighborhood centers. Next slide, please.

That are distributed along Western Avenue. Those are our centers of commercial activity and where we would wanna see the most density. Next slide, please.

And you can see this map here. And our land use framework consisted of three different categories. We have the neighborhood center, which is that stronger ground floor commercial environment with the highest density.

We have housing infill where commercial isn't bad, but we understand that it might not be consistent. And we have the commercial transition areas. We recognize that this would be a big departure from the existing character of much of this corridor as it exists currently.

And so if some of these more auto oriented uses that don't create as walkable of an environment remain, they should be concentrated in the pink areas. Next slide, please. I should also note that Western is a high quality bus corridor and it does have a ground line station.

And so these are the density recommendations and zoning recommendations from the plan. But because these land use categories are pretty conceptual, there are multiple zoning categories that could serve these purposes. And it was really initially designed for discretionary project approvals like plan developments and rezonings.

And so it has this flexibility, but it didn't necessarily articulate exactly what new by right districts should be. Next slide, please. And so the discussion of rezoning was really around by right projects and streamlining the approval of new development on Western Avenue.

And so when we talked through it after the adoption of the plan, we saw these as being the biggest benefits of the rezoning. We saw it as streamlining the development that we really wanted to see, especially on those smaller parcels where we could see by right development. We saw it as establishing more consistent development expectations so that if you had a parcel, just like your neighbor's parcel, you had the same rules.

It applied the ARO requirement, which is 20% in this area to by right projects, which is a huge deal. It limits new auto-oriented uses that are incompatible with the vision, primarily by eliminating C1 and C2 zoning districts. It encourages, can you go back please?

Thanks, sorry. It encourages the denser mixed use and multifamily development that we talked about by significantly increasing in some situations the allowed density. And it demonstrates a commitment to seeing new development in this area to fulfill this vision.

Next slide please. And so the rezoning that was just read off would include about 600 parcels going to B33 or B23. We do tend to have more B33 than you would expect based off of that map you saw earlier showing the housing infill and the neighborhood transition areas.

Just because we were trying to combat commercial vacancy and B3 allows a little more flexibility for those existing ground floor commercial spaces. It just seemed like a better fit for a lot of the corridor. We didn't touch the plan developments.

There were some properties that were already properly zoned, which were not affected. And then we also did a lot of analysis to understand any new nonconformities and special use conditions that would come about as a result of the rezoning. And a big part of our outreach was around understanding this.

Next slide please. So, we talked about the Western Avenue Corridor Plan and all the outreach that went into that. And so we understood that there was consensus already around a vision for this corridor, but we continued to use the list serve and the webpage that we already had to do outreach for this effort.

We had two open houses that were really focused on talking to the immediate adjacent property owners, the actual property owners, helping them understand the technicalities of what this rezoning would mean for them and understanding kind of this conceptual future development idea. We don't talk about a ton in community outreach. And then we did, or are, depending on the area, sending out the legal notice for 250 feet.

All property owners within that radius will receive a notice about the rezoning. So that's all I have. I'm here if you have any questions.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:55:07 - 2:55:10)
Thank you, Ms. Kreider. Any questions by committee members?

[Speaker 5] (2:55:11 - 2:59:29)
Alderman Vasquez, if you wanna. Yes. Thank you, Chairman.

Thank you so much, Danielle and the team. I wanna thank really the Department of Planning and Development for the amazing work they've done, as well as our colleagues in city council that are a part of this. So Alderman Matt Martin, Alderman Maria Hadden, myself, Alderman Silverstein, who kind of began this whole conversation about looking at Western and really re-imagining it.

Because I think anywhere you go in the city of Chicago, if you're on Western, you're seeing auto shops, you're seeing driveways, you're seeing things that serve a purpose, but sometimes feel like relics. And so trying to identify a way to re-imagine those areas, to create livable spaces, to create the kind of retail businesses that can be supported by more density. Western was pretty ideal.

That being said, it was a process. It took a number of years to have these conversations, to have meetings with the different stakeholders, the block clubs, all to get that buy-in, to hear their take, to make sure that what was being presented is something that addressed concerns that they had and spoke to some of their vision. So I'm extremely excited.

I think in a ward like the 40th, where we try to create more affordability, having something where you're in effect upzoning the area, but also making sure the ARO is still a part of it is crucial, that you're not losing that affordability. I appreciate the mayor's push for cutting the tape. We're cutting a whole lot of tape by upzoning this area.

So whether you're a developer or you're the lawyers looking at this, it's one less zoning meeting you have to go to because we're saying Western is open for development, for business, for density, for housing in ways that I believe it should be. So the colleagues that I mentioned, this is gonna be the first time the city of Chicago does something like this to an area. We know that with the history of Chicago, more often than not, large areas get downzoned because alders of yesteryear wanna control every single thing that occurs in every single square foot of their ward.

We're not planners. We're city council members. We want people that know this stuff to do this stuff.

We wanna facilitate the kind of growth that leads to growing a tax base because we are gonna need it to be able to pay for all these investments, all these services that people wanna see every day. And so I not only invite, I urge our colleagues that share Western, the same ones where we've had conversations about bus rapid transit and looking at how we urban plan all of it to similarly go through the same process. We actually have advocates who've been doing this work.

We've had people at the departments. We've had colleagues where we're reaching out to other alders that share Western to say this is a way to approach it that allows you to really plan ahead and be proactive with what can happen in a way that I think moves our city forward. So I wanna thank Danielle Crider, Tom Bolino, both city planners and really wanna thank Catherine Hurd, the supervising planner who, I just don't know how someone dedicates that much time to really create all this.

If you would have been a part of watching the process, putting together all the slides, putting together guidebooks to design it, talking to all the different stakeholders which have at times different opposing viewpoints, bringing us all together, talking in development to get something that isn't just a concept and isn't just a thought and actually something that we can actuate on is something that I can't thank her enough. And I think the city will be in debt for the work that she's done here. You know, I hear a lot from urban planners with ideas.

We get nervous as heck being city council members who have to then face the neighbors when we have to make those kinds of changes. So to be able to be that thoughtful is something I wanna make sure that she's commended for as well as the rest of the team. So I highly urge this committee to support and anybody at all that shares Western or any other neighborhood and is thinking about something like this, hit me up.

We're happy to help and walk you through what it was like for us. I see all benefit to it. So thank you very much, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:59:29 - 2:59:43)
Thank you, Aldervazquez. I think I pointed out before this team serves the whole North side. So they're done on Western, right?

We've got other things for them to do. Exactly. I also, I do have Lucy Nye from the 47th Ward to add.

[Speaker 35] (2:59:49 - 3:00:21)
Hello, thank you, Chair. I'm Lucy Nye from staff to Alderman Martin here to speak on the upzoning to Western Avenue. Alderman Martin is pleased to support the rezoning of Western to allow for increased density compared to today's low density car centric zoning.

These proactive changes will support the community's priorities for land use and development as identified in the Western Avenue Corridor study. Alderman Martin is excited to join his colleagues, Alders Haddon and Vazquez, and very thankful to the Department of Planning and Development for spearheading this initiative. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:00:22 - 3:01:18)
Thank you very much. Any other questions by committee members? Seeing none, Alderman Spada moves to pass.

All in favor, say aye. Any opposed, say nay. Seeing the Chair, the ayes have it.

And the item is, items, actually, I'm sorry. I have to read them out. Alderman Spada makes a motion to pass on ordinances A-8894, A-8893, and A-8890.

All in favor, say aye. All opposed, say nay. Seeing the Chair, the ayes have it, and an item will be reported out.

Thank you. Do I have a representative from the 46th or 33rd wards here? 33 is here, great.

Change requests, B-3, I'm sorry, B-2-3 Neighborhood Mixed Use District to M-1-1 Limited Manufacturing District.

[Speaker 4] (3:01:19 - 3:01:40)
Patrick Murphy, we'll start with you. Sure, Chairman Patrick Murphy with the Department of Planning. This is simply a sunsetting of a former Type 1 that has a two-year expiration date.

No permits were pulled. So there is a passage in the municipal code that allows for the sunsetting of any Type 1 that falls under this expiration.

[Speaker 1] (3:01:41 - 3:01:44)
Sounds good. We have Becky Rios from the 33rd ward. Anything to add?

[Speaker 48] (3:01:45 - 3:02:04)
Yeah, so I just wanna also, same. We do have a community-driven zoning process, so we are open to, and we are in communication with the current property owner, and we are open to reviewing any new proposals to rezone the property. So we just, yeah.

[Speaker 1] (3:02:05 - 3:02:44)
All right, any questions by committee members? Seeing none, Alderman Ramirez moves to pass. All in favor, say aye.

Any opposed, say nay. Seeing the Chair, the ayes have it, the item is passed. We are gonna come back to the 46th ward item when we have the Alderman or a rep here to discuss it.

Top of page five. Document number 22509-T1 in the 49th ward. Ordinance referred 7-17-24.

Common address is 6411 North Newgard Avenue. Change request is an RS3, residential single-unit detached house district to B23, neighborhood mixed-use district. Attorney is Dan Lauer.

[Speaker 41] (3:02:45 - 3:03:29)
Afternoon, Mr. Chairman. This is 6411 North Newgard, 22509-T1. I represent Dermot Logan.

He's a contract purchaser. The proposal, RS3 to B23, he's gonna construct four dwelling units, three garage spaces. It's just under 1,800 feet from the Loyola Red Line, so there's an administrative adjustment to allow for the parking.

The four units are duplex down front and rear, simplex simplex. We're super grateful to Alderman, Alderwoman Maria Haddon for her support, and she actually went above and beyond clearly because there was a zoning lot issue, potential zoning lot issue with this property, this parcel. We have a letter of support from the Alderwoman.

[Speaker 1] (3:03:32 - 3:03:42)
Great, we do have the letter on file. I will say my first non-dorm apartment was at 6608 North Newgard, so I know exactly where this is. The building, is it right next to the commercial use or the alley as well?

[Speaker 41] (3:03:42 - 3:03:46)
Yes, just to the south, yeah.

[Speaker 1] (3:03:46 - 3:03:56)
Got it, got it. Any questions by committee members? Seeing none, all the Knutson moves do pass.

All in favor, say aye. Any opposed, say nay. Pity Chair, the ayes have it, the item is passed.

Thank you.

[Speaker 23] (3:03:56 - 3:03:56)
Thanks, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (3:03:57 - 3:04:18)
Next is item number 22511-T1 in the 49th Ward, ordinance referred 71724. Common address is 70157015 North Sheridan Road. Change request is an RT4, residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to V23, neighborhood mixed use district.

We have attorney, Tyler Manick.

[Speaker 24] (3:04:19 - 3:05:54)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Tyler Manick. I'm an attorney with Shane Banks Kenyon Schwartz and the attorney for Adrian and Amy Marcus who own the property at 715 North Sheridan through their LLC.

Adrian and Amy would like to construct a five-story residential building consisting of 20 dwelling units. The property is currently zoned RT4. To effectuate this project, the owner requires a zoning map amendment from RT4 to a B23.

As a transit serve location, 10 indoor parking spaces will be provided. All ARO unit, all four ARO units will be on site plus another unit will be Adrian and Amy's resident. As part of this application, the applicant includes variation requests to reduce the rear setback to zero, to reduce the loading space requirement from one to zero and to reduce the north side setback to zero.

The project falls within the Lakefront Protection Ordinance. So after the city council process goes through, we have to present the plan commission. However, this project as part of that process has been reviewed and improved by DPD, MLPD, CDOT, CFD and Stormwater.

The applicant has worked closely with Alderwoman Haddon and engaged in a public community meeting organized by the Alderwoman. Through the owner's close work with the Alderwoman and her staff, the Alderwoman has given her full support to this project. I respectfully request this committee's favorable recommendation to rezone 7015 North Sheridan to a B2-3 zoning district.

And I'd be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (3:05:55 - 3:06:28)
Thank you. We do have a letter of support from Alderwoman Haddon on file. Any questions by committee members?

Seeing none, Alder, LaSpada moves do pass. All in favor say aye. Opposed say nay.

Seeing that the ayes have it, the item is passed. Bottom of page five is document number 22519-T1 of the 25th board. Ordinance referred 7-17-24.

Common address is 2219 South Oakley Avenue. Change request, RS3, residential single unit detached house district to RM5, residential multi-unit district. Tyler Manick.

[Speaker 24] (3:06:29 - 3:08:01)
Thank you again, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. Tyler Manick again on behalf of the owner and applicant, Pilsen Rentals LLC for 2219 South Oakley. 2219 South Oakley is improved with eight dwelling units.

When the applicant applied for building permits to perform long overdue deferred property maintenance after purchasing this building, it was determined that two of the units at this building were non-conforming and the owner needed a zoning map amendment to obtain the building permit and have a conforming minimum lot area per unit. As a result, the applicant worked closely with Alderman Cisco Lopez, his staff and his zoning advisory board to rezone this parcel to a conforming zoning district of RM5 and the alderman has issued a letter of no objection accordingly. The zoning map amendment application includes the following variation relief to reduce the MLA per unit from 400 to 390, to increase the floor area ratio from 2.0 to 2.01, to reduce the parking requirement from four to three, to reduce the front setback to 9.73 and to reduce both side setbacks to zero. All of this relief allows the applicant to preserve the building as it sits today and protect its housing options. In conclusion, I respectfully request this committee's recommendation to rezone 2219 South Oakley from RS3 to RM5 zoning district and I'd be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (3:08:01 - 3:08:37)
Thank you, we do have a letter of support from Alderman Cisco Lopez. Any questions by committee members? Seeing none, Alderman McDowell moves do pass.

All in favor, say aye. Opposed, say nay. Finisher, the ayes have it and the item is passed.

Thank you, Mr. Manek. Up next, document number 22501 in the 30th ward. Ordinance referred 71724.

Common address is 5555 West Irving Park Road. Change request, B11 neighborhood shopping district to C21 motor vehicle related district. We have Mr. Pekarsky.

[Speaker 30] (3:08:38 - 3:09:30)
Good afternoon. I am Tom Pekarsky of the law from Gordon and Pekarsky representing the applicant on this matter. But before you seeking an amendment of the city of Chicago zoning map from the current B11 to that of a B, excuse me, C21 for the property commonly known as 5555 West Irving Park Road.

The subject is currently unimproved and used for the storage of auto vehicles. The applicant seeks to improve the site with a new car wash. We have reviewed our plans with Alderman Cruz.

We have also had multiple community meetings where we presented our proposal to the Portage Park Chamber of Commerce. The project has received both the support of Alderman Cruz and the community. Therefore, we asked the committee to vote the recommendation of passage of the application to the full city council.

[Speaker 1] (3:09:32 - 3:10:06)
Thank you. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Cruz. Any questions by committee members?

Seeing none, Alderperson Fuentes moves do pass. All in favor, say aye. Opposed say nay.

Finish with ayes have it. Item will be reported out. Next up is document number 22500 in the 19th ward.

Ordinance referred. 7, 17, 24. Common address is 102, 100, Southwestern.

102, 100, Southwestern. It's on the north side, I'm sorry, guys. Change request, B11, neighborhood traffic district to C21 motor vehicle related district.

Tom Pekarsky.

[Speaker 30] (3:10:07 - 3:11:12)
Again, thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. I am Tom Pekarsky of the law firm of Gordon and Pekarsky representing the applicant. But before you seeking an amendment to the city of Chicago zoning map from the current B11 to that of a C21 for the property commonly known as 10200 Southwestern Avenue.

The site has traditionally been used as a motor vehicle repair shop. In the past, the site had been down zoned and the use became legally nonconforming. A previous owner discontinued his business license which resulted in the loss of the legally nonconforming status.

The applicant seeks to reestablish this historical use and therefore needs the zoning amendment. We reviewed our plans with Alderman O'Shea and presented the proposal during his community review process. The project has received both the support of Alderman O'Shea and the community which has been indicated by a letter previously forward to the chairman.

Therefore, we ask the committee to vote its recommendation of passage of the application to the full city council.

[Speaker 1] (3:11:14 - 3:11:49)
Thank you, Mr. Pekarsky. We do have a letter of support from Alderman O'Shea. Any questions by committee members?

Seeing none. Alderman Fuentes moves to pass. All in favor, say aye.

Aye. Any opposed, say nay. The ayes have it.

Item is passed. Bottom page six is document number 22498 in the 11th ward. Ordinance referred 71724.

Common address is 3428 South Lituanica Avenue. Change request, RS3, residential single unit detached house district to RT4, residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district. We have again, Tom Pekarsky.

[Speaker 30] (3:11:49 - 3:12:49)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. One last time, I am Tom Pekarsky of the law firm of Gordon and Pekarsky representing the applicants on this matter. Before you seeking an amendment to the city of Chicago zoning map from the current RS3 to that of an RT4 for the property commonly known as 3428 South Lituanica Avenue.

The site is improved with a two and one story three unit residential building. The applicants use the rear unit as their residence, which is the one story portion of the building. The applicants would like to construct a second floor addition to make the rear equal to the front dimensions of the building.

The building will remain three units. The request is to permit the increased floor area. We have reviewed our plans with Alderman Lee and presented the proposal to the community.

The project has received the support of both Alderman Lee and the community as evidenced by a letter previously forward to the chairman. Therefore, we ask the committee to vote its recommendation of passage of the application to the full city council.

[Speaker 1] (3:12:50 - 3:13:21)
Thank you. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Lee. Any questions by committee members?

Alderman McDowell moves to pass. All in favor say aye. Any opposed say nay.

Let me show the ayes have it, the item is passed. Thank you. Mr. Piekarski, top of page seven, document number 22504 in the 48th ward, ordinance referred 71724. Common address is 6320 North Broadway. Change request is a B31 community shopping district to C21 motor vehicle related district. John Fritsche, welcome.

[Speaker 50] (3:13:21 - 3:14:05)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman. I'd hope to still be saying good morning, but good afternoon, Mr. Chairman. As you said, this is a zoning change for the property at 6320 North Broadway from a B31 to a C21.

Let me first clarify, I apologize, John Fritsche for the record on behalf of the applicant. The rezoning is sought solely for use purposes as an initial step toward filing a special use application to establish a social equity dispensary at the location. We've been working for months now with the Alderman and her community organization.

We have their support for this rezoning. I believe that at a minimum, they had emailed your office. I don't know if they had followed up in addition to that as well.

[Speaker 1] (3:14:06 - 3:14:22)
Yeah, we do have a letter of support from all the women in Manhattan. Yes, on file. Any questions by committee members?

All women makes the motion. I just want to say this is about a half a block south from Loyola University, Chicago. And they are not a landlord at all?

[Speaker 50] (3:14:22 - 3:14:29)
No, they are not. As a matter of fact, they just purchased the adjoining property. They are aware of this application.

[Speaker 1] (3:14:29 - 3:14:54)
That's where I was when I lived at Newgard. Oh, okay. Paying attention.

All right, all the person in front of us moves to pass. All in favor, say aye. Opposed, say nay.

Negative, the ayes have it and the item is passed. Next up is document number 22503 in the 44th ward. Ordinance referred 71724.

Common address is 3201 through 09 North Halstead Street. Change request to B31, Community Shopping District to C12, Neighborhood Commercial District. Mr. Pritchett.

[Speaker 50] (3:14:54 - 3:15:24)
Thank you again, John Pritchett on behalf of the African Oliver Entertainment. We've had lengthy conversations with the Alderman who was very difficult to deal with on this project. But that aside, Alderman, as you're aware, this is an existing property that consists of a well-known restaurant and a couple other establishments.

There's a vacant space there that they are seeking to put a new restaurant in. No additions are planned for the building. We've heard no objections when the notice letters went out and I respectfully ask for your support.

[Speaker 1] (3:15:24 - 3:15:47)
Thank you. You do have my support. This is the intersection of Belmont Halstead, sort of an anomaly that wasn't already zoned C like the rest of Halstead is.

And it's surrounded on four sides by city streets and CTA turnaround. So any questions by committee members? Seeing none, Alderman Knutson moves to pass.

All in favor, say aye. Any opposed, say nay. And the Chair, the ayes have it.

Item is passed.

[Speaker 50] (3:15:47 - 3:15:52)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. All kidding aside, thank you for your work with us on this. We appreciate it.

[Speaker 1] (3:15:52 - 3:16:54)
Much appreciated. Look forward to the new business. All right, top of page eight is document number 22528-T1 in the 47th Ward.

Ordinance was referred 71724. Common address is 3710, 3714 North Ashland Avenue. Change request, C12 Neighborhood Commercial District to B25 Neighborhood Mixed Use District.

We have attorney Corinne O'Hara. Do I have an attorney on this one? 3710 North Ashland, Corinne O'Hara, no.

All right, we will pass it and come back. Document number 22515-T1 in the 46th Ward. Ordinance referred 71724.

Common address is 936 through 942 West Leland Avenue. Change request is an RT4, Residential 2 Flat Townhouse and Multi-Unit District to B23 Neighborhood Mixed Use District. I have attorney Andrew Scott.

Aaron Dorsey filling in for Andrew Scott. There's a much younger fill in today.

[Speaker 41] (3:16:54 - 3:17:18)
Good to see you, Aaron Dorsey. See you as well. Proceed.

Good afternoon, Chairman Lawson and members of the Committee on Zoning Landmarks and Building Standards. For the record, my name is Aaron Dorsey of the law firm of Dyke & Magossett, and we represent the applicant, West Leland Avenue LLC in its application to rezone the property located at 936 to 942 West Leland Avenue. We've also submitted a substitute narrative and plans and would ask for the Committee to accept those substitutes.

[Speaker 1] (3:17:20 - 3:17:32)
We do, Alderman Ramirez moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the Type 1 application. All in favor say aye. Any opposed say nay.

Seeing that the ayes have it, substitute narrative and plans are before us.

[Speaker 41] (3:17:32 - 3:18:19)
Thank you. The applicant intends to rezone the property from RT4 to B2-3 in order to redevelop the currently vacant property into a 32-unit residential building, which will have six affordable units located onsite. As part of the map amendment application, the applicant is also requesting certain variations in the front, side, and rear yards, and a variation in the loading requirements, and an administrative adjustment to reduce the parking spaces in a transit-serve location.

The applicant has had meetings with the community and the Uptown Chamber of Commerce, and we have sent out the required notice to surrounding property owners, and have not received any opposition to the application. We've also worked with Alderwoman Clay regarding this project, which led to an increase in the number of affordable units located onsite. And we have also received a letter of support from Alderwoman Clay, which I believe should be on file.

[Speaker 1] (3:18:21 - 3:18:26)
We do have a letter of support from Alderwoman Clay, and she has just rejoined the meeting. If you'd like to add anything on this one.

[Speaker 44] (3:18:27 - 3:19:11)
Oh, I'm so excited to see this part of my ward be redeveloped. You all, it's been vacant for over a decade. It is on a beautiful historic block that has my alma mater, Uplift Community High School, just a few hundred feet away.

We actually had a great conversation with the developer, because obviously affordability has become a grave issue in the 46th Ward, and they were very cooperative with wanting to add more affordable units onsite. So I'm very ecstatic that we were able to have a great working relationship that includes having affordable units onsite in this particular part of our ward. So really looking forward to this project.

[Speaker 1] (3:19:13 - 3:19:57)
Thank you, Alderwoman Clay. I know this area well, and I'm happy to see the investment there. I know it's taken some time, but any questions by committee members?

Seeing none, Alderwoman Dowell moves do pass with the substitute narrative and plans. All in favor, say aye. Opposed, say nay.

Let me show the ayes have it, item is passed. We're gonna go back real quick to page four, Aldermack Amendment in the 46th Ward. Document number A8899 in the 46th Ward.

Ordinance referred, 61224. Common address is 4116 North Clark Street. Change request is an RS3, residential single unit detached house district to B31, community shopping district.

Alderwoman Angela Clay.

[Speaker 44] (3:19:57 - 3:21:01)
Yeah, so this particular parcel used to be a 711 in my neck of the woods, and it has been sitting vacant. Prime real estate, you all, in a part that has Clark Street. It also is close to Blaine Elementary.

The development that is going up here is called Access Contemporary Music, where they will be teaching folks as young as four to 104 how to play classical music. It comes with onsite parking that they are also going to be renting out for extra funds. And then we also passed a liquor moratorium so that they are able to serve alcohol during shows.

I'm really excited about this. We worked with the nearby community organizations and chambers to make sure that we got this right, made sure that we had full commitment that we will be dropping this liquor moratorium in another year because it is solely for this parcel. But I'm super excited to see this redeveloped with a organization who's really committed to helping the community and nearby neighbors.

So, would love your support.

[Speaker 1] (3:21:03 - 3:21:47)
Great, thank you so much, Alderwoman Clay. I know we had a speaker on that and the letter is in the packet as well. Any questions by committee members?

Seeing none, all the person who points as moves do pass. All in favor, say aye. All opposed, say nay.

Seeing the Chair, the ayes have it and the item is passed. Thank you. All right, returning back to the order.

We're at the bottom of page eight, document number 22513 in the 38th Ward, ordinance referred 71724. Common address is 6D14 through 16 West Addison Street. Change requests, B31, Community Shopping District to B22, Neighborhood Mixed Use District.

We have Attorney Lisa Duarte.

[Speaker 48] (3:21:48 - 3:22:35)
Thank you, Chairman Lawson. For the record, Lisa Duarte here with Point of Difference Strategies. I am here representing Property Appearance LTD.

We are here regarding the property at 6014 through 6016 West Addison Street. It's currently zoned as a B3-1 Community Shopping District. We're asking that the zoning be changed to a B2-2 Mixed Use District to legalize an existing lower level second dwelling unit, which would result in a total of two dwelling units within the existing two-level building.

Letters went out, we've received no opposition, and I believe a letter of support from Alderman Sposato has been submitted.

[Speaker 1] (3:22:36 - 3:23:10)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Sposato for this crazy two-unit building. Any questions by committee members? Seeing none, all the women claim moves do pass.

All in favor, say aye. Any opposed, say nay. In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it, and the item is passed.

Moving on to the top of page nine. Document number is 22512 in the 22nd Ward. Ordinance referred, 7-17-24.

Common address is 2611 South Lawndale Avenue. Change request, B3-2 Community Shopping District to B2-2 Neighborhood Mixed Use District. Once again, Lisa Duarte.

[Speaker 48] (3:23:10 - 3:23:44)
Thank you, and Mr. Chair, I'd also like to acknowledge we've got Zoning Consultant Gerald Garcia sitting to my right. Welcome. Here we are seeking a zoning amendment from a B3-2 Community Shopping District to a B2-2 Neighborhood Mixed Use District to allow for the conversion of a vacant office space on the ground floor into a second dwelling unit, again, for a total of two dwelling units within an existing two-story building.

We have issued letters of notice. We received no opposition, and I understand that Alderman Rodriguez has expressed his support for this amendment to the Chair.

[Speaker 1] (3:23:44 - 3:23:57)
Yes, we do have a letter of support from Alderman Rodriguez. Any questions by committee members? Seeing none, all the amendments do pass.

All in favor say aye. Aye. All opposed, nay.

In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it. Item is passed. Thank you.

[Speaker 48] (3:23:57 - 3:23:57)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:23:57 - 3:24:31)
Very much. Middle of page nine is document number 2-2-3-2-3. In the third ward, the ordinance referred 1-24-24.

Common address is 4301 through 4453 South Federal, 4300 to 4452 South Dearborn, 4301 to 4453 South Dearborn, 4330 to 4452 South State Street. Change request is plan development 1135 as amended to plan development 1135 as amended. We have Attorney Steve Freedland and our friends from the CHA.

[Speaker 23] (3:24:32 - 3:26:13)
Yes, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. My name is Steve Freedland with Applegate and Thorntops, and here with me today, all the way at the end, is a representative of the Applicant CHA. Whitney Houston is here.

Also, this matter and the next matter that you're going to hear relate to the latest redevelopment of the Robert Taylor Homes, which is owned by CHA. My clients, Brinshaw Development Company and Michaels Development have been joint venture partners with the CHA for a number of years on several prior developments in Robert Taylor Homes, and this is one of them. Also with me is our architect, Matthew McGrane.

The matter before you is simply, and I don't know if you've got our slides, but it doesn't. I can explain this. The existing plan development 1135, when it was passed, 45th Street did not exist.

If you go to the next slide. And basically there was a mis-measurement of 10 feet so that the south boundary of this plan development, which was intended to be 45th Street, went 10 feet too far. So it's actually within the next matter you're going to hear.

So the purpose of this amendment was simply to correct that change and make 45th Street the southern boundary of the plan development, which it has always been. With that, we certainly would take any questions and. Great.

[Speaker 1] (3:26:14 - 3:26:41)
Alderman McDowell is going to move. Actually, I'm sorry. The item was heard and passed by the Chicago Plan Commission.

Yes, thank you. Alderman McDowell makes a motion to incorporate all records and findings from that hearing. All in favor, say aye.

Aye. Any opposed, nay. The ayes have it.

Records are incorporated. Alderman McDowell further makes a motion to approve this measure. All in favor, say aye.

Any opposed, say nay. The ayes have it. This is passed as revised.

Thank you.

[Speaker 23] (3:26:42 - 3:26:42)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:26:43 - 3:27:06)
We'll go to the next item then. Document number 22105 in the third ward, ordinance referred 31523. Common address is 4500 through 4556 South State Street, one through 21 West 45th Street.

Change request, RT4, residential two-flat townhouse multi-unit district to B23, neighborhood mixed-use district, and then to plan development. Mr. Friedland.

[Speaker 23] (3:27:06 - 3:28:21)
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Again, Steve Friedland with Applegate and Thorne Thompson here on behalf of the applicant, the Chicago Housing Authority. Again, with me, Whitney Houston, and also the developers of the project represented by Andrea Keeney from Michaels Development and Matthew McCrane from LBBA Architects.

This is, you can probably go to the next slide. This, maybe even the next slide, just to give you a sense. This is a redevelopment of the next block of the old Robert Taylor Homes.

What is before you is a three area, three sub-area proposed development. The first sub-area, sub-area A, proposes 52 units of housing. Over 80% of those will be affordable.

It'll be 21 CHA replacement units, 21 tax credit units, and 10 market rate units. They will be developed in a four-story building with 40 units and a walk-up building, three-story walk-up with 12 units. We did appear before the Chicago Plan Commission on August 15th.

And as you did with the prior matter, we would request that you incorporate the record and findings of the Plan Commission.

[Speaker 1] (3:28:21 - 3:28:29)
Alderman Hopkins makes a motion to incorporate all records and findings from that hearing. All in favor, say aye. Aye.

Any opposed, say nay. Voting share the ayes have it. The records are incorporated.

[Speaker 23] (3:28:29 - 3:29:05)
And I think you can see there are a few images that are being shown right now. This is the four-story building. And then the next image is the three-story walk-up building, if it switches.

Again, this area is currently vacant land. And this is the next phase of the redevelopment of Robert Taylor. We certainly appreciate all the assistance that Alderman Dow gave to this project.

And I know she's here, she can speak on it to the extent that you have any questions of our witnesses, we're happy to take. Thank you. Alderman Dow, anything to add?

[Speaker 34] (3:29:06 - 3:29:49)
Yes, this project we've worked on for a long time. It's been through a community process. Residents of existing community have also reviewed this proposal.

I'm pleased that we have a lot of participation from MBE, African-American companies, both on the architecture side. I know Landon Bonebaker is here as well. Engage Civil, which is a local company in the ward, resident of the ward.

And GMA Construction to do the work. So I would ask the committee to favorably move on this. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:29:50 - 3:29:59)
Thank you. Alderman Clay. Alderman Clay moves do pass.

All in favor say aye. Aye. I'm sorry.

Alderman Dow.

[Speaker 34] (3:30:00 - 3:30:14)
I just wanted to thank the Chicago Housing Authority and the Department of Housing and Brent Shaw Michaels for their work on this as well. Thorne Thompson, Thorne, you know.

[Speaker 1] (3:30:16 - 3:30:18)
Great, thank you. Anything else?

[Speaker 34] (3:30:19 - 3:30:19)
Nope.

[Speaker 1] (3:30:19 - 3:31:05)
Great. Alderman Clay moves do pass. All in favor say aye.

Aye. All opposed say nay. Making sure the ayes have it.

And it's passed as revised. Thank you very much. Top of page 10 is document number 22492 in the sixth ward.

Ordinance referred 71724. Common address is 631 West 81st Street and 650 West 83rd Street. Change requests.

M32 heavy industry district and industrial plan development number 1443 to M32 heavy industry district and M32 heavy industry district to industrial plan development 1443 as amended. We have attorney Meg George, or Matthew Ali is here today.

[Speaker 46] (3:31:10 - 3:31:46)
Thank you Mr. Chairman and good afternoon members of the committee. For the record, my name is Matthew Ali with the law from the Aikerman LLP with offices located at 71 South Wacker Drive which represents the applicant for this matter Green Area Educational NFP. Earlier today, I did have Erica Allen, the president of Green Area Educational NFP with me.

Regrettably, she did have to leave for another meeting but she does send her regards. As a preliminary matter, this application was considered and recommended for approval at the August 15th, 2024 meeting of the Chicago Plan Commission. And we request that the transcript from that hearing be incorporated into the record for today's proceeding.

[Speaker 1] (3:31:47 - 3:31:56)
Alderman Clay makes a motion to incorporate all records and findings from that hearing. All in favor say aye. Aye.

Any opposed say nay. Chair, the ayes have it, records are incorporated.

[Speaker 46] (3:31:56 - 3:33:06)
Thank you, Chair. As a brief summary of this project, in 2019, the Chicago City Council approved industrial plan development 1443 to facilitate Green Area's proposal to construct a new anaerobic digester facility, visitor center, urban agricultural area, and community area. The anaerobic digester is now partially operational and given that approximately half of the food waste being brought to the campus is in liquid form, the campus now needs to expand to accommodate additional detention capacity, which is required in order to obtain city and state permits to allow for the full operational capacity of the digester.

Green Area now seeks to expand its campus to the north to encompass an additional approximately 190,000 square feet or approximately 4.4 acres of site area. It is this additional PD site area that requires this proposed amendment to the PD. No new buildings or structures are being proposed.

Green Area's proposed PD expansion has the support of local Alderman William Hall, who has provided a letter of support for this application. Finally, we appreciate this committee's consideration and request your support of this proposal. We are available for any questions you may have.

[Speaker 1] (3:33:07 - 3:33:54)
Thank you very much. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Hall. I would like you to send me a link to an anaerobic digester.

I will. I'll learn a little bit more there. That sounds interesting.

Any questions by committee members? Seeing none, I'll just see Joe Lopez moves to pass. We incorporated the records?

We did. Yes. All in favor, say aye.

Aye. Any opposed, say nay. Any chair, the ayes have it.

It's passed as revised. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Early. Next up is document number 22506-T1 of the 27th Ward. Ordinance referred, 7-17-24. Common address is 595 to, I'm sorry, 495 to 499 North Milwaukee Avenue.

Change request, M-2-3, Light Industry District to DX-3, Downtown Mixed Use District. We have Katie Janke-Dale.

[Speaker 45] (3:33:55 - 3:34:47)
Thank you. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Katie Janke-Dale from the law firm of DLA Piper.

We represent the applicant in this matter, which is RV Ventures LLC, an affiliate of Volca Group. The site's an existing restaurant located at 495 North Milwaukee that's known as the Pearl Club. The requested change is a technical amendment to establish a DX-3 Downtown Mixed Use District that would allow for the issuance of a PPA for certain limited live music performances.

We've worked very closely with the local neighborhood group, Neighbors of River West and Alderman Burnett on this request. And as a result, we entered into a binding plan of operation with the local neighborhood group that would go into effect with the license issuance. There also is a substitute ordinance, which would allow for the ordinance to be made effective a month early so we can enhance the prospects of having limited entertainment in connection with the forthcoming holiday season.

We'd request that the committee accept that substitute.

[Speaker 1] (3:34:48 - 3:34:56)
Alder Hopkins makes a motion to accept the substitute ordinance. All in favor, say aye. Aye.

All opposed, say nay. Finish it. Ayes have it.

The substitute is before us.

[Speaker 45] (3:34:56 - 3:35:00)
Thank you. That concludes our testimony, but I'm available for any questions. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:35:00 - 3:35:32)
Got it. So we gotta get open by the holidays, right? That's the goal.

Any questions by committee members? Seeing none, all the claimants do pass. All in favor, say aye.

Aye. All opposed, say nay. Item is passed as substituted.

Thank you. Next up, document number 22476 of the 27th ward. Ordinance referred 6-12-24.

Common address 1140 West Erie. Change request, residential business plan development number 1480 to residential business plan development number 1480. Once again, Katie Jenke-Dale.

[Speaker 45] (3:35:33 - 3:35:50)
Thank you again for the record, Katie Jenke-Dale from DLA Piper. We represent 1140 West Erie LLC, which is an affiliate of the Bond Companies. As a preliminary matter, this application was considered and recommended for approval at the July 18th plan commission hearing.

We would request that the transcript from that hearing be incorporated into the record.

[Speaker 1] (3:35:51 - 3:36:00)
Alderman Hopkins makes a motion to incorporate all hearings and findings from the plan commission hearing. All in favor, say aye. All opposed, say nay.

Fitting share, the ayes have it, and the records are incorporated.

[Speaker 45] (3:36:01 - 3:36:35)
Thank you. Again, this is a relatively technical amendment to the existing plan development. The site is located in the Westtown neighborhood, bounded by Ogden, May, and Erie.

There's no changes to the building proposed. We are simply seeking to amend the PD to allow for additional uses in the immediate case for a dog groomer tenant in the building on the ground floor. The building's already been constructed, and as I said, no physical changes are proposed.

Again, we met with the neighbors of River West on this request, as well as Alderman Burnett. And with that, I'm available for any questions. Thank you again.

[Speaker 1] (3:36:36 - 3:36:50)
We do have a lot of support from Alderman Burnett. I don't think he joined us on the Zoom. Any questions by committee members?

Seeing none, all the women claim moves do pass. All in favor, say aye. All opposed, say nay.

Fitting share, the ayes have it, and the records, it is passed as revised.

[Speaker 45] (3:36:51 - 3:36:51)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:36:51 - 3:37:27)
Thank you, Katie. All right, top of page 11. Document number 22317 in the second ward.

Ordinance referred, 12-13-23. Common address is 749 through 757 West North Avenue, 1551 through 1577 North Halstead Street, 1555 through 1569 North Clyburn Avenue, and 732 to 754 West Weed Street. Change requests.

Business plan development number 834 to B35 Community Shopping District, and then to a residential business plan development. We have attorney Paul Shadle.

[Speaker 52] (3:37:28 - 3:37:54)
Morning, Mr., or afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. I'm Paul Shadle with the law firm of DLA Piper in Chicago, and along with my partner, Mario Degrino, I represent the applicant in this matter, LPC Chicago LLC, and our client, the developer, Paul Apollonio, also is here, if you have any questions. The application was considered during the July 18th meeting of the plan commission and recommended for approval, and we'd request that the transcript from that hearing be incorporated into the record.

[Speaker 1] (3:37:54 - 3:38:03)
Alder Knudsen makes a motion to incorporate all records and findings from that hearing. All in favor, say aye. Aye.

All opposed, say nay. Fitting share, the ayes have it, and the records are incorporated. Please continue.

[Speaker 52] (3:38:03 - 3:38:49)
The site is located at 1565 North Clybourne at the intersection of North and Halstead Streets, or North Avenue and Halstead Street. The site is very well served by transit, directly across the street from a red line stop and adjacent to a number of bus lines. It's currently part of a retail project that includes a design within reach, for example, and other retailers and a freestanding parking garage.

The proposed building would go on the site of what is a shuttered Bank of America. The applicant, as you noted, Mr. Chair, seeks an amendment to the PD to allow this new building, which would have 37 stories and contain 396 dwelling units, along with ground floor retail. Happy to answer any other questions and would respectfully request your approval.

[Speaker 1] (3:38:50 - 3:38:54)
Great, thank you. We do have Alderman Hopkins. Would wanna add anything on this?

[Speaker 31] (3:38:56 - 3:41:38)
Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm in full support of this proposal. We've engaged in an extensive community review process, along with extensive interaction with the development team, made some significant improvements.

As you can see, the design of the structure, it's a relatively attractive high-rise design. Will blend in nice with the neighborhood. It will be, I will acknowledge, taller than anything in the immediate surrounding area.

But nevertheless, we tried to go with a thinner profile that will blend in nicely with the community. It is a TOD, since it is located next to the L-stop. It's keeping the existing parking structure, which is fortunate in a program like this.

Typically, you'd have to build new parking. In this case, we don't. There's existing parking, which makes it possible to fold this right into the existing conditions.

Furthermore, we do have a situation there where pedestrians are actively crossing this intersection, because you've got the red line station right there. So we're looking to make some pedestrian improvements and some traffic flow improvements. You also have a Starbucks and an Apple store right there.

So it's a recipe for illegal parking. You have lane restrictions by people parking there constantly, trying to get into either the Apple store or the Starbucks, or dropping someone off at the L station. So we asked the developer to provide a traffic study with recommendations for how to address that.

That traffic study was submitted, and it did include specific recommendations for how we can enhance the city's existing pilot program for illegal travel lane restrictions. When you have people parking and blocking traffic on an important corridor like Clyburn, which is adjacent to this site, it really causes a great deal of congestion. And that is something that enforcement must be part of the solution.

And this new automated enforcement pilot program that the city is implementing, I have high hopes for. I think it's going to make a difference, and this will be an ideal test laboratory to show the before and after picture and how this enhanced enforcement program can stop illegal street obstruction and help the traffic flow continue to move in an important three-way corridor like this, where you've got Clyburn, you've got North, and you've got Halsted. So this is one of those areas where increased density will actually help alleviate traffic congestion rather than cause it, if all the pieces of this puzzle are allowed to be assembled properly as we think they are.

So I'm very supportive of this program. I think it's an excellent addition to the neighborhood, and we look forward to your support. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:41:39 - 3:42:37)
Thank you, Alderman Hopkins. I know the area well, and I think we're all happy to see pedestrian and traffic improvements, right? As things have gotten built, I don't know that it's ever been taken in a comprehensive way.

So I definitely appreciate you doing that. And also, we all want to see what auto enforcement looks like. So hopefully it's very successful.

Any other questions by committee members? Seeing none, all the votes and moves do pass. All in favor say aye.

Aye. All opposed say nay. Item is passed as revised.

Thank you. Going to the bottom of page 11, it's document number 22328 in the 45th board, ordinance referred 12424. Common address is 3955 North Kilpatrick, 3865 North Milwaukee Avenue.

The change request is an RS3, residential single unit detached house district to be B33, community shopping district, and then to a residential business plan development. We have attorney Sarah Barnes.

[Speaker 7] (3:42:38 - 3:43:40)
Good afternoon, vice chair and esteemed members of the committee who remain. I always tell my clients to hope for an anti-climatic final hearing. So I guess we got what we hoped for.

I am super happy to finally be here today in front of you all though, on behalf of the applicant and property owner, GW Six Corners LLC. We appeared before the Chicago Plan Commission for this project and were approved by the same on March 21st, 2024. Subsequent there to a revised PD application and other supplemental materials incorporating and memorializing commitments from that plan commission hearing were tendered to the Department of Planning and Development and to Alderman Gardner.

We do ask that the transcripts of all such proceedings and the corresponding documentation, please be entered into and adopted into the record here today.

[Speaker 1] (3:43:41 - 3:43:50)
Thank you. Alderman Ramirez-Rosa makes a motion to incorporate all records and findings from that hearing. All in favor say aye.

Aye. All opposed say nay. The ayes have it.

The records are incorporated.

[Speaker 7] (3:43:50 - 3:49:49)
Thank you so much. The property in question, the subject property is the Old People's Gas Site at the heart of the Portage Park and Irving Park neighborhoods. After over three years of very active engagement and collaboration with the Old Irving Park and Portage Park communities, we are super happy to bring to this esteemed committee a proposal for the reactivation of this enduringly vacant site with a new mixed use development complex.

The programming for the new proposed development, which has almost unanimous support from the most immediately impacted and interested members of the community as heard during public comments calls for the construction of four single story commercial buildings along the Kilpatrick and Irving Park frontages. Such commercial buildings will contain the visible tenant spaces for restaurants, hospitality ventures, and other local businesses intended to serve the residents of the immediate area. These commercial tenants will share 125 vehicular parking spaces, which will be available for their employees and patrons in a new landscaped surface parking lot with direct access off of Irving Park and Kilpatrick Avenue.

The programming for the development also calls for the construction of a five story residential building that will generally comprise the south half of the site with frontage on Kilpatrick Avenue and Milwaukee Avenue. Such residential building will feature a total of 346 dwelling units, including 69 affordable units consisting of a diverse mix of unit types with an array of amenities and communal spaces intended for the exclusive use of the residential tenants of the complex. Off street parking for 205 vehicles will be provided within the core of the new residential building, along with bicycle storage and electric vehicle charging stations and 27 additional surface parking spaces behind the building that will be reserved for visitors.

As alluded to in my summary, the development team started this journey with Alderman Gardner back in the summer of 2021. And we have been keeping up our communications and going back and forth to the drawing table with members of the Portage Park Neighborhood Association, Old Irving Park Association and Portage Park Chamber of Commerce for the last three years, coming up with the program for this, for the reactivation of this site. And I'll move towards those same ends just real quickly because these were the changes that were implemented as a result of the plan commission hearing, as a result of the collaborative journey with all the various stakeholders, the city's department, including the city's Department of Planning and the Department of Housing, as well as Alderman Gardner.

We are pleased to note some important commitments that the developer has made towards the success and longevity of the project. As originally proposed and generally accepted by the Alderman and community liaisons, the applicant had committed to provide at least 15% of the total number of housing units as affordable and on site while contributing over $2.6 million into the city's Affordable Housing Opportunity Fund, which was to go for funding of additional new affordable projects throughout the 45th ward. At the plan commission hearing, however, we heard echoed desires from both the commissioners and interested citizens that it was preferred to have all 20% of the ARO units placed on site.

As such, and in consideration of such purposeful interests and needs, the applicant committed on the record to revise the subject plan development application to provide all 20% or 69 ARO units on site. This commitment has been reflected in the revised plan development statements and corresponding ARO housing profile form that are a part of the record. In addition, there are two, and in consideration of the city's inclusionary goals, the applicant has also renewed his commitment as acknowledged in the accompanying documentation to actively solicit bids from and offer preference to WBE, MBE and union labor organizations so that 100% of the construction contracts for this project will go to such organizations and two to residents of the city of the 45th ward. Such commitment was further memorialized in a project labor agreement cooperatively executed by the applicant and developer, Mr. Bolt sitting next to me and the Chicago and Cook County Building and Construction Trade Council as further acknowledged by the officers of 21 local labor organizations, each of whom also signed the agreement. It is anticipated that over $100 million in construction contracts will be granted as a part of this project, yielding upwards of 750 new construction jobs. As indicated during my introduction, the project with these commitments was approved by the Chicago Plan Commission at their public hearing, pursuant to a positive recommendation from the Department of Planning. We also have letters of support from at least three community organizations representing the Portage Park and Irving Park neighborhood communities, as well as the corroborated testimony from the members who spoke here today.

And two, since Alderman Gardner is off exercising his other duties tending to another committee hearing, he has provided a letter of support that should be on record with the committee. With all of this, the applicant very respectfully and humbly seeks the consideration and approval of this theme committee.

[Speaker 1] (3:49:50 - 3:50:01)
Thank you, Ms. Barnes. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Gardner. I know this has been a work in progress.

Any questions by committee members? Seeing none, Alder Ciccio-Lopez moves do pass. All in favor, say aye.

[Speaker 7] (3:50:01 - 3:50:02)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (3:50:02 - 3:50:05)
All opposed, say nay. Making sure the ayes have it, it's passed as revised.

[Speaker 7] (3:50:06 - 3:50:06)

[Speaker 1] (3:50:06 - 3:50:25)
Thank you, best of luck. All right, top of page 12 is document number 22507 in the 12th Ward. Ordinance referred 71724.

Common address is 3800 South Kedzie Avenue. Change request is B3-1 Community Shopping District to B3-2 Community Shopping District. And we have Rolando Acosta.

[Speaker 17] (3:50:26 - 3:50:27)
How are you, Mr. Chairman?

[Speaker 1] (3:50:27 - 3:50:27)
Good to see you.

[Speaker 17] (3:50:28 - 3:51:14)
Good afternoon, Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant. The subject property is on the southwest corner of 38th and South Kedzie Avenue. It is improved with a partial two-story, partial one-story building.

There is one dwelling unit on the upper floors. The applicant wishes to split that unit into two units. That has triggered the requirement for the rezoning so that we can reduce the MLA for the property.

The ground floor of the property is currently a commercial space. It will remain a commercial space, but it will be divided into four smaller spaces so they can be rented to small businesses in the neighborhood. This went through an extensive community process under the auspices of Alderman Alder Rodriguez-Ramirez.

She, I believe, has submitted a letter of support for this matter. We are happy to answer any questions you may have.

[Speaker 1] (3:51:15 - 3:51:50)
Thank you. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Rodriguez-Ramirez. She was sticking it out, but I think she has left us for the moment.

Any questions by committee members? Seeing none, all the person points as moves do pass. All in favor, say aye.

Aye. All opposed, say nay. Please ensure the ayes have it and the item will be reported out.

[Speaker 1] (3:52:22 - 3:52:33)
Excuse me. Thank you. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Mitts.

Next up is document number 22526 of the 28th Ward. Ordinance referred 71724. Common address is 739-41 South California Avenue.

Change request, B32 Community Shopping District to B22 Neighborhood Mixed Use District. Once again, Mark Kupiec.

[Speaker 53] (3:52:56 - 3:53:33)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My name is Mark Kupiec. I'm the attorney for the applicant.

This is affecting the property 739-41 South California Avenue in the 28th Ward. Subject property, it's a double lot. And it's improved with an old mixed use building with two commercial units on the ground floor.

Those two units are vacant. They've been vacant for a while. Owner's been not able to rent them.

So he's seeking a zoning change so he could take those two units on the ground floor, convert them to residential units. And he had met with Alderman Irvin to explain the project and ask for Alderman Irvin's support.

[Speaker 1] (3:53:33 - 3:53:37)
I believe we have that letter, but just forward it to us just in case.

[Speaker 53] (3:53:37 - 3:53:42)
I thought he sent it directly because he was unavailable last week.

[Speaker 1] (3:53:43 - 3:54:00)
Nicole, Alderman Irvin weighed in on this item on California. I know it. Great, I know he popped in earlier.

Great. Any other questions by committee members? Seeing none, Alderman Cedric Lopez moves to pass.

[Speaker 13] (3:55:23 - 3:56:06)
Good afternoon, Chairman, members of the committee. For the record, Fred Augustin. I'm an attorney with the law office of Sam Banks at 221 Northwest South Street.

I'm here on behalf of the applicant, Maria Primero. Applicant is the owner of the property at 1810 North Richmond. The property is currently improved with a residential two-flat.

We would like to amend the current zoning from the current RS3 district to an RM4.5 district. The reason for this change, Chairman, is we're keeping the two-flat. The applicant would like to incorporate additional square footage on the second floor in the attic, so that's the reason for the change.

We have worked with Alderwoman Fuentes and her office on this matter. I believe she's in support. I know she's present here today.

I also have a letter of support from her office as well.

[Speaker 1] (3:56:09 - 3:56:12)
Thank you, we do have a letter of support. Alderperson Fuentes, anything you wanna add?

[Speaker 26] (3:56:13 - 3:56:23)
All zoning matters that appear before this committee go through my community-driven zoning process. I submitted the letter of support and I'm in support of the zoning change. I motion to pass.

[Speaker 1] (3:56:24 - 3:56:54)
Great, Alderwoman Fuentes moves to pass. All in favor say aye. Aye.

And they both say nay. They can share the ayes have it. Item is passed.

Moving on to top of 14, document number 22529-T1 of the 33rd Ward. Ordinance referred, 71724. Common addresses 3316 through 18 West Montrose Avenue.

Change request, B3-1, Community Shopping District and B2-3, Neighborhood Mixed Use District. We have, once again, Fred Augustin.

[Speaker 13] (3:56:54 - 3:57:22)
Again, Chairman, for the record, Fred Augustin. I'm here on behalf of the applicant, Montrose Estate LLC. The applicant owns the property at 3316 to 18 West Montrose.

Property is currently vacant. The applicant plans to redevelop the property with a new four-story mixed-use building containing commercial space at grade, 25 units above, as well as off-street parking for 17 cars. We did submit substitute narrative and plans.

I would like that incorporated into the record.

[Speaker 1] (3:57:22 - 3:57:32)
Alderman Cecil Lopez moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the Type 1 application. All in favor, say aye. Aye.

Opposed, say nay. Please ensure that the ayes have it. The substitute narrative and plans are accepted.

[Speaker 13] (3:57:33 - 3:58:01)
And then, Chairman, of course, as you stated, we are seeking to rezone the property from the current B3-1, Community Shopping District to a B2-3, Neighborhood Mixed Use District. Since this is a Type 1 application, we're also seeking relief to increase the parking, reduce the rear setback, as well as waive the loading perk. We have worked with Alderman Rodriguez and her office on this matter.

We had an extensive community process. All are in support. I do have a letter of support from the office, as well.

[Speaker 1] (3:58:02 - 3:58:35)
Thank you. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Rodriguez-Sanchez. Any questions on this item?

Seeing none, Alderman Rosa moves to pass as revised. All in favor, say aye. Opposed, say nay.

Please ensure the ayes have it. It's passed with the substitute narrative and plans. Document number 22517-T1 on the 11th Ward.

Ordinance referred, 71724. Common address is 2340-44 South Wentworth Avenue. Change request, C13, Neighborhood Commercial District to C15, Neighborhood Commercial District.

Fred Augustin.

[Speaker 13] (3:58:36 - 3:59:27)
Again, Chairman, for the record, Fred Augustin. I'm here on behalf of the applicant Wu Tran, Chinatown LLC. Applicant owns a property at 2340-44 South Wentworth.

Property is currently improved with a three-story mixed-use building. The original plan was to develop the property with a new five-story mixed-use building containing commercial space at grade and four dwelling units above. That was our plan when we originally filed the application.

Since then, we have reevaluated the project. We decided to add units, so we amended our plans to reflect a six-story mixed-use building containing commercial space in the first through fourth floors, as well as eight dwelling units on the fifth and sixth floors. We did submit an amended application that included notice, as well as substitute narrative and plans.

I'd like that incorporated into the record.

[Speaker 1] (3:59:28 - 3:59:37)
Yes, Alder Fuentes moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for type one application. All in favor say aye. Aye.

Any opposed say nay. Please make sure the ayes have it. Substitute narrative and plans are before us.

[Speaker 13] (3:59:37 - 4:00:12)
And as you stated, we are seeking to rezone the property from a C13 district to a C15. It's for a six-story mixed-use building. Again, first through fourth floors will contain commercial spaces, and the fifth and sixth floor will contain eight units.

This is a type one application. We're also seeking relief for the parking, building height, loading, pedestrian street, FAR, and then rear setback. We have worked with Alderman Woman Lee and her office on this matter.

We had a community meeting. All of her in support. I do have a copy of a letter of support from the Alderman's office, if you need it.

[Speaker 1] (4:00:13 - 4:00:48)
Thank you. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Lee. Any questions by committee members?

Seeing none, all the women dial moves do pass as the substitute narrative and plans. All in favor, say aye. Aye.

Any opposed, say nay. Make sure the ayes have it. Substitute narrative and plans are approved.

Bottom of page 14 is document number 22519-T1 in the first ward. Ordinance referred, 71724. Common address is 1235 through 37 North Ashland Avenue.

Change request, B23, neighborhood mixed-use district to B23, neighborhood mixed-use district. Fred Augustin.

[Speaker 13] (4:00:48 - 4:02:11)
Again, Chairman, for the record, Fred Augustin. On behalf of the applicant, NOAA Properties LLC, the applicant is the contract purchaser of the property at 1235 to 37 North Ashland. It's currently improved with a one and two-story commercial buildings, as well as a three-story mixed-use building.

Just for clarification of history, back in June, 2023, this committee approved a type one rezoning from a B32 to a B23 district for a similar type of project. It was a five-story mixed-use building containing commercial space at grade, 16 units above, as well as four off-street parking spaces. That project never proceeded.

The applicant is proposing a similar project. However, since it is a different design and different architect, we are here, back before the committee, on a type one zoning change. So with that, we are seeking to rezone the property from the current B23 district to a B23 district.

This will allow, again, for a new five-story mixed-use building containing commercial space at grade, 16 units above, as well as 10 off-street parking spaces. Type one application, we are also seeking relief for the off-street parking requirement, as well as reducing the rear setback. We have worked with Alderman LaSpada in his office on this matter.

I believe you should have a letter of support from Alderman LaSpada.

[Speaker 1] (4:02:11 - 4:02:47)
Thank you, Fred. We do have a letter of support from Alderman LaSpada on this. Any questions by committee members?

Seeing none, Alderman Cicero-Lopez moves to pass. All in favor, say aye. Opposed, say nay.

Finish your ayes, have it. And the item is passed. Finally, document number, well, finally for Fred.

Sorry, I don't get excited. Document number 22527-T1 in the first ward, ordinance referred 71724. Common address is 1257 through 1301 North Ashland Avenue.

Change request, B23, neighborhood mixed-use district to B23, neighborhood mixed-use district. Once again, Fred Augustin.

[Speaker 13] (4:02:47 - 4:03:38)
Again, Chairman, for the record, Fred Augustin. On behalf of the applicant, NOAA Properties LLC, the applicant is the contract purchaser of the property at 1257 to 1301 North Ashland. This situation is very similar to the one I just explained.

Committee approved the type one rezoning back in March of 2023 from a B32 district to a B23 district for a mixed-use building with commercial space at grade, 24 units above, and 10 off-street parking spaces. Again, that project never proceeded. Applicant is taking over the property and his design is different from what was previously approved.

However, similar type of density and project. With that, we are seeking a zoning from the current B23 district to the B23 district as well. And I believe we have substitute narrative and plans on this.

[Speaker 1] (4:03:39 - 4:03:50)
We do. Alderman Ramirez-Rosa moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type one application. All in favor, say aye.

Aye. Any opposed, say nay. Meeting chair, the ayes have it.

Substitute narrative and plans are accepted.

[Speaker 13] (4:03:51 - 4:04:10)
Again, the change is for a five-story mixed-use building containing commercial space at grade, 24 units above, as well as 10 off-street parking spaces. It's part of the type one application. We're also seeking relief for the off-street parking, as well as the rear setback.

We have worked with Alderman LaSpada and his office on this matter. Again, I believe you should have a letter of support.

[Speaker 1] (4:04:11 - 4:04:22)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman LaSpada. Alder Fuentes makes the motion do pass with a substitute narrative and plans. All in favor, say aye.

Any opposed, say nay. Meeting chair, the ayes have it. And the item is passed.

[Speaker 13] (4:04:22 - 4:04:22)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (4:04:22 - 4:04:47)
Thank you, Mr. Augustin. All right, middle of 15 is document number 22496-T1. In the 30th Ward.

Ordinance referred 71724. Common address is 3520 through 3522 North Pulaski Road. Change request is B31 Community Shopping District to B23 Neighborhood Mixed-Use District.

We have Agnes Plekka to present.

[Speaker 15] (4:04:52 - 4:06:53)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My name is Agnes Plekka. I'm an attorney with law firm of Jaffe and Berlin located at 111 West Chicago, West Washington, Chicago.

And I represent applicant in this case, Ted Kavula Company in the proposed rezoning from existing B3-1 Community Shopping District to a B2-3 Neighborhood Mixed-Use District. And very simply, subject property currently improved with a commercial building, which due to its functional obsolescence and lack of demand for commercial units on that stretch of Pulaski has been vacant for many years. So the applicant proposes to demolish this building and redevelop it with a new three-story residential building with eight dwelling units and six onsite parking spaces.

We need that zoning change in order to comply with the MLA and density and FAR requirements of the zoning code. And with this type of rezoning, this is a type of rezoning, and we are proceeding on the originally filed plans, but we are also asking for optional relief for administrative adjustments to increase the parking spaces from four required to six proposed, just to balance the market demands against the requirements of that new ordinance for TSL locations. And the proposed building was mindfully designed just to make sure that it fits seamlessly within the existing streetscape.

And each story will contain two large family units, a friendly unit with three bedrooms and three baths, and the applicant promised to provide one voluntary ARO unit onsite as well. We have worked very closely with Alderman Cruz, her staff, and the 30th Ward Community Advisory Committee to present this project. And the type one plans that you see today are the final result of that collaboration.

The project was well-received and supported by the community. We have a lot of support from Alderwoman Cruz. I don't know if she's still on virtually, but we are- I don't see her on.

[Speaker 1] (4:06:53 - 4:07:05)
We might've lost her, but we do have a letter of support from Alderman Cruz. Any questions by committee members? Seeing none, Alderman Ramirez-Rosa moves to pass.

All in favor, say aye. Any opposed, say nay. Making sure the ayes have it.

Item is passed.

[Speaker 15] (4:07:06 - 4:07:06)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (4:07:07 - 4:07:32)
Bottom of 15 is document number 22495-T1. That's T1 of the 4th Ward. Ordinance referred, 717.24. Common addresses, 4524-28 South Cottage Grove Avenue. Change request, B11, Neighborhood Shopping District to C13, Commercial Neighborhood District. Once again, we have Agnes Plajka.

[Speaker 15] (4:07:32 - 4:08:02)
Once again, for the record, my name is Agnes Plajka, and I represent Demira Ethiopian Restaurant LLC. I have with me Chef Rita, and this is a very exciting project. This is a type one application, and her team worked very diligently to make up the final plans.

We did have some interior changes, as well as the outdoor seating changes. So we did file substitute plans recently with Department of Planning. So we are asking to proceed on those substitute plans.

[Speaker 1] (4:08:03 - 4:08:13)
Alderman Fuentes moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type one application. All in favor, say aye. Aye.

Any opposed, say nay. Making sure the ayes have it, and the substitute narrative and plans are accepted.

[Speaker 15] (4:08:14 - 4:10:32)
Thank you, sir. Very briefly, subject property currently improved with an existing three-story old building. The applicant proposes to rehab the existing building, adaptively reuse to establish a restaurant on the ground floor with some winemaking production and wholesale approximately 8,500 square feet of commercial space.

And we are proposing to establish 14 dwelling units on the upper floors. Three of those units on site will be ARO units per the ordinance. And the proposed rehab also involves building three four-story addition for the elevator enclosure and stairway enclosure in order to comply and bring the building into compliance with the current standards of building and fire code.

We also propose a one-story and close seasonal seating area to the side of the building. So we do need that zoning change in order to comply with the FAR and density requirements of the zoning code. The property has never had any parking.

Again, we're talking about adaptive reuse of an older building. So we are asking for optional relief to allow parking reduction for transit-served location. This is a TSO location.

So we're asking to eliminate any required parking to zero. Again, since this is adaptive reuse, never had any parking, we believe that this proposed adjustment aligns with the zoning ordinance intent. Another optional relief that we're asking is to reduce the rear setback.

This is an existing building. Usually there are no rear setbacks for such buildings. However, because we are building that addition for the elevators, we are asking to reduce that 30-foot rear setback to zero.

And we have worked very closely with Alderman Robinson and his team. We had a community meeting on July 11th, which was very well attended. Again, the applicant, Chef Rita, she's been in the business of restaurant and cuisine for over 17 years, and she currently owns and operates two successful, wonderful restaurants where she shares with us the light of Ethiopian cuisine.

And we are hoping to establish this third location at the subject property. So hopefully you do have a support letter from Alderman Robinson. I do have an extra copy.

[Speaker 1] (4:10:33 - 4:10:36)
I do. I do have a letter from Alderman Robinson. However, we have no food from Chef Rita.

[Speaker 15] (4:10:36 - 4:10:37)
Oh, shoot.

[Speaker 1] (4:10:38 - 4:10:40)
So I'm going to work a hopeless course.

[Speaker 15] (4:10:40 - 4:10:40)
And at this late hour, I'm up.

[Speaker 1] (4:10:41 - 4:10:48)
Where are the hours going? No, I was going to ask, you have a restaurant on Broadway in Uptown as well, right? Where's your third location?

[Speaker 51] (4:10:49 - 4:10:52)
The Time Out Market. And this will be our third location.

[Speaker 1] (4:10:53 - 4:10:54)
Where's the Time Out Market?

[Speaker 51] (4:10:54 - 4:10:55)
In Fulton Market.

[Speaker 1] (4:10:55 - 4:10:56)
In Fulton.

[Speaker 51] (4:10:56 - 4:10:57)
Okay, great.

[Speaker 1] (4:10:57 - 4:10:58)
You've been in Uptown a very long time.

[Speaker 51] (4:10:58 - 4:10:59)
17 years.

[Speaker 1] (4:10:59 - 4:11:16)
Okay, you're a pretty young lady to be there so long. And I know it's got a great reputation. Alderman McClay was here before.

I don't think there's any questions, so Alderman Fuentes moves to pass with the substitute narrative and plans. All in favor say aye. Aye.

All opposed say nay. The chair of the ayes have it. Best of luck to you.

[Speaker 15] (4:11:16 - 4:11:18)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, members of the committee.

[Speaker 1] (4:11:19 - 4:11:51)
Wine is also acceptable. No, I'm kidding. You're making your own though, huh?

Honey wine. Oh, okay. All right, good, good.

All right, best of luck to you. Yes, thank you. All right, top of page 16 is document number 22514 in the 14th ward.

Ordinance referred 71724. Common address is 6010 through 6020 South Kedzie Avenue. Change requests, B31 Community Shopping District to C11 Neighborhood Commercial District.

I have attorney Ed Cust.

[Speaker 55] (4:11:53 - 4:12:52)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. For the record, my name is Ed Cust, an attorney with the Taft Law Firm located at 111 East Wacker in Chicago.

Joining me this afternoon to my right is Mr. Jose Ortiz, which is the applicant. He's also the owner of the subject property. We are seeking a zoning change from B3-1 to the C1-3 in order to allow Mr. Ortiz to establish an additional service, a neighborhood service in the building. The building is a commercial building, one story. He operates his neighborhood heating, cooling business there. There are three garage bays in the front.

The building is set back from the street and we would like to add a boutique hand carwash and detailing service for the neighborhood. There will only be one car at a time entering the building, very small operation, but we need the C1 in order for him to do that. There will be no new construction of any kind.

This is simply the addition of the use. We're happy to answer any questions and we kindly ask for a favorable recommendation.

[Speaker 1] (4:12:52 - 4:13:30)
Thank you. We do have support from Alderman Gutierrez. Any questions?

Seeing none, Alderman Ramirez-Rosa moves to pass. All in favor say aye. Aye.

All opposed say nay. Seeing the Chair, the ayes have it. Item passes.

Thank you very much. Middle of the page is document number 22502-T1 in the first forward. Ordinance referred 71724.

Common address is 2838 to 2840 West Shakespeare Avenue and 2148 to 2150 North Mozart Street. Change request is an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to be 23 neighborhood mixed use district. We have attorney Liz Butler.

[Speaker 27] (4:13:30 - 4:16:26)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Liz Butler. I'm a partner with the law firm of Taft, Stettinius and Hollister located at 111 East Wacker Drive in Chicago.

And I represent the applicant in this matter 2148N Mozart LLC. I'm joined today by Eric Weber, who's the principal of the applicant who is also the property owner. The applicant is requesting a rezoning of the subject property located at 2838 to 2840 West Shakespeare Avenue and 2148 to 2150 North Mozart Street from the RS3 residential single unit district to the B23 neighborhood mixed use district in order to increase the unit count at the property from eight to 12 units within the two existing non-conforming multifamily residential buildings at the property. The site is bounded by public alley to the North, North Mozart Street on the East, West Shakespeare on the South and an existing multi-unit residential building on the West.

The property consists of approximately 6,717 square feet of site area. And it's improved with, as I said, two approximately hundred year old two-story multi-unit residential buildings that are vacant. The applicant is proposing to renovate the building interiors and limited elements of the building exteriors in order to upgrade these aging and substandard residential buildings to convert underutilized storage space in the ground level or the basement of each building from storage to dwelling units.

Two dwelling units are proposed to be added to each building for a total of 12 dwelling units at the property. The building envelopes will remain unchanged. The change request to the B23 is necessary to bring the existing use, the existing FAR, the proposed unit count into conformity with zoning and will allow the applicant to undertake the proposed renovations, including the modest increase in residential density, the repair and construction of existing exterior porches.

The property has no parking spaces. It's in a transit surf location and a transit surf location parking reduction is requested as part of this type one. 12 bicycle parking spaces will be added to the buildings as part of the project.

The applicant discussed this proposal with Alderman LaSpada and participated in the first ward development review process, including presenting at a community meeting earlier this summer. And we understand that Alderman LaSpada provided either a letter or some signal of his support for the requested change. We thank the committee for its consideration of this request and we respectfully request your favorable recommendation.

We're available to answer any questions that you might have.

[Speaker 1] (4:16:27 - 4:17:14)
Great, thank you so much, Ms. Butler. Any questions by committee members? We do have a letter of support from Alderman LaSpada.

Seeing none, all the front desk moves do pass. All in favor say aye. Aye.

Any opposed say nay. Making sure the ayes have it. Best of luck with the project.

Thank you. I think I have a staff member on this block, so we'll be in touch, Eric, if there's any funny business. All right, good luck.

Bottom of 16 is document number 22420-T1 in the 39th Ward. Ordinance referred, 41724. Common address is 4801 West Peterson Avenue, 5950 North Caldwell Avenue.

Change request is B33, Community Shopping District, to B35, Community Shopping District. We have, oh, the team from TAP. Brayden Lord, who's our lead?

[Speaker 12] (4:17:15 - 4:17:57)
Senators and chairs of the cabinet, all right. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Brayden Lord.

I'm an associate with the law firm of TAP, Stettinius, and Hollister, LLP. And I, along with my colleagues, Graham Grady and Sylvia Mikes, represent the applicant and property owner for this matter, Claremont Enterprises, Inc. Mr. Chairman, as a preliminary matter, we submitted a substitute type one narrative and substitute plans to staff in advance of today's meeting. And we request that the committee adopt the substitute narrative and plans.

[Speaker 1] (4:17:57 - 4:18:07)
Although a medallion was to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type one application, all in favor say aye. Aye. All opposed say nay.

Making sure the ayes have it. Substitute narrative and plans are accepted.

[Speaker 12] (4:18:08 - 4:22:34)
Thank you. I'm joined today by three members of the development team. Carlos Perez, who is the director of development for the applicant.

Tim Bennett, who is the project architect and principal of Timothy Bennett Architects PC. And George Kissel, who is our project land use planner and the president of Akron Kissel Associates. The applicant is requesting a type one zoning map amendment with variations for the subject property located at 4801 West Peterson Avenue and 5550 North Caldwell Avenue from the B3-3 Community Shopping District to the B3-5 Community Shopping District to allow the construction of a ground floor addition to the existing office building at the property, which will measure approximately 17 feet, eight inches in height and contain approximately 8,200 square feet of commercial space, along with improvements to the existing parking lot and building entrance area, which will contain 151 automobile parking spaces and five bicycle parking spaces. The subject property is an irregular kite shaped site bounded by West Peterson Avenue to the north, North Cicero Avenue to the east, Caldwell Avenue and the Cook County Forest Preserve to the south and the Eden's Expressway to the west. The property contains approximately 71,087 square feet of site area and is improved with an existing surface parking lot and a six story office building that includes open air ground floor parking below.

The change request to the B3-5 District is necessary to permit the construction of the proposed addition and the increase in landscaping in the existing parking area and adjacent parkways. The proposed addition will partially replace the open air surface parking lot beneath the office building, providing a modest addition of commercial and retail space that is consistent with the mixed use character of the surrounding area. As authorized by the recently modified type one zoning map amendment procedures, the applicant is seeking landscape variations to allow alternative landscaping treatments, including variations to reduce the required number of parkway trees from 37 to 12, to grant variations for hardship waivers from the ornamental fencing and landscape setback requirements along Caldwell Avenue, to reduce the required perimeter screening along North Cicero Avenue from seven feet to five and a half feet, to reduce the required interior landscaping from 4,075 square feet to 1,769 square feet, to reduce the required number of interior trees from 32 to eight, to reduce the number of interior landscape islands with trees for every 15 parking stalls, and to waive the minimum area, minimum dimension and tree requirements for interior landscaped islands. The applicant will provide a substantial additional and alternative landscaping in the form of an extra wide landscape buffer along Cicero Avenue with a continuous hedge and 13 new trees. That buffer will measure between 10.8 feet and eight feet wide. And across the project as a whole, the applicant will provide 40 new trees and approximately 6,447 square feet of new landscaped area. The landscape relief is necessary due to first, the atypical shape and dimensions of the property, including its irregular kite shape, the substandard width of its west side and its narrow southeast corner. And second, the limiting adjacent conditions affecting the property, including a budding public rights of way on three sides with relatively narrow or non-existent public sidewalks.

Without the requested variations, the applicant could not develop new retail units with sufficient interior space to attract tenants nor provide enough onsite parking to support the building's retail and office users. The applicant met with and presented its plans to Alderman Nugent's team, the Sauganash Community Association and numerous neighbors. In addition, Alderman Nugent hosted a virtual meeting with residents and the applicant about the project on August 26th, 2024, at which the applicant addressed all questions and comments from attending neighbors.

The applicant received several letters of support from neighboring residents and letters of non-objection from the Alderman and Sauganash Community Association, which were forwarded to the committee in advance of this hearing. Now, Carlos, at this time, I invite you to provide a brief statement in support of the application.

[Speaker 54] (4:22:36 - 4:23:38)
Thank you, Brayden. Before I begin, I would like to personally thank Alderman Nugent, her office, and the city's zoning and landscaping staff for their help and guidance throughout the application process. As for a little background, Imperial Realty Company is a family-owned business, which have owned, managed, developed, and most importantly, improved property in the city and the neighborhood of Sauganash for more than 60 years.

I'd like to add I'm also a resident of the beautiful community of Sauganash. Which is something that I'm very proud of. The site is directly across the street from our offices, so it's very near and dear to us and the community.

We're excited to enclose the first floor open air parking in order to establish a new retail frontage along Peterson and Cicero Avenue. In addition, the new landscaping along these streets and in the parking lot will serve as a great enhancement to the community. Thank you in advance for your support and consideration.

[Speaker 12] (4:23:39 - 4:23:48)
And thank you, Carlos, as well as thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. We respectfully request your favorable recommendation and our team is available to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (4:23:49 - 4:24:42)
Thank you. Any questions from committee members? Seeing none, all the forensic moves do pass with the substitute narrative and plans.

All in favor, say aye. Aye. Opposed, say nay.

Hearing the committee chair, the ayes have it. The substitute narrative plans is passed. Thank you, Paul.

We're at the top of page 17. Document number is 22475 in the 20th Ward. Ordinance referred 61224.

Common address is 345 through 79 East 60th Street, 6000 through 6050 South Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive and 6001 through 6049 South Calumet Avenue. Change request is an RM5 residential multi-unit district to institutional plan development with underlying community B31 district. We have attorney, Sylvia Micas.

[Speaker 14] (4:24:46 - 4:25:19)
Good afternoon, Chairman Lawson and members of the committee. My name is Sylvia Micas. I'm an attorney with a law firm of Taft, Stettinius and Hollister.

I, along with my co-counsel, Graham Grady and Braden Lord, represent the applicant Sunshine Community Development Corporation and Sunshine Gospel Ministries. At this time, I request that the record of the plan commission dated on August 15th, 2024, that that hearing be entered into the record of this committee.

[Speaker 1] (4:25:19 - 4:25:29)
Alderman Dowell makes the motion to incorporate all records and findings from that hearing. All in favor, say aye. Aye.

All opposed, say nay. To ensure the ayes have it, the records are incorporated.

[Speaker 14] (4:25:30 - 4:29:59)
Also present with me today are Kimberly Sally, treasurer of Sunshine Community Development Corporation and executive director of Sunshine Gospel Ministries. Our project architect, Monica Chatta with Civic Projects Architecture. And also Kim Morris with, back here, with Chicago Neighborhood Initiatives.

First, we would like to thank and acknowledge Alderwoman Jeanette Taylor, Tyra Owens and the 20th Ward staff for their guidance and assistance throughout this process. We'd also like to thank the staff of the Department of Planning and Development as well as the staff of CDOT and other agencies have all contributed to this project. The subject property, which is owned by the city of Chicago, consists of a net site area of 180,352 square feet and is currently vacant and unimproved.

It is bounded by South Dr. Martin Luther King Drive on the east, South Calumet Avenue on the west, East 60th Street on the north and East 61st Street on the south. The subject property is currently zoned within an RM-5 residential multi-unit district. Sunshine Community Development Corporation plans to acquire and develop the vacant city-owned property with the proposed Sunshine Community Center.

Sunshine Community Development Corporation will operate the community center in tandem with Sunshine Gospel Ministries programming curriculum. The Sunshine Community Center campus will include a new three-story building containing 77,050 square feet, which will operate as the community center. And as you can see, the main entrance to the community center is located on South Dr. Martin Luther King Drive. The proposed community center will include a fitness center, gymnasium, cafe, meeting rooms and pop-up retail on the first floor, programming rooms for media and technology, youth lounge, gym viewing deck on the second floor and administrative offices and office rental space for future tenancy on the third floor. The campus will also include outdoor multi-purpose athletic facilities consisting of 20,000 square feet and a total of 90 on-site parking spaces. So can you advance to slide six?

It's the right-of-way adjustment plan. If not, okay. The campus will also include a 16 to 25 foot wide north-south public alley, which actually is being vacated in order to maintain a private interior access drive for safe and secure pedestrian travel within the community center site.

I also would like to point out that at this time, it's important to note the significant community outreach that Kimberly Sally and her team have conducted over the last few years. Such efforts include outreach to area residents, community pastors and groups, including but not limited to the Washington Park Chamber of Commerce, Washington Park Fieldhouse, Washington Park District Advisory Council and also the deans and administrators of Dyett High School and Washington CICS. This resulted in securing letters of support from the Southeast Chicago Commission, Grand Crossing Park District and Woodlawn Chamber of Commerce.

Furthermore, completion of Alderwoman Jeanette Taylor's economic development team process and a majority vote in favor of a Sunshine Community Center development was secured on December 22nd, 2023. I will now turn the presentation over to Kimberly Sally, who will give a brief overview of the demographically comprehensive programming, community and economic benefits Sunshine Community Center will provide. Thank you so much for your time.

This is a dream deferred for Sunshine Gospel Ministries.

[Speaker 19] (4:29:59 - 4:33:31)
We've been around 419 years. We've served in under-resourced communities. We started off on the near north side in the Cabrini-Green area.

And when public housing shut down, we moved into the Woodlawn area. We've been there about 20 years. Part of our legacy is having a place-based approach.

So we spend a lot of time in community hearing from residents about what the needs are. In 2014, they asked us for a community center. We did a feasibility study and things did not align.

Three years ago, we had a conversation with then State Rep Lamont Robinson, now Alderman Robinson, who mentioned to us that there was a line item in the state budget for a community center. So again, we started our feasibility study. We had started having conversations with Alderman Jeanette Taylor and her team.

She recommended sites that we look at. We looked at five and we did a SWOT analysis and we landed on the southwest corner of 60th and King Drive. And so this center will be demographically comprehensive.

And this has come from hearing from the community. All of the programming that will happen, some of it we do now, and a vast majority of it will be scaling up into this new facility where we'll be able to meet the needs of seniors, which is a missing demographic in our community. We currently, we don't have a heating center or cooling center for our seniors.

Right now, CTA buses come out in the summer to provide cooling opportunities for seniors. So we look at our first floor. We considered our health and wellness floor and recreation.

We're excited. There are sister organizations, Sunshine Enterprises, Trains and Equips Entrepreneurs. And so these multipurpose spaces on the first floor will provide pop-up retail for them.

So they can test out their goods and services without having to have a brick and mortar. On the second floor is where we do a lot of training of them during the day. And then in the evening, we'll continue our afterschool programming.

We have a violence intervention program, housing equity initiative that we run. And then we also do some familyhood programming where we train and support parents and provide curriculum for them, family field trips and things like that. And so we're very much looking forward to the opportunity for this community center to speak into the needs of the community.

In our community, there's some things that are not there for young people to do. There are three schools within walking distance of where we currently are. And it accounts for about 1400 young people.

And so right now we serve about 200 families a year and we serve about 125 youth weekly. And so this is a really great need for our community to provide arts as well as the visual and graphics, recording studio, et cetera. I can go on and on.

The community also spoke and said, why can't we have some of the things we used to have? The gym will be able to be used as a skating rink as well as other multipurpose functions. The community said, we want a restaurant in our own community.

We don't wanna have to go to Hyde Park. And so it will be anchored by a cafe. The center will also be economically impactful in our community as it relates to providing about 150 full-time temporary jobs to the tune of about $3.7 million in income tax revenue along with providing more job opportunities will pretty much double our staff as well as the retail taxes that'll come from the cafe and the pop-ups that we'll have as well. And so we're excited about this. Like I said, it is a dream deferred and we're happy to be at this point in the process and we thank you for your time.

[Speaker 14] (4:33:31 - 4:33:57)
Thank you, Kimberly. In order to proceed forward with this exciting project, the applicant is seeking a zoning change from the existing RM5 district to an institutional plan development with an underlying B3-1 district. We have a letter of support from Alderwoman Taylor that we submitted to the committee and we respectfully request your favorable recommendation in favor of this project and are available for questions.

[Speaker 1] (4:33:58 - 4:34:25)
Thank you very much. We do have a letter of support from Alderwoman Taylor. I appreciate your enthusiasm at the end of a very long meeting.

We're not quite there yet. It does not go unnoticed. And so when you said demographically diverse, you meant it.

You're doing a little bit of everything here for all the people that call the area home. And so the only question maybe I have is, has the city committed any resources or financing for any of the work that's happening there?

[Speaker 19] (4:34:26 - 4:34:38)
We are waiting to hear. So we do have, well, we have a line item from Senator Mattie Hunter and then we're waiting to see if we get the universal financing grant, the economic development grant.

[Speaker 1] (4:34:38 - 4:34:53)
Well, best of luck with that. Any other questions from committee members? Seeing none, Alderman Ramirez-Rosa moves do pass.

All in favor say aye. Aye. All opposed say nay.

Making sure the ayes have it. Item is passed. Best of luck to you.

[Speaker 19] (4:34:53 - 4:34:54)
Thank you so much.

[Speaker 1] (4:34:55 - 4:35:33)
Thank you. Thank you. All right.

Bottom of 17 is document number 22375 in the 34th ward. Ordinance referred 32024. Common address is 1000 through 1024 West Jackson Boulevard, 230 to 238 South Morgan Street and 1015 to 1027 West Adams Street.

Change request is residential business plan development 1562 and DS-3 downtown service district to DX5 downtown mixed use district. Then to residential business plan development 1562 as amended. We have attorney Michael Ezgar.

[Speaker 22] (4:35:34 - 4:35:55)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. Michael Ezgar from the law firm of Acosta-Ezgar on behalf of the applicant, 1016 West Jackson LLC. And preliminarily this matter was considered and approved at the July 18th planned commission hearing.

And I would respectfully request that that record be incorporated into these proceedings.

[Speaker 1] (4:35:55 - 4:36:05)
Yes, Alderman Fuentes makes the motion to incorporate all records and findings from that hearing today. All in favor say aye. Aye.

All opposed say nay. Making sure the ayes have it. The records are incorporated.

[Speaker 22] (4:36:05 - 4:36:16)
Thank you very much. Additionally, there was a minor scrivener's error in the ordinance and so we did introduce a substitute ordinance that I wanted to make sure was also included in today's.

[Speaker 1] (4:36:17 - 4:36:21)
So that is incorporated when we incorporate the records from planned commission? Yeah, great, thank you, perfect.

[Speaker 22] (4:36:22 - 4:37:38)
This is an amendment. Last year was approved, PD 1562 with a 290 foot tall high rise with 370 units. The purpose of the amendment to the PD was to increase the boundary area and include a grocer on the ground floor.

As a result there were 10 additional units added and there were also reduction in height down to 275 feet with 76 affordable units on the property included in the project. We worked closely with the 34th Ward zoning process and went through that process and have a support letter from the West Central Association. This image here was the final efforts with the Alderman's office to confirm the transparency of the retail storefront and a glass for the store and the applicant was committed to making sure that we did that in a transparent way, the glass and activation of the street front.

I wanna thank the Alderman's office and I think Steve Valenziano is here.

[Speaker 1] (4:37:39 - 4:37:46)
If there's any questions, we're available. Thank you, Mr. Esger. Mr. Valenziano from the 34th Ward.

[Speaker 25] (4:37:47 - 4:38:29)
Steve Valenziano, development coordinator for Alderman Conway. Like Michael said, this was previously approved just before the change in ward boundaries in March of 2023. The Alderman supports the application, thinks that there's some big improvements.

The height of the building came down. The addition of a midsize grocer here is really needed and also in expanding the site area and including that grocer, they've now more than doubled the rooftop amenity space. So there's a need for outdoor recreation space in our ward.

So this is, the Alderman does support this application.

[Speaker 1] (4:38:30 - 4:39:18)
Great, sounds like a good plan. Any questions by committee members? Seeing none, Alderman Ramirez-Rosa moves to pass.

All in favor, say aye. Aye. Opposed, nay.

Committee chair, the ayes have it and it's passed as revised. Thank you. Thank you.

Got a couple more here. Top of 18 is document number 22401 in the 27th Ward. Ordinance referred 41724.

Common address is 1132 through 1140 West Randolph, 146 through 82 North May Street, 1133 through 57 West Lake Street and 169 through 83 North Racine Avenue. Change request is residential business plan development 1512 to residential business plan development 1512. Michael Ezger is the attorney.

Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 22] (4:39:19 - 4:39:48)
Michael Ezger for the record from the law firm of Acosta-Ezger on behalf of the applicant Fulton Grounds owner, LLC. This was previously approved and you can see in the image up on the screen, there's actually PD 1512 to be amended is on the left or north side of that image. And I will address that in the following in the next hearing in the next matter.

You wanna hear them together or separate?

[Speaker 1] (4:39:48 - 4:40:15)
Whatever you. I'll go ahead and read in the interest of time. We'll hear them both together.

The second is document number 22400 in the 27th Ward. Ordinance referred 41724. Common address is 201 through 09 North Racine Avenue, 1132 to 56 West Lake Street, 2000 through 08 North May Street.

Change request residential business plan development 1512 to residential business plan development 1512 as amended. Continue.

[Speaker 22] (4:40:15 - 4:41:23)
Excellent, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. So on the left or north side of the image we're looking at here is PD 1512, which was a technical amendment to reduce the boundary area to exclude the area to the south, which is a new PD site. So for what we're calling 201 Racine, which is the area to the left, that PD amendment is strictly to reduce the boundary area.

There is no other changes to the previously approved on that matter. On the new matter, we have amended the PD to include 667 apartment units. And you can see here the architecture and also to incorporate a ground floor commercial user that will be also a grocer.

And there will be in this project, the new project, 133 affordable units on site. We went through the 27th Ward community review process and have a letter of support from the West Central Association as well. I know that Alderman Burnett is not here with us, but I believe he's got a letter of support in with the committee.

[Speaker 1] (4:41:24 - 4:42:24)
We do have a letter of support from Vice Mayor Burnett. Any questions from committee members? Seeing none, all the appointed moves do pass.

All in favor say aye. Aye. I'm sorry.

All the appointed moves do pass for items number 22401 and 22400. All in favor say aye. Aye.

Opposed say nay. I'm sure the ayes have it. Both items pass.

Thank you very much. Thanks everyone. All right.

You guys don't hang out a lot, do you? Top of page 19. Document number 22530-T1 of the 27th Ward.

Ordinance referred 71724. Common address is 341 through 355 North Kenzie Avenue, 3148 through 58 West Carroll Avenue. Change request is V32, Community Shopping District, and M12, Limited Manufacturing Business Park District to C22, Motor Vehicle Related Commercial District.

We have Attorney Rolando Acosta.

[Speaker 17] (4:42:25 - 4:43:29)
Good afternoon. Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant. For the record, I'm taller than Michael.

This matter before you is to change the zoning. The property is currently used as an art gallery, an artist work and sales space, and a venue space. The applicant is purchasing an additional property to the north, south of the train tracks from the city of Chicago, which is to expand the use into that area.

Because the proposed use doesn't fit in the current zoning and the property has split zoning, as well as a need to allow for outdoor use, because part of the art gallery will be expanded and the venue space into the outdoors. This has stated this rezoning. We've gone through a community review process.

This has been a welcome addition to the community. I believe we are also, as part of the type one rezoning, seeking a reduction in the required parking from 38 parking spaces to eight spaces, which are the amount that fit on site. And I believe you have a letter of support from Alderman Burnett on the record.

[Speaker 1] (4:43:30 - 4:44:27)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Burnett. Any questions by committee members? Seeing none, Alderman Ramirez-Rosa moves to pass.

All in favor say aye. Aye. All opposed say nay.

Make sure the ayes have it. The item is passed. Thank you.

All right. One final item on the agenda for the day. This is our first downtown cannabis business establishment application being heard in committee, as opposed to ZBA.

So bear with me, make sure I'm saying everything correctly if needed. I understand that the applicant has met all the criteria previously determined by the department and state municipal law. Document number is 22518-T1 in the 28th ward.

Ordinance referred, 7-17-21. I'm sorry, 24. Common address is 622 to 624 West Roosevelt Road.

Change request is a DS3 downtown service district to DS3 downtown service district. We have again, Attorney Rolando Acosta.

[Speaker 17] (4:44:27 - 4:46:37)
Once again, Mr. Chairman, Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant. Here with me is Misha Joy Pike, dressed in the white coat. She is a representative of the applicant and Chris Atkinson, who is a consultant on the project who has experience in the operation of dispensaries.

This proposal before you involves an existing building. You can see on the map that's located in a commercial area. Roosevelt Road to its south.

To its north is an alley. Across that alley is a large Binney's. To the west is basically the Dan Ryan Expressway.

It is a transit-served location based on the Roosevelt Road bus line. The property was previously the subject of a special use that was approved by the Zoning Board of Appeals for a cannabis dispensary on the ground floor, an identical location to that which is proposed today. Because the use was not established within a year, that special use expired.

We have to reestablish the proposed use, and currently under the new amendment to the zoning ordinance, it requires a type one rezoning. That is why we are here before you today. We held the required community meeting, and nobody attended.

Nobody attended before, so we've now had two with no attendance, mainly because this is a strictly commercial area, and it's using an existing building. The dispensary would operate every day of the week from 10 to 8 p.m., with the exception of Sunday when it would be from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. It would meet all of the state requirements in terms of safety, and having all the doors be alarmed and locked. There'll be on-site security during the hours of operation.

They will be scheduling and overseeing the delivery of product through the back of the property where there is a loading dock that services the building. The dispensary would be located on the ground floor of this building and in the basement of the building. With that, we are happy to answer any questions.

We have talked to Alderman Irvin, as we did once before, and I believe he has indicated his support to the committee.

[Speaker 1] (4:46:38 - 4:46:55)
Yes, we do have the support from Alderman Irvin. I want to maybe just make a point of this one-year rule. I think a lot of us who have had dispensaries have had to make big changes because of the one-year rule.

So if you would write a letter that we could sign on to for our friends in Springfield, that would be helpful.

[Speaker 17] (4:46:55 - 4:47:01)
Well, the one-year rule that I was referring to is actually the Special Use Life. It's a city of Chicago rule.

[Speaker 1] (4:47:01 - 4:47:04)
But then the state also has, you have to establish within.

[Speaker 17] (4:47:04 - 4:47:20)
The state of Illinois, when it issued the dispensary licenses, has deadlines on them, and some of them expired. The first batch of licenses expired, actually, I believe, mid-July, July 17th, and I believe all you were writing the letters for was for an extension of that to the state of Illinois.

[Speaker 1] (4:47:21 - 4:47:28)
It's very hard to do. If you have any kind of build-out or to build new, certainly, to do something in a year is very hard to do.

[Speaker 17] (4:47:28 - 4:47:40)
Particularly, so from the state perspective, if you get the conditional license, you do have to find a location, get your financing together, get the construction documents. To do that in one year is virtually impossible.

[Speaker 1] (4:47:40 - 4:48:53)
And you have to spend some money on property. Right. You know, a lot of things fall through.

You've got to, and not every piece of property works, either, so I think flexibility is gonna be key, which is what we're starting with here, I guess, in this hearing. Do you have any questions by other committee members on this new downtown cannabis application? Seeing none, all the person plaintiff's moves do pass.

All in favor, say aye. Aye. Any opposed, say nay.

The chair, the ayes have it. Item passed. Thank you.

Best of luck to you. Best of luck. There being no further business before the, oh, I'm sorry.

One last call. We've got one item here in the 47th Ward. The attorney was Corinne O'Hara.

I don't think anyone has been added to the room in the last hour. So that's document number 22528-21 in the 47th Ward. Common address is 3710, 3714 North Ashland Avenue that Alder Ramirez Rosa makes a motion to defer.

All in favor, say aye. Aye. Opposed, nay.

Ayes have it. There being no further business before the body, all the person plaintiff's moves to adjourn. All in favor, say aye.

Aye. Any opposed? Oh, the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it.

[Speaker 40] (4:48:54 - 4:48:55)
We are adjourned.
