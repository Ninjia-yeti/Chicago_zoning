We have four speakers, including one online. So we will hear from them now. First up, Bill Salmon.

Salmon?

[Speaker 33] (31:39 - 31:42)
I'm not going to be first here, but I'm going to...

[Speaker 34] (31:42 - 31:44)
It's your day. You may proceed.

[Speaker 33] (31:44 - 31:54)
Okay, I'm here regarding 2903 West Irving Park. I'm the owner there of the building with my partner here.

[Speaker 1] (31:55 - 31:59)
Sir, could you speak more directly into the mic? Okay. I'm sorry about that.

[Speaker 9] (32:00 - 34:27)
So I'm here regarding the proposed building next door to me at 2907 West Irving. I built a building next door there 15 years ago. I've done some developing, and I love the area over there.

It's beautiful. And within the 15 years, I've seen a lot of development go on. Across the street, there's a couple of 26-unit buildings that are all conforming with the neighborhood, and it's very nice.

And next door to me, they want to build this monstrosity, a seven-story building with little to no parking, and I feel it's going to affect the community tremendously with no parking and the height of the building. It's just not going to fit into the area. And I would strongly ask the builder and the developer to build a structure more conforming with the neighborhood because, first of all, I have a sunroof up on top, too.

It's going to take half my sunlight, but it's going to affect the businesses because there's no parking for anybody over there. And with 16 units, it's nothing. And my other concern is the management of the property.

I'm aware that the builder built a building at 5150 Northwest Highway, and it's a huge building over there, and the police were called there 90-something times within a year. So I feel that the management skills aren't there, and if they're going to make a monstrosity like this, it's just going to be harder for them to handle as well. So with that being said, I hope you take everything in insight.

I worked hard over here at this property that I built, and I did it in 08. I've been there 15 years. I've struggled to make the mortgage payments and the taxes, and if I have problems over there, I don't want to cause any danger on myself or my tenants with lack of management.

And it's just a big monstrosity. They're proposing a seven-story building, and there's nothing like that over there. It's a nice community, a lot of homes.

I just don't think it would be the right fit for the community. Okay, thank you for your time.

[Speaker 1] (34:27 - 34:35)
Thank you, Mr. Salmon. Are we good on the clock? Oh, it is.

Great. Next up, we have George Blakemore.

[Speaker 8] (34:38 - 35:17)
You just got through reading some rules. I want a copy of those rules. I want to know when did it go to the Rules Committee, how many voted on it, and when did City Council vote on it.

And where's Salif? He's here. I thought he was the chairman.

It's still corruption here. If he's the chairman, why are you sitting up there? Maybe he's not the chairman anymore.

Maybe he did something that was not proper. You talk about the public speaker's behavior.

[Speaker 32] (35:17 - 35:19)
George Blakemore.

[Speaker 8] (35:24 - 37:28)
In such a manner, a man of my high character. Your behavior is terrible. Anything can be rezoned here if you pay the place.

That gentleman was talking about a seven-story building so tall and the character. It doesn't fit in. But all you have to do, sir, is pay the place.

Pay one of these Altamonts. Pay the place. This is a notorious committee, the zoning that Salif had.

So listen here. The behavior. If we have anything proper, a language used, you are in trouble.

That man is supposed to be the chairman. Why are you not sitting there? Because of bullying.

Bullying one of the Altamont ladies. So you don't show me those rules. You don't have no rules.

And again, if I want to speak, I want to silence Mr. Blakemore. Silence night. Silence is betrayal.

You wanted to silence me. Holy night. Oh, Lord, nothing.

All of you. I'm not the one. Maybe you might bully these other citizens, but you don't bully me.

Show me the rules. When did you vote on this? When did it go to the committee, the rules committee?

You have no rules. And Chicago is known to be one of the most, the most corrupt cities in the United States of America. Because of people like you, you, and all of you.

[Speaker 32] (37:28 - 37:39)
You talk in your room, and you say what you want to say. So those words don't sound good to me. And I want to speak.

Don't let those people bully you.

[Speaker 1] (37:41 - 37:56)
Thank you, Mr. Blakemore. For the record, I wanted to add to the quorum Alderman Siccio-Lopez, Alderman Hopkins, and Alderman David Moore. Next speaker is Sean O'Neill.

[Speaker 17] (37:59 - 38:03)
I'm here to host the Full Circle Development Building.

[Speaker 1] (38:03 - 38:06)
Could you speak, Mr. O'Neill, more into the mic? Thanks.

[Speaker 17] (38:06 - 39:26)
I'm here to oppose the development at Full Circle. It's a plan to build at 2907 Irving. I believe that the seven-story building is not in the character of the neighborhood, which is mostly single-family homes.

There's nothing within miles of here that is anywhere near this tall. Sixteen parking spaces are way too few. The older woman will lead you to believe that there's plenty of parking around there when if you ask anybody that lives in the area or any of the businesses, they totally disagree.

This has been pushed through with no community input. They've been working on this for several years, and very secretively. She held no community meetings.

There was a Zoom meeting, which was hand-picked with her people on there. She says there's plenty of support for this, but there's not. We have petitions that everybody should have with over 300 neighbors that are in opposition to this, and we're going to have plenty more.

So, that's about it. It's been pushed through, and she shouldn't be doing the zoning on behalf of the developer. They should be doing their own zoning change.

That's how it's always been done before. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (39:26 - 39:47)
Thank you, Mr. O'Neill. We did receive comments that were forwarded to all of the committee members. Thank you.

Our final speaker is on the Zoom, Ian McCollum. Mr. McCollum, we're good to go? Hello, can you hear me?

Yes, please proceed.

[Speaker 7] (39:48 - 42:51)
Okay, thank you. My name is Ian McCollum. I'm a resident of the 33rd Ward.

I live in Albany Park, just north of the proposed 2907 West Irving Park zoning change. I'd like to quickly address previous comments about 911 calls to 5150 Northwest Highway. That's a disability, elderly, and veterans community with 75 units.

I think we can imagine a lot of reasons that you might need to call emergency services there, many of which are not a danger to the community. So, that aside, I want to speak today in terms of choices. We have a choice between keeping the northwest side affordable for all kinds of people or allowing a cycle of gentrification to continue.

The 33rd Ward has historically been a place with mixed housing and diverse population and we've recently seen a precipitous decline in our multi-family housing as two to four unit buildings are deconverted into single family dwellings. This drives down the housing supply and drives up the cost of living, pushing families out and sometimes with nowhere to go but to their cars. It atomizes our communities and depopulates our dense and rich neighborhoods leading to a community where people don't have the same rich day-to-day chance encounters that they would in a more dense neighborhood.

This proposal's 45 units alone are not going to replace the housing density that we've lost but it is an essential step in reversing course. Critics of the zoning change often speak about changing the character of Irving Park. They say that we have to moderate our demands for high quality affordable housing by shrinking the size but no one asked us when they deconverted our beautiful and dense neighborhood into rows and rows of single family housing.

Single family zoning is just considered the default. Down the street from me, a large church burned down and was replaced by three single family homes themselves the size of two to three flat buildings but they're not going to be used that way. Meanwhile, we have to beg, plead, and go through an onerous process to approve one affordable development at a time.

These are the choices that I'm talking about. The critics' concerns have been heard. Despite what a previous commenter said, the Alderwoman had an extensive community-driven zoning process and fielded comments in multiple formats.

Groups of neighbors on both sides debated and they brought their organizations to have their voices heard. I was at the meeting that person referenced. There were plenty of people speaking against the zoning.

That said, the process revealed an overwhelming amount of support for the proposed development. It has the support because developers have considered the needs of the neighborhood by designing a building with setbacks on the top and bottom floors giving us ample space to walk and clearing some of the skyline so that you can see the sky so that you have your light so that it feels less intrusive. It's also a transit-oriented development with on-site parking.

What a lot of people don't acknowledge is that many people who live in these units are not going to have a car. They will need public transit. It's going to join a community of great developments like the Oso Apartments on Montrose and the Maria Elena Cifuentes building currently in development on Lawrence that make Albany Park an affordable, dense, and safe place to live.

Please, I'm asking you all to affirm the choice that the 33rd Ward has already made.

[Speaker 1] (42:52 - 42:56)
Thank you, Mr. McCollum. We do have one more speaker. John Friedman.

[Speaker 10] (42:59 - 45:26)
Good morning. I'm here representing the Hornet Park Neighbors, which is a community organization just north of the 2909 development in Irving Park in question. Without getting into the merits of the project, I think that I would like that the Council not approve the application as written because of clerical errors in it.

The application, and we're talking about A8852, talks about the purpose of the application is to restore or correct a down zone that had been made to bring it in compliance and make it relative to the other buildings in the area. But the B3-3 zoning that is being requested is a gross up zone from what originally was there. Originally, the building that site was the C1-1, and increasing the zoning to a P3-3 will definitely make it out of character with the neighborhood.

The B3-3 allows a seven-story, 80-foot building. I think it's currently proposed at 79 feet. Previously, the building was a two-story building, and nothing in the area is more than four and a half stories.

So because of the clerical error, I think that the application either should be denied or postponed until the community can weigh in and have a live public meeting regarding this topic. There are four community groups that are opposing this project, ours being one of them. You have some documentation from some of the others regarding it.

We had tried to get a live public meeting for the last six months regarding this project, and it had been denied. There was a Zoom meeting, but as we're all aware, Zoom meetings do not replace live meetings in terms of interaction with the public. They're tightly controlled, they're time-limited.

In some cases, there were some technical difficulties, and some of the speakers opposing the project were not allowed to speak, were not able to speak, rather, I want to be clear. But anyway, I should state that we are not opposed, the community groups are not opposed to an affordable housing project on this site. We all recognize the needs for affordable housing, but a seven-story project there is completely out of character, and we want a good affordable housing project.

I mean, the city landscape is littered with poorly-conceived, poorly-designed affordable housing projects. We don't want this to be another one. Thank you very much for your time.

[Speaker 1] (45:26 - 47:38)
Thank you, sir. That concludes our public comments. We will now move on to large signs over 100 square feet in the area, 24 feet above grade, and we will hear them all together.

I will read the ward, followed by the address, and then take a motion at the end. In the 6th ward, 7601 South State Street. In the 7th ward, 2425 East 71st Street.

In the 12th ward, 3207 South Halstead Street. In the 22nd ward, 3315 West 26th Street. Two signs in the 25th ward at 3045 West 26th Street.

In the 27th ward, 1357 North Elston Avenue. Two signs in the 27th ward located at 800 West Fulton Market. Two signs in the 32nd ward located at 2501 North Damon Avenue.

Two signs in the 42nd ward located at 150 East Ontario. Four signs in the 42nd ward located at 10 East Grand Avenue. Two signs in the 25th ward located at 3936 North Milwaukee.

And lastly, two signs in the 50th ward located at 6374 North Lincoln. In the 12th ward and the 11th ward, 3207 South Halstead Street. In the 12th ward, 3228 South Wood Street.

All right, if no questions by committee members, do I hear a motion due passed by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? All in the middle of the spot, a move is due passed. Any objections?

Hearing none, the orders are passed. We will now move on to the map amendments in an effort to ensure the committee meeting runs smoothly as possible. Items are grouped together according to witness and will be heard in that order rather than ward order.

However, we're going slightly out of order and we're going to start in the middle of page three. In the 33rd ward, item number A8852, ordinance referred 91423, common address 2907 to 23 West Irving Park Road. The change request is RS1, residential single unit detached house district to B33 community shopping district.

I believe, is it Patrick or the other woman?

[Speaker 21] (47:39 - 48:32)
I can definitely start, thank you, Chair. The project that we are talking about is the 100% affordable housing development that I am very proud that we have been working for with Full Circle and with our community. I have a community-driven zoning process that came from my colleague in the 35th ward and we modeled after that community-driven zoning process.

We did have community engagement. This is a seven-story building in Irving Park. I want to allow my zoning and infrastructure director, Rebecca Rios, to talk about the reasoning behind the zoning change and I would love for Patrick to also chime in.

[Speaker 1] (48:33 - 48:38)
Great, thank you, all the women. Ms. Rios, please state your name for the record.

[Speaker 6] (48:38 - 52:52)
Good morning, my name is Rebecca Rios. I'm director of zoning and infrastructure for the 33rd ward. Good morning, Chairperson and members of the committee.

So the property in question, or properties 2907 to 2923 West Irving Park Road were rezoned in 2018. And as you can see from the map, I think even my 8-year-old child can look at that map and tell you which part does not belong, right? And so right directly across the street, 2900, is zone B33.

And so not only did this rezoning impact the now vacant lot, but it also rezoned two properties that include three businesses to RS1 as well. And RS1 is the lowest density residential, which really only allows for single family homes to be built at a time when we're really facing a housing crisis in the city of Chicago. Our office is not certain if these businesses were notified of this at the time, but the 2018 rezoning has had lasting impacts and repercussions on the property owners of those properties as well.

This zoning change not only includes the site for the full circle development, but it also includes those properties as well. And currently the business at 2921 West Irving Park was shut down, citing multiple code violations. Due to the current rezoning of RS1, these property owners are not able to get the needed permits, the necessary permits to actually bring their building up to code.

Future businesses are not able to utilize that space and to apply for business licensing. Chicago business licensing mandates that mostly all businesses have to operate out of a commercial or business district. So however, as for 2907 to 2917, we've heard some comments.

Full Circle Communities and Visionary Ventures did contact our office initially and plan to submit a Type 1 application. They did go through our community-driven zoning process and they also went through years of review from DPD and DOH. So there has been extensive review for this project specifically.

And after this process and our public meeting that was held in August of this year through Zoom, we received 79% support for this project. You know, obviously 100% would be nice in a perfect world, but 79% is a number that we're really proud of. And again, we received feedback in many ways.

So we did take public comments and Sean O'Neill his question was actually accepted and responded to at this public meeting. And so we also received feedback for weeks after this meeting and we have all that. We can share that with you guys through the chair if needed.

After the community meeting, we were in support of this project. However, after consulting with the zoning administrator Patrick Murphy, who can speak to this a little bit, considering the long-term consequences of the businesses and property owners at 2919 and 2921 and 2923, and also the harm that would be caused by only allowing the lowest density single-family homes to be built on such a transit-oriented street like Irving Park Road, the Alderwoman has made the decision to introduce this B33 rezoning ordinance. It will allow full circle communities to create affordable and dignified housing for Native American and low-income families.

It will ensure that property owners at 2919, 2921 and 2923 are able to maintain their properties and receive the permits that are necessary and allow businesses to thrive and take up that space. It will also future-proof the majority of the block by ensuring that any future developments will trigger the 20% affordable requirements ordinance.

[Speaker 1] (52:55 - 52:59)
Thank you, Ms. Rios. Zoning Administrator Patrick Murphy.

[Speaker 16] (53:00 - 54:21)
Hi, Patrick Murphy, the Department of Planning. Everything that's been said both from the Alderman and her staff is correct. When we looked at this portion of the block on Irving Park Road and the aldermanic zoning actions that were taken in 2018 from purely from a zoning district and a land use standpoint, having an RS1 district on Irving Park Road or this portion of Irving Park Road would not be appropriate.

Looking at other city initiatives that we are pursuing as they relate to zoning actions and development throughout the city, the Transit Served Location Ordinance, more commonly known as the Connected Communities Ordinance from a couple of summers ago, promotes as a vehicle to encourage more development and the provision of more affordable housing and the provision of less parking, looking at Dash 3 zoning districts. This portion of Irving Park Road, the land uses that are appropriate for this area, as well as the zoning, the underlying zoning, the base zoning districts that would be more appropriate, all pointed to this zoning district.

That it also is able to unwind a larger zoning action that put in a district that's probably not appropriate for this area for the long term is an added benefit and a reason why this is the recommended course that we gave to the alderman's office as far as how to pursue this zoning.

[Speaker 1] (54:21 - 54:25)
Great, thank you. Questions by committee members? Alder Lispata?

[Speaker 5] (54:28 - 55:52)
Maybe more of a comment because I hear and respect the feedback from the room. I just want to echo what Commissioner Murphy was saying. If you wanted to discourage development, you would have just made it B3-1 when this was down-zoned in 2018 we were saying.

What you do here is when you want to deny any profitable or purposeful use of the land, period. RS-1 for that lot on Irving Park, there's a real absurdity to however that zoning decision was made. And then we were being asked and the question was being asked in the room whether this was a contextual zoning change.

But it is. Not only from what we see on the map here, but you can look it up. I think we have at least three different, four different B3-3 parcels within 400, 500 feet of this change.

So, on its face, I mean, there's questions that I would love to ask offline about the development. But to say also that Full Circle does not do quality affordable housing is a fabrication. They have done great work up and down Milwaukee Avenue.

I'm excited for the project and I'm excited to vote yes on it. Thank you, Chair.

[Speaker 1] (55:53 - 56:01)
Thank you, Alderman LaSpada. I should have mentioned in your packet you have letters of support and opposition. I just mentioned the opposition earlier.

Thank you. Alderman Conway.

[Speaker 30] (56:03 - 56:10)
For Mr. Murphy, is this a transit-oriented district? Okay, that's my only question. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (56:10 - 57:01)
Great. Any other questions? Hearing none, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

All the person Fuentes moves do pass. Any objections? Hearing none, this item is passed.

Congratulations. Good project. All right, we're moving back to the top of page 2.

Item number A8847 in the 2nd Ward. In the 2nd Ward, Ordinance Report 9-14-23 Common Address 1601-1611 North Halstead Street, 744-758 West North Avenue. Change request.

Plan Development 14-16 to B35 Community Shopping District. We have a speaker on this is Noah Sofranek from the Department of Planning and Development.

[Speaker 20] (57:02 - 57:31)
Thank you, Chairman. Yes, this ordinance is in front of you today to unwind a plan development that is not moving forward. Back in 2018, developer entered into an agreement with Yondorf Hall, the adjacent landmark building, to work on development rights for a proposal on the site.

They have since canceled that contract and are not moving forward on it, so the city Department of Planning and Development is moving to enact the sunset clause to restore the B35 zoning designation to allow for a future development proposal on the site.

[Speaker 1] (57:32 - 57:38)
Thank you, Mr. Sofranek. Do we have any questions by committee members? Alderman Villegas.

Thank you.

[Speaker 25] (57:39 - 57:44)
Hey Noah, why did they decide not to move forward with the project?

[Speaker 20] (57:45 - 57:58)
Alderman, I don't have specifics from the applicant. We just know that there is a new applicant engaged seeking to use the site and they would not trigger a plan development as part of their proposal, so under the B35, they would be able to develop as of right.

[Speaker 1] (58:00 - 58:01)
Great. Alderman LaSpada.

[Speaker 5] (58:03 - 58:13)
Noah, this is not the same as the development that moved through Plan Commission a couple weeks ago or a couple months ago, or is it?

[Speaker 20] (58:14 - 58:25)
Alderman, this is not, this is a different, that is a separate development that's just north of the railroad tracks on Halstead. That's a separate plan development that was put in place. Thought so, just was trying to picture it in my head.

[Speaker 5] (58:25 - 58:27)
Thank you, sir. You're welcome. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (58:27 - 59:27)
Any other questions? Hearing none, Alderman LaSpada makes the motion do pass for the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, the item is passed. Next up, item in the ninth ward. We're going to hold that until a little bit later in the meeting, so we'll move to item number A, 8853 in the 21st ward.

Ordinance referred 91423. Common address, 808 to 820 West 87th Street. Change request, a B3 1 Community Shopping District and M11 Limited Manufacturing District to B3 1 Community Shopping District.

Alderperson Fuentes, we have a substitute. Alderperson Fuentes moves to accept the substitute for the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, the substitute is before us. We have Alderman Ronnie Mosley.

[Speaker 27] (59:28 - 1:00:05)
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Chair, this is a action that will unify that shopping district or zoning area. There's one parcel that is a part of an existing building that is out of uniformity as it relates to the B3-1.

It's currently marked as a M1-1, so this is an action that will rectify that and allow for a daycare to open up and continue to service the residents of the 21st ward.

[Speaker 1] (1:00:09 - 1:01:31)
Thank you, Alderman. Any questions by committee members? Hearing none, do I hear a motion due pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

Alderman Espada moves due pass. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Thank you, Alderman Mosley. We're going to skip the next three items in the 24th ward until later in the meeting. We'll move to the top item number middle bottom on page 3 in the 36th ward.

Item number A8841 ordinance referred 71923 common address 934-940 northwestern avenue. Change request an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to B3-2 community shopping district from RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district and B3-2 community shopping district to a B1-1 neighborhood shopping district. We have a substitute on this item as well.

Alderman Fuentes moves to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the substitute is before us.

We have Alderman Villegas.

[Speaker 25] (1:01:33 - 1:01:42)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. This zoning change is to ensure that community input will be obtained prior to development.

[Speaker 1] (1:01:44 - 1:02:17)
Great, thank you. Any questions from committee members? Hearing none, do I hear a motion due pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

Alderman Riley moves due pass. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed as substituted.

Next item, number A8842 also in the 36th ward ordinance referred 71923 common address 812 northwestern avenue. Change request B3-2 community shopping district to B1-1 neighborhood shopping district. Alderman Villegas.

[Speaker 25] (1:02:18 - 1:02:28)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. This ordinance also is similar to the ordinance that we just passed to allow for community input for future development.

[Speaker 1] (1:02:29 - 1:03:23)
Great, thank you. Any questions by members? I have no questions.

Do I hear a motion due pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderman Hopkins moves due pass. Any objections?

Hearing none, this item is passed. All right. Now on to the top of page four.

With the private applications, actually Alderman LaSpada, we're going to have them sit here. We'll displace you. Thank you.

Item number 22281 in the 10th ward ordinance referred 10-423 common address 8301 to 8303 South Shore Drive. Change request is an RS3 residential single unit detached house district and B3-1 community shopping district to B3-1 community shopping district. We have attorney Thomas Moore.

[Speaker 4] (1:03:23 - 1:06:01)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name for the record is Tom Moore and with me today is Janine Valerie Logan and in the audience are members of our board of directors and her colleague Shaquan Depart. This is a big step in a long journey.

Ms. Logan has almost single-handedly gotten through the Illinois legislature the Illinois alternative delivery statute which allows midwives to do out of hospital deliveries in Illinois and she has located this building. It's an old church and she has a fundraise to change it into a delivery facility, a community delivery facility and she got to the closing and found that it's one of those odd situations where the property is a divided lot right down the middle of the building. It's an RS3 and a B3-1.

The purpose of today's motion is to make it a unified B3-1 so that she can move forward with her facility and we had a very well attended community meeting earlier this week in the 10th ward and there really were no objectors. There were only supporters and at that meeting they brought out the horrendous statistics of, for instance, in that area where women of color have a much, much higher death rate than other areas of the city, for instance, and that where you have this alternative, they can greatly decrease the maternal and the infant death rate and so Ms. Logan is a highly qualified multi-credentialed nurse and midwife and we'd ask for your support. We have the support of the 10th ward.

[Speaker 1] (1:06:01 - 1:07:03)
Thank you so much. Questions from committee members? No?

Hearing none, Alderman LaSpada makes the motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, this item is passed.

Congratulations. Best of luck to you. It's amazing work you're doing.

Next up, Oh, I'm sorry. Alderman Clay has requested to attend the meeting by remote means under the provisions of Rule 59. Is there any objection to this request?

Hearing no objection, Alderman Clay is allowed to attend the meeting by remote means. Welcome, Alderman Clay. Middle of page 4, item number 22295 in the 26th ward.

Ordinance referred 11123. Common address is 2739 West Evergreen Avenue. Change request.

An RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district. Once again, Tom Moore.

[Speaker 4] (1:07:05 - 1:07:50)
This is a typical case that happens too often where a couple bought a what they thought was a three-flat. It had a basement apartment. It turns out that the city records only showed it as a two-flat.

This zoning change would remedy that situation and allow them to legalize the basement apartment. The couple, the Sallies, went through a community process with Alderperson Fuentes, who is here. We have a letter of support from the alderman.

We appreciate your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (1:07:51 - 1:07:52)
Great. Thank you. Alderperson Fuentes?

[Speaker 31] (1:07:54 - 1:08:07)
Thank you. I have a committee on zoning that ensures that every applicant that requests a zoning change in my community go through a thorough community process. These residents have, and we are happy to support the additional dwelling unit.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:08:08 - 1:08:11)
Thank you, alderperson. Any questions by committee members? Alderman Espada?

[Speaker 5] (1:08:12 - 1:08:23)
This is a zoning change that we're doing to legalize an existing ADU. This is accurate. A new ADU.

[Speaker 1] (1:08:27 - 1:08:40)
It's legalizing the existing condition. Your question might be, if this were in the ADU pilot zone, would this qualify? I would ask the staff from DPD who are nodding yes.

Correct. Yes.

[Speaker 5] (1:08:41 - 1:09:04)
That's kind of what I was driving at. I respect and honor the year that you've spent doing zoning changes to help your residents legalize their ADUs. I'm just going to hashtag ADU reform.

Let's bring it forward for everyone who's interested. Looking forward to that in 2024. Thank you, Acting Chair.

[Speaker 1] (1:09:04 - 1:09:43)
Thank you for the plug, Alderman Espada. Any other questions? Hearing none, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

Alderperson Fuentes moves to do pass. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Next up, item number 22280 in the 44th Ward. Ordinance referred 10-423. Common address, 1051 West Cornelia Avenue.

The change request is an RT-4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to RM-5, a residential multi-unit district. We have an amendment on this for type 1.

[Speaker 4] (1:09:44 - 1:09:48)
It's a voluntary type 1 at the Alderman's request.

[Speaker 1] (1:09:49 - 1:10:00)
Alderman Conway moves to amend the application to a type 1 application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is amended to a type 1 application.

Mr. Moore.

[Speaker 4] (1:10:00 - 1:10:53)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is a case where it's an existing four-unit condominium building. During COVID, the couple who lives on the top unit and has roof rights and has an existing little addition up on the roof learned that they were both working from home and they continue to do that and they want to build a full room up there so that they can not be in each other's...

They can run their respective businesses separately and not be for better or for worse but not for lunch. We came to you and we notified all the surrounding neighbors and particularly talked to the immediate neighbors and we're aware of no objection and we request your support.

[Speaker 1] (1:10:54 - 1:11:16)
Great. Thank you. Items in the 44th board.

I know we went through a process with the neighbors and obviously we're ready to move forward. Any questions by committee members? Hearing none, Alderman Villegas moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed as amended to a type 1.

[Speaker 4] (1:11:16 - 1:11:17)
Thank you very much. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:11:19 - 1:11:49)
Next, we're on the top of page 5. We're going to skip this one right now. Moving on to the middle of page 5.

Item number 22293 in the 13th ward. Ordinance referred 11123. Common addresses 4619 to 23 West 63rd Street.

Change request. RS2 residential single unit detached house district to B11 neighborhood shopping district. Paul Rickleman is here to present.

[Speaker 26] (1:11:53 - 1:12:38)
Good morning, Chairman Lawson and members of the committee. Thank you. My name is Paul Rickleman for the record.

I'm here with Monsey Chaco, who is the applicant, the owner of Sumo Assets, LLC. The applicant 4619 to 23 West 63rd is currently designated an RS2. We're seeking to amend it to B11.

The property is currently improved with a shopping center type building. Mr. Chaco is going to invest about a million dollars into the building and hopefully lease it up very soon for all sorts of community service items. We did have some robust community engagement with Alderman Quinn and have worked out some details and promises regarding the use of the building going forward.

So with that, we'd like the committee's support.

[Speaker 1] (1:12:39 - 1:13:26)
Great. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Quinn. I don't believe he's here.

Anyone from the 13th Ward to speak on it? Any questions from committee members? Hearing none, Alderman Riley moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, this item is passed. Thank you.

Best of luck to you guys. Okay. Okay.

Next item is number 22287 T1 in the 25th Ward. Ordinance referred to as the 11123 common address is 2156 West 21st Street. Change request is a B23 Neighborhood Mixed Use District to B25 Neighborhood Mixed Use District.

We have Attorney Jimena Castro.

[Speaker 13] (1:13:28 - 1:14:40)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the board. For the record, my name is Jimena Castro. I am a Zoning Attorney at Acosta-Escar and we are here today on behalf of the applicant for the matter before you today.

We're seeking a change in zoning from a B23 to a B25 to correct a clerical error on a previous map amendment that was passed that incorrectly rezoned it to a B23. This is a Type I application and for just a little bit of backstory, the property is approved with a residential building that contains 10 dwelling units and a two-car garage. We're rezoning it to include two additional dwelling units for a total of 12 dwelling units.

We'll be providing one parking space, bicycle parking as well and we'll be seeking ETOD parking reduction following the rezoning and we also engage the community and we're happy to let the board know that the rents provided will be of an affordable range to make sure that people in Pilsen stay in Pilsen. We have Aldermanic support as well.

[Speaker 1] (1:14:40 - 1:14:48)
Great. Thank you, Ms. Castro. We do have the Alderman's support as well.

Are there any questions by committee members? Alderman Espada.

[Speaker 5] (1:14:49 - 1:15:03)
Thank you, Chair. I'm just curious with the move to B2-5, moving from 10 to 12 dwelling units even though it's converting an existing building, does that make it ARO applicable or where does the affordability come from?

[Speaker 13] (1:15:05 - 1:15:30)
Any unit that is rehabilitated that is over $75,000 would be subject to ARO and if it's not, it's not. However, the Alderman is aware of this and we work closely with his community through the community process to make sure through an agreement with the Alderman's office that the rents are kept in an affordable range which we have achieved for this project.

[Speaker 5] (1:15:30 - 1:15:33)
I think that's everything for me. Thank you. Thank you, Chair.

[Speaker 1] (1:15:34 - 1:16:32)
Great. Any other questions? Hearing none, do I hear a motion due passed by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

Alderman Espada moves due passed. Any objections? Hearing none, this item is passed.

Thank you very much. Next up, also in the 25th Ward, item number 22292-T1 Ordinance Referred 11-1-23 Common Address is 1805-11 South Allport Street Change Request C-1-2 Neighborhood Commercial District and RT-4 Residential Two-Flat Townhouse and Multi-Unit District to C-1-3 Commercial Neighborhood District We have a substitute for this. Alderperson Fuentes moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the Type 1 application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, the substitute narrative and plans are accepted. We have Bridget O'Keefe on behalf of the applicant.

[Speaker 15] (1:16:33 - 1:18:01)
Good morning. My name is Bridget O'Keefe. I am an attorney with Daspen & Almond.

My address is 300 South Wicker Drive, Suite 2200 Chicago 60606 The applicant in this case is 1215-25 West 18th Street, Chicago LLC They are seeking approval of a Type 1 rezoning to change the underlying zoning of the property located at 1805-11 South Allport which is the southeast corner of Allport and 18th Street in the 25th Ward. The existing zoning for the landmark building is split between a C-1-2 district and an R-T-4 district We're proposing to consolidate the zoning into a C-1-3 designation. The subject property contains a Chicago landmark building commonly known as Thalia Hall.

The building holds an entertainment venue, restaurants, and eight existing residential units. The applicant purchased a vacant lot immediately south of Thalia Hall to build a small two-story addition on the vacant lot which will provide an additional elevator and storage for Thalia Hall and an outdoor seating area to serve the existing restaurant. There will be no changes to the existing use of Thalia Hall or the other uses within the building.

We have met twice with the 25th Ward Zoning Advisory Board and we have Aldermanic support of the project. We respectfully request the committee's approval of the Type 1 rezoning application and thank you for your consideration.

[Speaker 1] (1:18:01 - 1:18:23)
Thank you. We do have the Alderman's support. Do I have any questions by committee members?

Hearing none, do I hear a motion to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderman Fuentes moves to do pass. Any objections?

Hearing none, this item is passed with the substitute narrative and plans.

[Speaker 15] (1:18:24 - 1:18:25)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (1:18:25 - 1:18:49)
Thank you. Middle of page 6. Item number 22285-T1 in the 27th Ward.

Ordinance referred 11-1-23. Common address is 159-67 North Racine Avenue. Change request.

C-12 Neighborhood Commercial District to DX-5 Downtown Mixed-Use District. We have Timothy Barton to present.

[Speaker 11] (1:18:50 - 1:20:46)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My name is Tim Barton. I'm with the firm of Thomas R.

Raines, Attorney at Law, LLC. And I'm here today on behalf of 167 Racine, LLC, which is both the applicant and the property owner. This site is a 100 by 116 foot parcel improved with a four and a half story masonry commercial building which is approximately 100 years old.

Not surprisingly, the building of that age is built lot line to lot line, especially on such a small lot, so there are no parking spaces available on the site. The site, however, is within 1,300 feet of the CTA Morgan Street Green Line Station and is therefore a transit served location. The applicant is seeing the zoning map change in order to build a two-story rooftop addition for eight new dwelling units.

The finished height of the building will be 78 feet, 8 inches. Based on its transit served location, the parking requirement is four auto spaces. However, the applicant will be seeking a variation to reduce that number to zero due to the fact that there is no space on the site for parking.

This will be a Type I amendment and you have plans, narrative and plans in the ordinance. The applicant met with the West Central Association and the neighbors of the West Loop, both of which have supported the proposal. The alderman is also in support of the amendment.

I believe he is here to indicate his support.

[Speaker 1] (1:20:47 - 1:20:50)
Yes, thank you. We have Vice Mayor Burnett.

[Speaker 14] (1:20:50 - 1:21:32)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As the Councilor may have said, we encouraged them to go to our local community organizations, which in this case is several. He went to three different community organizations.

They all gave input. He also had a community meeting with the West Central Association. At that community meeting, everybody was in support of it.

This is going up a couple of stories. This is a small thing compared to what actually happens in our ward. The community supported it with no problem.

They supported it, I supported it. We asked for the committee support. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:21:32 - 1:21:41)
Thank you, Vice Mayor. Eight units, I had to make sure that was 27th Ward. I put a zero on that for you.

Any questions by committee members?

[Speaker 30] (1:21:44 - 1:21:58)
Alderman Conway. Eight units is still a big, it is across the street from the 34th Ward as well. Excellent.

The way you all cut the map, everything is across the street from the 34th Ward.

[Speaker 1] (1:21:59 - 1:22:35)
Any other questions by committee members? Hearing none, do I hear a motion to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderman Laspada moves to pass.

Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed. Thank you.

Next item, 22294T1, also in the 27th Ward. Ordinance referred 11.1.23. Common address is 1235 West Grand Avenue. Change request is M22 Light Industry District to B33 Community Shopping District.

Tyler Manick is here to present.

[Speaker 12] (1:22:37 - 1:24:06)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Tyler Manick of Shane Banks, Kenny and Schwartz. I'm here on behalf of the applicant 1235 West Grand LLC, which is a subsidiary of the Suenos Restaurant Group.

I'm joined by Oscar Sotelo and Steven Sandoval, the principals of the Suenos Restaurant Group and Jordan Winkle, the project architect. We're here seeking a zoning map amendment at 1235 West Grand to operate a general restaurant there. Currently, the location is zoned M22, which prevents a general restaurant use in the size that the Suenos Restaurant Group is looking to operate in.

The proposed restaurant will occupy 6,935 square feet of the existing building. Historically, for nearly 50 years, this building was used for a general restaurant use, but since the last restaurant use went out of business more than a year ago, the applicant has precluded from reestablishing the general restaurant use due to the expiration of a legal nonconforming use status. This zoning map amendment from M22 to a B33 will bring the building in use into a conforming zoning district.

Prior to this meeting, the applicant did meet with Vice Mayor Burnett and engaged in a community meeting hosted by the neighbors of River West. The community meeting resulted in full support, and I believe Vice Mayor Burnett is here to confirm his support too.

[Speaker 34] (1:24:08 - 1:24:09)
Yes.

[Speaker 12] (1:24:10 - 1:24:25)
Based upon that support, I respectfully request this committee's favorable recommendation for the zoning map amendment to rezone 1235 West Grand from an M22 to a B33 zoning district, and we're here to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (1:24:26 - 1:24:26)
Thank you.

[Speaker 14] (1:24:27 - 1:25:05)
Vice Mayor Burnett? Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As the Council said, we did have a community meeting with the neighbors of River West.

Everyone was in full support. This is a no-brainer. Just trying to utilize the space that's already a restaurant allowed them to be able to do the same thing that's been done there for years.

Because of the time lapse, they had to do a zoning change. So we're in full support of it. The only thing everyone was disappointed with was that this restaurant, which has their current restaurant, I think, got an award.

It's just got an award. Was it a Michelin award?

[Speaker 25] (1:25:07 - 1:25:14)
It was a stellar review from the Chicago Tribune. Excellent. Go ahead and state your name just for the record.

Oscar Sotelo.

[Speaker 1] (1:25:14 - 1:25:15)
Congratulations.

[Speaker 14] (1:25:15 - 1:25:39)
I guess that's in Brendan Riley's ward, if I'm not mistaken. And so everyone at the meeting was just a little disappointed that they weren't able to taste the tacos that they produced there. But outside of that, with that, everyone in the community is excited to have them there.

They said the food is fantastic and we're in full support of it as for the committee support.

[Speaker 1] (1:25:40 - 1:26:22)
Thank you, Vice Mayor. I think everyone in this meeting is disappointed there's no tacos. We'll talk about that offline.

Any other questions from committee members? Hearing none, Alderperson Fuentes moves to pass. Any objections?

Hearing none, the item is passed. Thank you. Congratulations.

Best of luck to you. Top of page seven, item number 22288 in the 29th ward. The ordinance is referred on November 1st, 23.

Common address, 1141 North Austin Boulevard. Change request, RS3, residential single unit detached house district to an RT3.5 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district. We have Dean Maragos.

[Speaker 18] (1:26:23 - 1:27:10)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Dean T. Maragos of the law firm of Maragos and Maragos at 1 North LaSalle.

We are representing the applicant Javier Enriquez and as was stated, this matter involves an existing building to be converted from a single-family residence to a two-unit residential building. We've worked very closely with Alderman Taliaferro who has issued a letter of full support. We also have heard no objections from any members of the community and although we've sent out the property owner letters, et cetera.

I have submitted Alderman Taliaferro's letter. If you need a copy, I have an extra one with me and I'll entertain any questions.

[Speaker 1] (1:27:10 - 1:27:17)
Great. Thank you. We do have the letter from Alderman Taliaferro, yes.

Any questions from committee members? Alderman LaSpada?

[Speaker 5] (1:27:19 - 1:27:26)
I'm just curious, are we adding, I'm looking at the building right now, are we adding an attic unit, a basement?

[Speaker 18] (1:27:26 - 1:27:31)
We're going to be adding a unit upstairs, another upper unit.

[Speaker 5] (1:27:34 - 1:27:42)
Is it in the ADU pilot area or what requires the zoning change?

[Speaker 18] (1:27:42 - 1:27:50)
The requirement for the zoning change is because of the fact that we needed to go to RT 3.5 in order to accomplish the construction we wanted.

[Speaker 5] (1:27:50 - 1:27:51)
To get the level of FAR?

[Speaker 18] (1:27:51 - 1:27:52)
Right, exactly.

[Speaker 5] (1:27:53 - 1:27:55)
Got it. Thank you, sir. You're welcome.

Thank you, Chair.

[Speaker 1] (1:27:56 - 1:28:04)
Thank you. Any other questions? If not, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 5] (1:28:04 - 1:28:05)
So moved.

[Speaker 1] (1:28:05 - 1:28:47)
Alderman LaSpada moves do pass. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. Up next, item number 22300T1 in the 32nd Ward. Ordinance referred 11.1.23. Common address is 2339 North Lister Avenue. Change request, M33 Heavy Industry District and RT4 Residential Two Flat Townhouse and Multi-Unit District to Sorry. M33 Heavy Industry District to RT4 Residential Two Flat Townhouse and Multi-Unit District. Sorry about that.

Fred Augustin.

[Speaker 24] (1:28:47 - 1:29:20)
Thank you, Chairman. Again, for the record, Fred Augustin with Law Offices of Augustin Associates LLC with offices at 150 South Wacker Street. I'm here on behalf of the applicant, Simon Ramirez.

The applicant does own the property at 2339 North Lister Avenue. Property is currently improved with a two-story residential building containing two units. The applicant is seeking to rezone the property from the existing M33 district to an RT4 district.

And just for the record, Chairman, it is a type one application, so narrative and plans were submitted.

[Speaker 1] (1:29:23 - 1:29:28)
Sorry, do I need to read it in the type one? Okay.

[Speaker 23] (1:29:28 - 1:29:31)
I just want to say for the record, that's all. Great. Thanks, Fred.

[Speaker 24] (1:29:33 - 1:29:50)
The plan is to keep the existing building. The reason for the change is the applicant would like to have a shared housing unit within the existing building. We have worked with Alderman Wagsback in his office.

I believe he did provide a letter of no objection. I'm here to answer any questions the committee may have.

[Speaker 1] (1:29:50 - 1:30:05)
Thank you. We do have a letter from Alderman Wagsback. Any questions by committee members?

Hearing none, Alderman Citro Lopez moves due pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

[Speaker 23] (1:30:05 - 1:30:05)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:30:05 - 1:30:31)
Thank you. On the bottom of page 7, item number 22277 in the 37th Ward, ordinance referred 10-423. Common address is 1418 North Luna Avenue.

Change request, RS3 residential single unit detached house district to RT3.5 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district. The attorney is Fernando Villan.

[Speaker 22] (1:30:38 - 1:31:29)
Members of the committee, I'm Fernando Villan. I'm appearing for the applicant, Manny's Management Incorporated. We're seeking a zoning change from RS3 residential single unit to RT3.5. My client seeks to legalize a basement apartment in an existing building with two units. So it would increase to three units. We've engaged the community. We've received no objections as of yet.

We've worked closely with Alderwoman Mitts as well. We do not have a letter of support from her yet, but we're expecting to have it early next week.

[Speaker 1] (1:31:31 - 1:31:36)
Alderwoman Mitts has been in touch with the committee. She did indicate her support on this, so we're going to proceed.

[Speaker 22] (1:31:36 - 1:31:38)
Excellent. Thank you, sir.

[Speaker 1] (1:31:38 - 1:31:52)
Any questions from committee members? Seeing none, Alderman Villegas moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, this item is passed.

[Speaker 22] (1:31:52 - 1:31:54)
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and committee.

[Speaker 1] (1:31:56 - 1:32:17)
Top of page 8 is item number 22291 in the 38th Ward. Ordinance referred 11.1.23. Common address is 6845 West Addison Street. Change request is B11 Neighborhood Shopping District to B31 Community Shopping District.

Presenting is Zubin Kamula.

[Speaker 23] (1:32:17 - 1:33:07)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My name is Zubin Kamula. I'm an attorney at Siegel Moses in Chicago, Illinois, and I'm appearing on behalf of the applicant, HK Banquet LLC.

The subject property is located at 6845 West Addison Street, and the applicant is seeking a zoning change to allow for resumption of a banquet hall business that existed there for many years. Some of you may be familiar with it. It was the Polynesian Village Banquet facility.

We've met with Alderman Sposato. He's in full support of the project, and we respectfully request your favorable recommendation.

[Speaker 1] (1:33:08 - 1:33:48)
Great. Thank you. Any questions by committee members?

Seeing none, Alderman Conway makes the motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine the subject property in the All in favor? Hearing none. This item is passed.

Thank you, and best of luck to you. Thank you. The change request is RS3 residential single unit detached district to RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district.

We have Paul Kolpak.

[Speaker 29] (1:33:49 - 1:34:19)
Congratulations. My name is Paul Kolpak. I'm from 6767 North Milwaukee Avenue.

I represent Cullum Avenue LLC. The request is from the RS3 to RT4. The property is currently a three-flat.

Unfortunately, it's not in an ADU area, so we have to come to the Zoning Committee to legalize the fourth unit. We've met with Alderman Sposato. He was in full support of adding the additional unit.

[Speaker 1] (1:34:20 - 1:34:28)
Great. And we do have the letter of support from Alderman Sposato. Any questions by committee members?

Alderman Sposato.

[Speaker 5] (1:34:29 - 1:34:51)
The briefest of comments, Jared. I think this is our third basement unit of the day, certainly making the case for policy work. I don't mean to harp on it, and I know that we're gonna do it.

I think I genuinely love having cases that, like, build the case for the policy work that we want to do. So thank you for it. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:34:51 - 1:35:31)
You're welcome. Thank you. Any other questions?

Seeing none, Alderman, Vice Mayor Burnett moves to do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, this item is passed.

Thank you. Bottom of page 8, item number 22299 in the 43rd Ward. Ordinance referred 11-1-23.

Common address is 1935 to 1943 North Sedgwick Street. Change request is an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to B3-2 community shopping district. We have attorney Nicholas Fatikas.

[Speaker 2] (1:35:32 - 1:36:18)
Thank you, Chairman. Again, for the record, Nick Fatikas from the Law Offices of Sam Banks. I am here on behalf of the applicant and property owner 1935 Sedgwick LLC.

The existing building is actually a mixed-use building on an irregularly shaped lot. Unfortunately, it was zoned RT4 and the commercial use, which I believe was formerly the Sedgwick's Bar, that license lapsed. So the zoning change being sought is to allow the reestablishment of a restaurant on the first floor of the building.

No other changes are proposed to the existing structure. The 12 units above grade will all remain. We did work with Alderman Knudson.

I know that he had sent correspondence and I had seen him earlier, but we believe we have support to proceed this morning.

[Speaker 1] (1:36:19 - 1:36:27)
Thank you. I know Alderman Knudson was here. I spoke to him and he did indicate his support.

What's the new business going in?

[Speaker 2] (1:36:27 - 1:36:46)
So it's Red River Dick's, which is a barbecue concept. We actually met with the Lincoln Central Association and their idea is to kind of blend different types of barbecue, but it's more of a traditional restaurant as opposed to what Sedgwick's. I'm not sure if you're familiar with a little bit of a different concept.

[Speaker 1] (1:36:46 - 1:37:28)
I do remember. All right, any questions by committee members? Seeing none, Alderman Villegas moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed. Thank you.

Next up, item number 22231T1 in the 32nd Ward, ordinance referred 71923. Common address is 3327 to 3335 North Lincoln Avenue. Change request.

B12 Neighborhood Shopping District and B13 Neighborhood Shopping District to B33 Community Shopping District. We have Nick Fitikas again.

[Speaker 2] (1:37:29 - 1:38:14)
So again, Chairman Nick Fitikas, for the record, I am here on behalf of the applicant and property owner 3327 North Lincoln Common LLC. I think most people know this property as the former Ginkgo's Bakery site. This program calls for a redevelopment of the property with a new six-story mixed-use building that will have retail at grade and a total of 42 residential units above.

It is a transit-served location. We are providing all of the affordable units on-site, and for that reason we are capturing the bonuses allowed under the transit-served location ordinance. On that point though, there were substitute plans and narrative that have been filed with staff, so I wanted to make sure that those were incorporated into the record.

[Speaker 1] (1:38:15 - 1:38:31)
All right, Alderman Villegas makes a motion to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type 1 application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the substitute narrative and plans are accepted.

[Speaker 2] (1:38:32 - 1:38:47)
Chairman, this went through an extensive community review process. There is a letter of support from Alderman Villegas back, but I also wanted to introduce John Splitt as our project architect who shepherded the design changes through the process, so if there were any questions, we'd be happy to answer them.

[Speaker 1] (1:38:47 - 1:39:34)
Great, thank you Mr. Matikas and Mr. Splitt, good to see you. Any questions by committee members? Hearing none, Alderman Sitio Lopez makes the motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, this item is passed with the substitute narrative and plans attached. In the hot seats.

Next up, item number 22286, T1 in the 32nd Ward. Ordinance referred 11123, common address 2515 North Clybourne Avenue. Change requests, M12 limited manufacturing business park district to RM 4.5 residential multi-unit district. Nick Matikas.

[Speaker 2] (1:39:34 - 1:40:14)
Thank you again Nick Matikas for the record. I'm here on behalf the applicant, Shawn's Givens, the contract purchaser of the subject property at 2515 North Clybourne. Currently it is a vacant property that the applicant is proposing to purchase and redevelop with a, or to develop, with a three-unit building with three parking spaces at the rear.

This is a mandatory type 1 zoning change because the current M1 zoning does not allow for residential uses to be established, but there is no substitute on this one. I wanted to make sure that was on the record. We did work again with the Alderman's office and a letter of support should already be on file with your, your staff.

[Speaker 1] (1:40:15 - 1:40:48)
Thank you. We do have the support of Alderman Wagaspak. Any questions by committee members?

Seeing none, Vice Mayor Burnett, moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, this item is passed.

All right, the bottom of page 9, item number 22289 in the 47th Ward. Ordinance referred 11-1-23. Common address, 4239 Northwestern Avenue.

Change request, B3-2 Community Shopping District to B2-3 Neighborhood Mixed-use District. Nick Fitikas.

[Speaker 2] (1:40:48 - 1:41:24)
Again, Chairman, for the record, Nick Fitikas, Law Offices of Sam Banks. I'm here on behalf, in this case, of the property owner and applicant, Western Front LLC. Again, subject property is 4531 Northwestern Avenue.

The change request, in this case, would allow the development of a new four-story, eight-unit residential building with on-site parking for eight vehicles at the rear of the site. In this case, we did work with the 47th Ward, the Zoning Advisory Committee, and Alderman Matt Martin has provided a letter of support which should already be on file with your office. I'd be happy to answer any other questions you might have about the proposal.

[Speaker 1] (1:41:25 - 1:41:59)
Thank you. We do have the support from Alderman Matt Martin. Any questions by committee members?

Seeing none, Alderman Ramirez-Rosa moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, this item is passed.

Top of page 10, item number 22290 in the 47th Ward. Ordinance referred 11-1-23. Common address, 4531 Northwestern Avenue.

Change request is a B3-2 Community Shopping District to B2-3 Neighborhood Mixed-use District. Nick Fitikas.

[Speaker 2] (1:41:59 - 1:42:24)
I'm back. Nick Fitikas for the record. In this case, Chairman, we are seeking again a zoning change to the B2-3 Zoning District to allow an eight-unit, four-story, eight-unit building.

Same, similar process to the previous case in the 47th Ward. We worked with the Zoning Advisory Committee and we do have a letter of support from the Alderman on file. I'd be happy to answer any questions you or the committee members have.

[Speaker 1] (1:42:24 - 1:42:30)
Thank you. We do have Alderman Martin's letter of support. Any questions by committee members?

Alderman LaSavada.

[Speaker 5] (1:42:30 - 1:42:35)
If I may, Mr. Fitikas, I'm just curious. Are we doing ground floor commercial with this development?

[Speaker 2] (1:42:36 - 1:42:43)
So on this one, no. It's an all-residential building. So a total of eight residential units, two per floor.

[Speaker 5] (1:42:46 - 1:42:59)
And it's not my ward and I'm gonna vote in favor. I'm just curious because we're like around the corner from Wilson and Western. I feel like there's commercial identity there.

Could you talk a little bit about that decision?

[Speaker 2] (1:43:00 - 1:43:38)
So I think generally speaking, there's a concern about the viability of new retail spaces and the comparisons, price comparisons. Not that it's over-saturated, but that there is available commercial space in the immediate area. And I think some community organizations take the position that adding appropriate density helps support the existing commercial.

And I think this project kind of fits that bill. At only eight units, it's not a massive development by comparison to what, you know, the committee's seen today. So I think it's more in line with, again, providing support for the existing businesses in the area.

[Speaker 5] (1:43:38 - 1:43:40)
That's a really fair argument. Thank you, sir.

[Speaker 1] (1:43:41 - 1:44:20)
Thank you. Any other questions? Hearing none, Alderman LaSvada moves due pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, this item is passed. All right, finally.

Item number 22254 in the 23rd Ward. Ordinance referred 91423. Common address is 5173 South Archer Avenue.

A change request. RT4, residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to B3-1, community shopping district to B3-1, community shopping district. On his last item, Nick Fitikas.

[Speaker 2] (1:44:20 - 1:45:01)
This is it. Nick Fitikas, again, for the record. Chairman, I am here on behalf of the applicant and property owner.

As you stated in the introduction, this is a split zone lot, so it's RT4 and B3-1. The proposed zoning change would establish a uniform B3-1 zoning district and ultimately the establishment of a new restaurant or cafe at the subject property. The existing one-story commercial building will remain.

Again, this is more of a use-based zoning change based on the split zoning, split underlining zoning. We did work with Alderman Tavares' office. I believe an email correspondence for support or in support was provided.

Again, be happy to answer any questions you or the committee members have.

[Speaker 1] (1:45:02 - 1:45:42)
Thank you. We do have the letter from Alderman Tavares. Any questions by committee members?

Hearing none, Alderman Villegas moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, this item is passed.

Thank you, sir. Thank you, Nick. Item number 22282-T1 in the 47th Ward.

Ordinance referred 10-423. Common address is 2250 to 56 West Irving Park Road, 4009 North Oakley Avenue. Change request is B33 Community Shopping District to B33 Community Shopping District.

We have Katrina McGuire.

[Speaker 19] (1:45:43 - 1:46:30)
Not a big change. Good morning, Mr. Vice Chair. Katrina McGuire from Thompson-Coburn here on behalf of the applicant Irving Oakley LLC.

This is for all intents and purposes an extension of a type 1 request that was initially granted back in October of 2021. The project went through a ZBA approval process and the applicant simply needs a little bit of extra time to complete their final permit approval drawings. And so in conference with Zoning Administrator Murphy, we concluded that the safest avenue was to go ahead and file a new type 1 amendment application for this.

We do have Alderman Martin's support. The project actually has been reduced by one unit from what was initially approved, but otherwise is in substantial conformance with the project as initially approved back in 2021.

[Speaker 1] (1:46:31 - 1:46:37)
Great, thank you. We do have the support from Alderman Martin. Any questions from committee members?

Alderman Villegas?

[Speaker 25] (1:46:38 - 1:46:45)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just a question around, so you came back for the same project, similar project.

[Speaker 19] (1:46:45 - 1:46:46)
That is correct.

[Speaker 25] (1:46:46 - 1:46:55)
Given the interest rate, the highest interest rates, how sure that we're going to actually get this project completed?

[Speaker 19] (1:46:56 - 1:47:07)
Probably just about as certain as anybody else's right now. They are working towards completing this project just because it has been pending for a long time, but clearly there's a lot of uncertainty in the market right now. Cool, thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:47:07 - 1:48:35)
Thank you. Any other questions? Hearing none, Alderman Ramirez-Rosa moves due pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, this item is passed. Thank you.

Thank you. All right, top of page 11 is item number 22250 in the 7th Ward. Ordinance referred 9, 14, 23.

Common address is 7901 through 11 South Exchange Avenue, 2933 to 41 East 79th Street, 7850 to 7872 South Exchange Avenue, 2908 through 30 East 79th Street, 7839 through 45 South Escanaba Avenue. Change request is an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district, B3-2 community shopping district, and C1-2 neighborhood commercial district, to C1-3 commercial neighborhood district, and then to a residential business plan development. We have Sylvia Mikus here on behalf of the ownership.

I know this item was heard and passed by the Chicago Plan Commission, and I have a motion to incorporate all records and findings from that hearing by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Alderman Espada still moves. Any objections?

Hearing none, the records are incorporated. Ms. Mikus, you may proceed.

[Speaker 3] (1:48:35 - 1:53:01)
Good morning, Vice Chairman Lawson and members of the committee. My name is Sylvia Mikus. I'm an attorney at the law firm of Taft, Stettinius, and Hollister.

I, along with my co-counsel, Graham Grady, represent the applicant, Thrive Exchange LLC. Also present and available for questions are Andrew Stables, senior development manager of DL3 Realty, and our project architect, Ashlyn Williams of Koo Architects. First, we would like to thank and acknowledge Alderman Greg Mitchell and his staff for their continued support of this project, as well as thank the staff of DPD, as well as DOH, CDOT, and other agencies that have contributed to this project.

So, the project. The subject property is located at the intersection of East 79th Street and South Exchange Avenue. The proposed plan development includes two parcels.

The parcel located at the southwest corner of 79th Street and Exchange Avenue, referred to as Thrive Exchange South or Subarea A, is partially owned by the applicant and the remainder is owned by the City of Chicago. The applicant plans to acquire the city-owned parcel and has been working with the departments on moving forward with that. The applicant is currently under contract with the owners of the property located at the northwest corner, which will be developed at a later date.

The subject property, as you can see on the zoning map, is, again, zoned within the RT4, B3, 2, and C1, 2 districts. Next slide. And now, the proposed development will include, again, in Subarea A, which is the initial phase of this development, a new six-story mixed-use affordable housing building, which will consist of, on the first floor, a retail space containing about 2,900 square feet, an office space of approximately 730 square feet to be occupied by the Neighborhood Housing Services of Chicago.

The first floor will also include a bike room and a lobby. The second floor will consist of a residential lounge, fitness center, roof deck, and seven dwelling units. And then the third through sixth floors will contain the remaining 36 dwelling units.

Again, all 43 units are affordable units with a 60% AMI. The project will also include a plaza. The proposed zoning height of the phase one building is 74 feet 4 inches.

This is also a transit-served location, as we are directly adjacent to the metro station, as well as about 29 feet from the 79th Street bus corridor. Again, as mentioned before, Subarea B will be developed as part of Phase 2, with a mixed-use affordable housing building consisting of similar uses and unit mix as the Phase 1 building. This development will be subject to site plan review and will also incur a courtesy presentation to the Chicago Plan Commission.

Again, in order to proceed forward with this project, the applicant is seeking a zoning amendment to rezone the property to a residential business plan development with an underlining zoning of a C1-3 district. In terms of the proposed development, in terms of significant economic and community benefits, again, we mentioned about the affordability for working families, pedestrian-friendly public realm improvements, including an active ground floor, widened sidewalks, a new plaza, improved streetscape with additional trees and other plantings, ground floor commercial space, a hundred plus temporary construction jobs, and it is the applicant's goal to exceed the 26.6% MBE-WBE participation goals. In closing, the applicant has conducted extensive community outreach over the last few years.

As a result of such efforts, in addition to the letter of support from Alderman Mitchell, which was submitted to the committee, the applicant secured letters of support from METRA and the South Shore Chamber of Commerce, as well as a local resident. This concludes our presentation. We are unaware of any opposition.

We thank you for your consideration of this application and are available for questions.

[Speaker 1] (1:53:02 - 1:53:08)
Thank you, Ms. Micas. We do have the support of Alderman Mitchell on this. Do we have any questions by committee members?

[Speaker 5] (1:53:10 - 1:53:40)
This was really a remarkable project when it came through plan commission a few weeks ago, and I'm glad that we're voting on it today. I wondered, and Commissioner Murphy, maybe if you could speak to this, we don't always talk about how these projects meet the sustainable development policy, but it does so through that it was that fascinating category that combines environmental equity and social equity. Do you know the one that I'm talking about, sir?

[Speaker 16] (1:53:42 - 1:53:51)
Patrick Murphy with the Department of Planning. I don't have that specific information. Sylvia, do you have any information on that on the slides for today that you could maybe go through?

[Speaker 3] (1:53:52 - 1:53:55)
We can answer it. It's not on the slides, but I'm going to turn it over to Ashlyn.

[Speaker 1] (1:53:56 - 1:53:58)
Just go ahead and state your name for the record and talk right into the mic.

[Speaker 28] (1:54:02 - 1:54:30)
Ashlyn Williams with COO. So the program that we will be pursuing is the Enterprise Green Communities like plan, which is a similar development policy or program like LEED or WELL, but it is specifically targeted to this type of development and sort of has a more equity and planning and management focus included in sort of Congress with the sustainable building and sustainable systems aspect as well.

[Speaker 5] (1:54:31 - 1:54:50)
I just thought it was fascinating. It's worth looking at, particularly if alders are looking to do affordable projects that require PDs that are looking to combine that environmental equity and social equity focus. It's a really great route to be taken, so I'm really glad that you are.

Thank you. Thank you, Chair.

[Speaker 1] (1:54:51 - 1:54:58)
Thank you. Any other questions by committee members? Actually, maybe you said this and I missed it, but what are the current uses on the sites?

[Speaker 3] (1:54:59 - 1:55:17)
It's currently, I believe, it was partially vacant and I believe there's on the phase one property at the southwest is, I believe, one two-story building and then the northwest parcel has, I believe, two, no, three buildings, I believe.

[Speaker 1] (1:55:18 - 1:55:35)
Great. Thank you. Thank you.

Any other questions? Hearing none, I get a motion to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Alderman Lisbata, thank you.

Any objections? Hearing none, this item is passed. Thank you.

As revised.

[Speaker 33] (1:55:35 - 1:55:36)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:55:36 - 1:57:35)
As revised. Thank you. Thank you.

Before we adjourn, we have five items that we're going to defer. I will read them all back in and take a motion at the end. On page two, item number A8833 in the ninth ward, ordinance referred 52423, common address 3119 East 103rd Street.

Hearing none, this item is deferred. There being no other business before the body, can I have a motion to adjourn? Alderman Conway moves to adjourn.

Any objections? Hearing none, we're adjourned. Thank you all.
