William. Yes. Mr. Reed, you can proceed.

[Speaker 18] (9:59 - 11:40)
Okay, I'm calling in opposition to the towing service at 400 West 107th Street zip code 60628. The towing service was, whatever, whatever the official name is, they just been a nuisance in the neighborhood, they run the stop signs they go around the cars they're sitting at the stop sign, they race up and down the street, all hours of the evening and all night. And they run like what 60 maybe 70 miles an hour.

I mean you can hear them racing their engines like they're trying to hurry and get to an accident or something, and they just literally did they have their car parts falling off their truck doors bumpers metal objects that's left in the street and then the neighbors have to come out and pull it to the side to get it out of the road, you know, and it just literally literally literally littered up the neighborhood, and the neighborhood, the whole area has just gone down I mean there's trash they don't clean up in front of their place. And it's just a nuisance.

You know, and my myself and the other neighbors, you know, we all talked about it and now we have a chance to voice our opinion I don't know how many will participate this morning but we're all in agreement that we're opposed to the to the to this place up here.

[Speaker 34] (11:42 - 11:44)
Mr. Mr. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (11:44 - 12:03)
Thank you for your comments I believe this item was on the life business licensing committee yesterday about booting on private property in the 10th Ward, and I know Alderman Garza spoke in regards to the same issues that you're mentioning at the public comment period, but this is the zoning committee, and that item. In front of us.

[Speaker 18] (12:03 - 12:32)
Yeah, they told us, they told us this is the committee that we supposed to call today. Let me see application number eight as an apple 8723 called this morning at 10 o'clock. ID number 8454-260-5040 passcode 683733.

And they said this this morning.

[Speaker 1] (12:33 - 12:47)
Okay, that's in care, Alderman Austin's. Yes. Okay, well we've got your comments, and we will make sure that we have Alderman Austin on we cannot address your comments in the public comment period you have anything else you want to add.

[Speaker 18] (12:51 - 13:07)
Um, well I did. Yeah, well, I pray that something can be done, that's positive to, you know, get this company removed out of the area they just popped up all of a sudden and now they're taking over.

[Speaker 1] (13:07 - 13:22)
All right. Thank you, Mr. Reed. Appreciate it.

All right, our second public speaker. We don't have a last name but obviously the first name is Marilyn, if, if Marilyn's on the call would you, first of all, identify yourself.

[Speaker 7] (13:24 - 13:25)
Good morning.

[Speaker 1] (13:27 - 13:34)
Good morning. Your, your last name. Your last name.

Okay, yes.

[Speaker 7] (13:34 - 16:33)
All right, proceed. Yes, good morning. I'm calling in regards to our war carry Austin.

This is what 34. And regarding the letter we received about making this call this morning on concerns and opposing for this towing services in the community now that staring up messing up disrespectful tearing up and all hours of the day and night and trucks, coming through, dropping off, along with the towing trucks is, it's been a big change in our area, and this community that is not needed to bring down our area, and then so disrespectful to the residents here.

And then stop signs, and almost causing accidents with each, each one of us maybe throughout this community that has spoken on this matter. I do hope that everyone is is zooming in or calling in and concerns for this matter, because we have taken it to our other woman. And so this is what we received.

I received a letter in the mail. There was a letter in the mail going out from the city of Chicago. Addressing this matter.

So, we assist community and hoping that this will not be this rezoning would cause them to be not in this area anymore because they're not needed to jump up in this area the way they have been doing leaving from one side of the street to the other. Torn up all in the middle of the streets. It's just, it's just been a headache.

It's been a stressful situations as they've come into this community, and we would appreciate. I didn't hear. Austin.

I didn't hear that all the person was on the line but we have spoken with them. And like I stated before, that this needs to be this needs to cease. We're taxpaying citizens here in this community that we should have, we should be heard or we should have been told before this even happened to be voted on to see if they should be able to come into the community and do what they're doing.

And like I stated about the track that the 18 will attract they come in late at night, wake us up, and they're right there on the corner. And in between the corner and the stop sign. And it's just terrible you look out your window and you get to see some of everything and this causes junk that they're bringing in and rodents you just don't we don't need that.

And we would appreciate it if someone would step forward and do what is necessary to remove what has come into our community for the work.

[Speaker 1] (16:37 - 16:40)
Thank you, Marilyn. Next speaker Christine James.

[Speaker 19] (16:46 - 16:47)
Good morning.

[Speaker 1] (16:47 - 16:48)
Good morning, Christine.

[Speaker 19] (16:48 - 19:11)
Good morning. Thank you for the opportunity to speak this morning. On behalf of the deferred and agenda item number 20657 brought by CHA, and known as the LeClaire courts project located on South Cicero Avenue between highway 55 and 45th Street in the 22nd Ward.

My name is Christine James, and I am director of real estate development at the greater Southwest Development Corporation, known as DSDC. I am a passionate committed longtime Southwest side resident, having lived worked and played in Chicago on for over 20 years now. My children graduated from Eberhardt Elementary School in Chicago lawn, a community just east of this development.

My husband is a teacher at Hubbard High School, also in West lawn, and, and I have worked at DSDC for almost 15 years now. DSDC is a delegate agency for the city of Chicago, and is a community development group based on the southwest side of Chicago. And our goal, primarily is to improve the quality of life in southwest Chicago through entrepreneurial commercial and residential real estate development.

And on behalf of DSDC, I'd like to express support for this development and the rezoning proposed here for the redevelopment of CHA, known as LeClaire courts. This development is going to be the largest development on the southwest side of Chicago outside of Midway Airport. The scope of this development has the potential to inject new life and opportunities for area nonprofits, local small businesses, Chicago residents and visitors alike.

We are so excited that this project will recreate much needed infrastructure will create a high number of jobs for local residents and assist local businesses, particularly women minority and veteran owned certified businesses, ensuring that they have an opportunity to work and benefit in this project. This opportunity to engage in robust partnership with LeClaire partners will allow the southwest side residents full transparency on this project, and as well as support LeClaire partners as they seek to deliver on their community promises. DSDC is prepared to hold LeClaire partners accountable should the project begin to stray from its community commitments.

And in summary, I'd like to endorse this project and urge the commission to approve the proposed zoning change today. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (19:14 - 19:18)
All right. Thanks, Christine. Our next speaker Michelle Strassburger.

[Speaker 34] (19:26 - 19:31)
Hello. Hello.

[Speaker 1] (19:32 - 19:33)
Yes, Michelle.

[Speaker 8] (19:33 - 19:35)
Yes, this is Michelle Strassburger.

[Speaker 1] (19:36 - 19:37)
Okay, proceed.

[Speaker 8] (19:37 - 22:43)
Okay, good morning chair members and committee members. My name is Michelle Strassburger, and I reside in West town, representing one of almost 43,000 housing units and own properties 1228 and 1230 West Hubbard Street, which is composed of three pin numbers since 1993. And I say this because this these properties are directly north across the train tracks from the proposed development.

I am strongly opposing the proposed development for 400 North Elizabeth doc number 20712, specifically the rezoning of the new existing DX3 property to a DX5 with permission to expand to the equivalent of a DX8.1. If a life science office building is to be built, I strongly support an up zone to DX3 with a 1.0 FAR bonus and overall FAR of 4.0 versus 8.1 would satisfactorily result in a lower density building, which would be more in keeping with the adjacent residential buildings in the neighborhood. Less density would equal less pedestrian and vehicle traffic, less crime, fewer accidents, less congestion, reduced truck traffic hazards, less safety hazards, and less strain on our already ancient infrastructure, which goes our water system which goes back to like 1895.

Not to mention the structural damage sustained by the surrounding residential residential buildings, including my own when demolition and construction digging start. Parking is also a main concern. According to the developers, I'm wondering where will 2400 construction workers and 1350 life science workers park.

And even though they state only two or 300 workers will be in the building at the same time, how is 123 parking spots adequate, unless they mandate their employees take public transportation, because there is no parking available, extra parking available in this residential neighborhood. A DX3 zoning with an FAR of up to 4.0 is way more in keeping with the significantly reduced height of the established residential R4 and M zone buildings directly across the street to the east and across the tracks on Hubbard Street east of Ogden from the proposed site. I realize change is inevitable, but the existing residential residents would have should have some say as far as the density is concerned, in order to benefit the coexisting harmonious.

[Speaker 1] (22:49 - 22:53)
Our final speaker, Jennifer Ruman. Jennifer.

[Speaker 9] (22:57 - 23:00)
Yes, good morning. Confirming you can hear me.

[Speaker 1] (23:00 - 23:02)
We can proceed.

[Speaker 9] (23:02 - 26:10)
Okay, thank you. Good morning chairman and team council members. This is in regard to file number 20712.

My name is Jennifer Ruman, and I reside in the 1200 block of West Hubbard Street, which is situated within 250 feet of the subject land development of 400 North Elizabeth. I am an appointed speaker today on behalf of potentially impacted neighbors, and the extended community that stand in strong opposition for countless reasons, some of which were just addressed by my neighbor Michelle Strassburger. As a matter of record, I wish to state that the following criteria, regardless of applicable guidelines governing the Kinzeke Industrial Corridor development, do not even remotely adhere to standard Chicago zoning ordinances, which I will quickly outline as follows.

Number one, this development is not in the interest of the public convenience and will have a significant adverse impact on the general welfare of the neighborhood and community. Number two, it is not compatible with the character of the surrounding area in terms of site planning and building scale and project design. Number three, it is not compatible with the character of the surrounding area in terms of operating characteristics such as hours of operation, outdoor lighting, noise and traffic generation.

And four, it is not designed to promote pedestrian safety and comfort. Specifically, and I will be abbreviating this in lieu of time, here are a few of the most significant concerns that remain unaddressed to date. I would request and appreciate the opportunity to expand upon them at a future date.

Location, no added value to the public and neighboring residents, traffic congestion, parking, ingress and egress to the subject development. Height, scale, density, physical barriers, pedestrian safety, crime, compromise to the existing culture of the neighborhood, infrastructure, hardscape versus landscape, no green space, incomplete plans, too many open-ended items to be addressed at quote, a later date. In light of the rules limiting testimony length and also prohibiting the use of exhibits to the extent that a fair and reasonable position could possibly be impactful this morning, I respectfully ask to be heard with open ears and conscientious minds for the remainder of time I have to speak this morning, and I'm going to speak quickly.

I recognize that what I'm going to ask of you is a rather bold and unconventional request, but be assured that I would not do so if I did not believe it to be a sound and reasonable one. Please consider a vote to defer this decision to your next meeting to allow further due diligence to occur. This is a unique parcel of land that is unlike all other sites that have been selected for rezoning and the Fulton Market.

There is no oral testimony or visual presentation that would adequately serve to promote an informed decision absent of an actual physical assessment. And with that said, I would like to invite some or all of you to pay a visit to this neighborhood and allow a few of us to take you for a stroll and talk through our concerns. Regardless of what you believe to know based on the expert testimony, the fancy renderings, and the undeniable compelling upside to growth and economic development, it would be unconscionable to vote in favor of this specific development without first assessing for yourself whether or not this development is compatible with existing neighborhoods.

[Speaker 1] (26:11 - 26:24)
Thank you, Jennifer. That concludes the public speaking portion of the hearing. We are now going to start with the addendum to the agenda.

We have one text amendment.

[Speaker 2] (27:52 - 28:16)
We're asking to allow, we're asking to amend the PMD to allow for these restaurants to be able to have outdoor cafes like every other restaurant throughout the city of Chicago and also for the people who work in these areas to be able to enjoy the outdoors and the fresh air like everyone else in the city of Chicago.

[Speaker 34] (28:18 - 28:20)
So we ask for the committee report on that.

[Speaker 1] (28:25 - 28:32)
Thank you, Chairman Burnett. We do have a question or two. We'll start with Alderman Ray Lopez.

Raymond.

[Speaker 17] (28:34 - 28:56)
Thank you, Chairman, and good morning members of the committee. Actually, I just had a quick question. I thought we were allowing all restaurants to be able to have the outdoor option because of COVID.

Is there, was there a particular exclusion just because they're in a PMD from what was authorized by BACP a year and a half or so ago? Or is this for a more permanent status?

[Speaker 1] (28:58 - 29:08)
Raymond, I think, I think Walter will answer. I know we have Patrick Murphy on from zoning, but I believe this is, would be permanent and nothing to do with the COVID exemption.

[Speaker 2] (29:09 - 30:18)
Yeah, this is permanent, Alderman, you're correct. Even though they did make exceptions during the pandemic, it did not apply, it did not apply in the PMD. So we're asking now to give them the same opportunities as other restaurants than you have across the city.

Not only that, we have not only restaurants. I don't know if you all are aware that over in PMD 4, in my ward, I probably have more breweries than most areas concentrated and it's actually become the brewery area. And most of these breweries serve food also.

And you know, and the good thing about them is that they're not around residents, it's just businesses and most of the businesses, employees and everyone goes to these establishments and we want to get them an opportunity to enjoy the fresh air just like everyone else.

[Speaker 17] (30:18 - 30:34)
But then I guess my question, Chairman, would be why are we not pursuing this as a citywide policy for all restaurants or breweries and PMDs so that they have the same option as well to be able to make use of outdoor spacing and dining and options like that?

[Speaker 1] (30:36 - 30:51)
Well, we can ask Patrick to talk about it, but each PMD is unique. And some of them, I don't think even have restaurants, you know, so, but Patrick, do you want to answer Alderman Lopez's question? Sure.

Hi, good morning, Alderman and Chairman.

[Speaker 17] (30:52 - 30:53)
Yes. Good morning, Patrick. Hi.

[Speaker 20] (30:54 - 32:23)
So to dovetail on what the Alderman or what the Chairman was saying, right, not all PMDs are structured the same and some of them don't have many or some of them don't, A, don't have allowances for some types of restaurant uses by right and some don't have a very high quantity of restaurants seeking any type of outdoor space. We are trying to approach the, you know, changes in these PMDs in a very measured way and consistent with how we handle other non-manufacturing uses in these PMDs. So whether it deals with restaurants or outdoor spaces or retail functions, we try to do it on a smaller scale basis in a very focused manner to address specific issues in PMDs because they're not all, they don't all function or not all are not all laid out the same.

And then regarding your earlier question, yes, BACP did allow for some temporary uses. One of these facility, one of the restaurants in PMD 4 did take advantage of that, but this is like Alderman Burnett was saying, seeking to allow it on a permanent basis in a couple of the PMDs. And I will also add that PMD 9 is included in this as well as the PMD in Burnett's Ward in Goose Island and Kinsey.

PMD 9 is included in Ramirez Rosa's Ward because that is where the Portillo's is already established and has an outdoor patio space. And that language was erroneously excluded the last time there was a text update in the PMDs. So it's only seeking to reestablish a use that PMD already allowed.

[Speaker 17] (32:25 - 32:26)
Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (32:27 - 32:32)
Thank you, Raymond. Alderman La Spada, you have your hand up.

[Speaker 13] (32:32 - 33:16)
Yes, sir. Thank you, Chairman. Sorry, I really appreciate this.

Not a committee member. I just wanted to make sure that we've considered that the use is going to be healthy. Because I know a PMD is essentially, well, by its nature, manufacturing and industry oriented.

I feel like the noise, the emissions concerns could affect the enjoyment of our outdoor diners. I feel like that might be why in the past we've prohibited this. What have we heard from the businesses who are interested in outdoor cafes?

How do they plan to mitigate that kind of impact of literally being in a PMD?

[Speaker 1] (33:21 - 33:25)
Who would like to answer that? Well, I can answer some of that.

[Speaker 2] (33:25 - 35:15)
So for instance, Alderman, I have Goose Island. Goose Island Brewery is in my ward, right? They manufacture and also they deliver beer all over the city and the country.

And right across the street in their manufacturing company, they serve food and they allow for folks to come in and eat and drink, but also they allow them to be on the sidewalk. Basically, what we're doing is bringing all of these folks into compliance, because some are doing it already to make them legit. They don't have a problem with their own trucks bothering their patrons.

I think the patrons come there because they want to be around the ambiance of being in a manufacturing area and being where the beer is manufactured at, right? So they do these tours with them. They show them how the beer is made, and then they let them go sit outside.

And in all of these breweries that we have in our area, they all have the beer making silos right there for folks to see. And the folks see them actually make it, right? And they have their trucks to pick them up and deliver them and all of that stuff.

So people are right there involved with it already. So we're just basically trying to bring them into compliance. And not only that, these places are getting so popular.

It's becoming like a tourist attraction for folks to come in and see these things, that they need more space. And the outdoor space gives them more space for people to be able to gather at these places.

[Speaker 13] (35:16 - 35:34)
Well, I appreciate it, sir. And I have at least a tiny little piece of PMD4 myself, so I appreciate what you're trying to accomplish here. I just want to make sure that we're doing it in a way that's going to be healthy for patrons and the businesses alike.

But yeah, appreciate your response. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (35:34 - 35:46)
Thank you, Chairman. Thank you. I don't see any other hands up.

Can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine Quorum?

[Speaker 24] (35:47 - 35:48)
So moved by Alderman Cardona.

[Speaker 1] (35:49 - 36:21)
Alderman Cardona makes the motion. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the amendment is passed.

Staying on the addendum, we have one historical landmark fee waiver in the Third Ward, located at 1936 South Michigan. Let's see, we do not have a presentation on this, but we do have Michelle Rimes here from the Historical Landmark Division of DPD. If there are any questions, and I know Alderman Pat Dollett is on the call also.

So let's start with Michelle.

[Speaker 31] (36:22 - 37:24)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. The agenda item before you is a request by the Board of Trustees of Second Presbyterian Church of Chicago to have a permit fee waiver in the amount of $6,500 for an expenditure of $1 million that they plan to extend for interior and exterior renovations and rehabilitation of their four-story parish house and the installation of an accessible stairway on the south entry of the church. This building is a landmark building.

It is also on the National Register of Historic Places. Alderman Pat Dollett is in support of this project and is in this meeting today.

[Speaker 1] (37:26 - 37:33)
Thank you, Michelle. Alderman Dollett, please, on the 1936 South Michigan. I know it's a beautiful facility.

[Speaker 7] (37:34 - 37:59)
Yes, thank you, Chairman. This is a beautiful historic church, Second Presbyterian in the South Loop. They have been working, the congregation and the pastor, Pastor Neff, have been working to restore areas of the facility and I'm thankful for the committee and would appreciate their support on this waiver.

[Speaker 1] (38:03 - 38:26)
Thank you, Chairman Dollett. Any questions for the department or the alderwoman? Hearing none, I get a motion to move due pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Alderman Hatton makes that motion. Any objections to her motion? Hearing none, the fee waiver is passed.

[Speaker 31] (38:27 - 38:28)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (38:28 - 41:30)
Thank you. All right, moving on, we have large signs over 100 square feet in area, 24 feet above grade. We will hear them all together.

I will read the ward followed by the address and take a motion at the end. One sign in the first ward located at 2432 North Milwaukee Avenue. Another sign in the first ward located at 2606 North Elston.

Four signs in the second ward at 1 West Chicago Avenue. Five signs in the second ward at 3 West Chicago Avenue. And one sign in the second ward located at 1000 West North Avenue.

Three signs in the third ward located at 2300 South State Street. One sign in the eighth ward at 9110 South Stony Island. One sign in the 17th ward at 7051 Southwestern Avenue.

One sign in the 21st ward at 125 West 87th Street. Two signs in the 27th ward at 215 North Peoria Street. One sign in the 27th ward at 1155 West Fulton Market.

One sign in the 31st ward at 4039 West Diversity Avenue. Three signs in the 42nd ward at 110 North Wacker Drive. One sign in the 42nd ward at 300 North Michigan.

If there are no questions by committee members, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? So moved by Alderman David Moore. Alderman David Moore makes the motion.

Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the orders are passed. We will now move on to the regular agenda in an effort to minimize technical difficulties and to ensure the committee meeting runs as smoothly as possible.

The typical order in which items will be heard has been updated. Throughout the duration of virtual committee on zoning meetings, items will be grouped together according to the witness attorney and will be heard in that order rather than the traditional ward order. So we are item page one on the revised agenda.

That item is Aldermanic 8726 in the 45th ward. The ordinance was referred on September 14th of 2021. This common address is 5330 to 5338 West Argyle Avenue.

And the change request RM5 residential multi-unit district to RS3 residential single unit detached house district. Alderman Gardner.

[Speaker 33] (41:31 - 42:30)
Yes, thank you, Chairman Tunney and committee members. This property has been the cause of a lot of controversy within our community since 2016. When it was abruptly changed from an RS3 to an RM5 to allow for a four-story 48 unit apartment building that would have been built amongst a neighborhood filled with single family homes and two flats.

Due to the height and density of this building, many neighbors and community groups expressed their valid concerns and the impact such a development would have on our community. By rezoning this property back to its 2016 zoning in RS3, it will help ensure the development of single family homes and two flats as opposed to a large scale project that would have real consequences to residents who have lived in this area for decades. I humbly ask for the committee's favorable vote on behalf of our community to ensure zoning that is most palatable to our constituents.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (42:32 - 42:44)
Thank you, Alderman Gardner. Um, any questions for the Alderman? If not, can I get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 24] (42:46 - 42:47)
So moved by Alderman Cardona.

[Speaker 1] (42:47 - 42:55)
Alderman Cardona makes the motion. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

[Speaker 33] (42:56 - 42:57)
Thank you, sir.

[Speaker 1] (42:57 - 43:08)
Now we're on the bottom of page one. Since in the 44th ward, my vice chair, my capable, extraordinary vice chair, Rob Boyce will take the helm on this item.

[Speaker 17] (43:08 - 43:26)
I like those adjectives. Next item on the agenda is item number A-8725 for the property commonly known as 3504 North Clark Street. We have chairman Tunney to speak on this matter before us.

[Speaker 1] (43:27 - 44:05)
The change request is a B3-3 community shopping district to a B3-2 community shopping district. Chairman Tunney. Thank you, vice chair.

This is a kind of a routine matter. We approved a TOD development on this corner, fell out of financing, and we've been very patient on trying to get this project ahead and to no avail. And after about three years, I decided that we need to return the zoning back to its original B3-2 and would ask consideration for my colleagues to support me on this automatic application.

[Speaker 17] (44:05 - 44:09)
Chairman, you're saying it's routine. I say it's a little cleanup. We're doing some cleanup here.

[Speaker 1] (44:11 - 44:19)
Well, I'm generally a patient man, but this one has worn me very thin. Thank you, sir. There are no questions.

[Speaker 17] (44:20 - 44:25)
Alderman Cardona makes a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

[Speaker 1] (44:26 - 44:58)
Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed. Thank you, vice chair.

All right, top of page two, item number A8724 in the 35th ward. Ordinance was referred on September 14th of 2021. This common address is 3335 West Fullerton Avenue.

The change requests C12 neighborhood commercial district to B3-1 community shopping district. Alderman Ramirez-Rosa.

[Speaker 34] (44:59 - 45:00)
Carlos?

[Speaker 1] (45:11 - 45:46)
Alderman Ramirez-Rosa. Carlos? Okay, we're gonna hold on this.

We're gonna hold on the item until we get Alderman Ramirez-Rosa on. So I'm going to skip that one. Second item on page two.

Alderman Austin, are you here on your automatic? All right, we're gonna hold that one also. How about Alderman Curtis?

[Speaker 13] (45:47 - 45:48)
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 1] (45:52 - 46:24)
Okay, we don't have Curtis. How about Alderman Cardenas on 3900 South Ashland? All right, I think they're in hibernation.

So let's see if we can skip those over. How about Alderman King? Okay, so we have representative from Alderman King's office.

I think Prentice is on the call. Prentice, are you there? Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 28] (46:25 - 46:27)
Alderman King will be on in just a moment. Hold on a moment.

[Speaker 1] (46:27 - 46:29)
Okay, I'm gonna read it into the record.

[Speaker 28] (46:29 - 46:29)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (46:30 - 46:59)
All right, okay, we're on the top of page three. Item number A8719 in the fourth ward. Ordinance was referred on September 14th of 2021.

Common address is 4644 through 4658 South Drexel Boulevard. Also 832 through 850 East 47th Street. The change request, B11 neighborhood shopping district to an RM5 residential multi-unit district.

Alderwoman King.

[Speaker 28] (47:03 - 47:09)
Chairman, just give her a moment. She's coming in right now. She's logging into the meeting.

I do apologize. She's coming right now.

[Speaker 1] (47:43 - 47:48)
Prentice, you wanna give her five to get settled? We'll just move on to the next item and come back to her?

[Speaker 28] (47:49 - 47:54)
No, literally she's jumping in right now. So let's just go ahead and take care of this now. She's ready.

[Speaker 1] (47:54 - 47:56)
Okay, Alderwoman King.

[Speaker 28] (48:03 - 48:05)
Does your team see her yet? Logged in?

[Speaker 1] (48:07 - 48:40)
He hasn't logged in according to our side. All right, Prentice, I'll give you about three or four minutes and we'll come back to you. Is she here?

All right. I think I'm here. Yep, there you are.

Okay, Alderwoman King, we're on the 4658 South Drexel on the Aldermanic.

[Speaker 27] (48:45 - 48:47)
Hey, Chairman, am I up? I'm sorry.

[Speaker 1] (48:47 - 48:48)
Yes, you're up.

[Speaker 27] (48:48 - 48:49)
I was switching to panelists.

[Speaker 1] (48:51 - 49:06)
We have her. You're on board. We read into the record the 4644 South Drexel Aldermanic.

Would you like to tell the committee your motive on this one, please?

[Speaker 27] (49:06 - 50:21)
Yeah, so we initially changed the zoning for this lot, particularly for a workout facility. And we had always had in mind with the developer that we would change the zoning back again because it's such an important spot on Drexel Boulevard. And so we are just doing as we intended, down zoning back to where it was.

And this was something that, again, we had agreed upon with the developer from the very beginning. It also turns out now that during COVID, this particular development did not survive and they are looking to lease the space. So we'd like to really maintain the original zoning to preserve that area on Drexel Boulevard, which is such a treasured area in the community.

So I appreciate your support on this.

[Speaker 1] (50:22 - 50:29)
Thank you, Alderwoman King. For the record, we're going from B11 to an RM5, correct?

[Speaker 34] (50:30 - 50:31)
Yes. Okay, great.

[Speaker 1] (50:32 - 50:51)
Questions from committee members? I don't see any hands up. Can I get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

Alderman Cardona makes that. Who made the motion? Alderman Cardona makes the motion.

[Speaker 34] (50:52 - 50:52)
The other one.

[Speaker 1] (50:52 - 51:29)
Passed by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Thank you, Alderwoman. Thank you, chairman. Thank you, the committee.

So page three, document number A8710, in the first ward. Ordinance was referred on June 25th of 2021. The common address, 1523 West Frye Street.

And the change request from a B23 neighborhood mixed-use district to an RM4.5 residential multi-unit district. Alderman LaSpada.

[Speaker 13] (51:33 - 51:39)
Could you... Sorry, I was off for a moment. Would you repeat the item?

[Speaker 1] (51:40 - 51:48)
This is your Aldermanic, 1523 West Frye, from a B23 to an RM4.5. Yes.

[Speaker 13] (51:48 - 52:12)
Thank you, chairman. My apologies. So chairman and committee members, I'm actually going to ask you to defer from today for a motion to defer this licensee, who we support, is still about four months away from getting their permits.

And so we would like to wait for the right time to pass this. Thank you, though. And I apologize for any confusion there.

[Speaker 1] (52:19 - 52:24)
So Daniel, I'm sorry. You have a project that's being stalled, is that correct?

[Speaker 13] (52:25 - 52:33)
It is, sir. We believe eventually it's going to move forward. But I would prefer if we can hear this item on an agenda in March 2022.

[Speaker 1] (52:35 - 52:41)
So you're deferring specifically to March of 22? If you would. Yes, please.

[Speaker 16] (52:41 - 52:41)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (52:42 - 52:50)
Any questions from committee members? I need a motion to defer this item.

[Speaker 34] (52:51 - 52:52)
Riley, so moved.

[Speaker 1] (52:53 - 53:05)
Alderman Riley makes the motion to defer. Any objections to the motion? Hearing none, the item is deferred to date certain March of 2022.

Is that correct, Alderman LaSpada?

[Speaker 13] (53:06 - 53:08)
That is correct. Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (53:08 - 53:35)
Okay, we're going to stay in the first ward on their next item. It's Alderman 8711 in the first ward. Ordinance was deferred on February 26th of 2021.

This address, common address is 1576 North Milwaukee Avenue. And the change request from C22, Motor Vehicle Related Commercial District, to be 22, Neighborhood Mixed Use District. Again, Alderman LaSpada.

[Speaker 13] (53:35 - 54:20)
Thank you so much, Chair. Colleagues, so the upzoning that we originally passed on this site was to allow for the permitting of an indoor outdoor service window for a Foxtrot location that is open here. Indoor outdoor window in place.

The business is doing great. It was approved though, originally by our constituents, our community group, with the understanding that for the uniformity, the clarity of the zoning area that we would down zone after permitting and the installation had been completed. So that is the ordinance I am bringing to you today.

And I would very much appreciate your favorable consideration.

[Speaker 1] (54:28 - 54:41)
All right, questions for Alderman LaSpada? All right, I don't see any hands up. Can I get a motion moved to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 23] (54:42 - 54:43)
Riley, so moved.

[Speaker 1] (54:43 - 55:35)
Alderman Riley makes the motion. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, this item is passed.

All right, we're going to move on to the bottom of page three. This is document number 20849, 47th Ward. Ordinance was referred on October 14th of 2021.

Common address is 3350 North Ashland Avenue. And the change request from a B3-2 Community Shopping District to a B2-3 Neighborhood Mixed Use District. Sarah Barnes is the attorney for this case.

Sarah? All right, Sarah Barnes. Welcome back, Sarah.

[Speaker 3] (55:35 - 57:34)
Thank you. I got locked in purgatory for a few minutes. Good morning, Mr. Chairman and esteemed members of the committee. For the record, my name is Sarah Barnes, and I'm an attorney with the Lopses of Sandbank. I'm happy to be here this morning on behalf of the applicant 3350 North Ashland, LLC. We are here this morning on an application to change the underlying zoning at the subject property from a B3-2 to a B2-3, which will allow for the construction of a new four-story with a basement, eight-unit condominium building, which will feature four interior parking spaces, as well as four exterior parking spaces, so that each of the units will be deeded at least one parking space.

As well, there's some landscape elements that were incorporated into the programming for the new development per our ongoing engagement with the community and the 47th Ward Zoning Advisory Committee. Toward those same ends, as part of the community engagement, we did meet with Alderman Martin, as well as, again, the 47th Ward Zoning Advisory Committee, and to the Planning and Development Committee of the Lakeview Roscoe Village Chamber of Commerce to go over this proposal, and we garnered some feedback, incorporated that into the ultimate programming for the development, and we are happy to be here this morning with the support of both Alderman Martin, the Zoning Advisory Committee, and the Lakeview Roscoe Village Chamber of Commerce.

With that, I'm happy to answer any questions that the committee may have, but we just very respectfully request your support for this proposal.

[Speaker 1] (57:35 - 57:49)
Thank you, Sarah. We do have letter of support from Alderman Martin. Any questions by committee members?

Hearing none, can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 24] (57:50 - 57:51)
So moved by Alderman Cardona.

[Speaker 1] (57:52 - 58:25)
Alderman Cardona makes the motion. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the item's passed.

We're now on the top page four. In the 32nd Ward, document number 20863, ordinance was referred on October 14th of 2021. Common address is 1860 North Milwaukee Avenue, and the change request, B33 Community Shopping District to M12 Limited Manufacturing Business Park District.

Sarah Barnes.

[Speaker 3] (58:25 - 58:29)
Good morning once more, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (58:29 - 58:30)
Sarah, you need to speak up.

[Speaker 3] (58:30 - 59:30)
Oh, sorry. Good morning once more, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. Again, for the record, my name is Sarah Barnes, and I'm an attorney with the Law Offices of Sam Banks.

Happy to be here again this morning on behalf of the applicant, 1860 North Milwaukee Comet, LLC. Before I continue, Mr. Chairman, I would like to note for the record that based on our ongoing engagement with the Alderman's Office, as well as the Bucktown Community Organization, and the Department of Planning and Development for the city, we did submit a substitute ordinance approximately a week, a little over a week ago. We tendered that to the Department of Planning and Development and to your office, Mr. Chairman. So I would like for the record to reflect that this will be approved pursuant to a substitute ordinance that will be taking the underlying zoning from a B-3-3 to a B-1-3.

[Speaker 1] (59:32 - 59:58)
All right. So Alderman Waguespack moves to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to this motion?

Hearing none, the substitute's before us. And again, just to reiterate, we're going from B-3-3 to B-what? B-1-3.

To B-1-3.

[Speaker 34] (59:59 - 59:59)
Okay.

[Speaker 25] (1:00:00 - 1:00:09)
B-3-3 is the current zoning, isn't it? Yes. So the substitute, we're substituting the M-1-2, doesn't it?

[Speaker 1] (1:00:09 - 1:00:09)
Correct.

[Speaker 25] (1:00:10 - 1:00:11)
Not the B-3-3.

[Speaker 1] (1:00:11 - 1:00:29)
No, we're going, the new zoning is B-1-3 after, now that we accepted the substitute. Nicole hasn't had her coffee yet this morning, so just wanted to add some levity to that. All right.

Amen. So you can carry on. Now the substitute's in front of us.

[Speaker 3] (1:00:29 - 1:03:12)
Thank you so much. So this one's gone through a couple of transitions, even since the time of submission. And this matter is a little bit confusing from the inception because in June of 2019, a type one zoning amendment was ratified affecting this property, changing the zoning to the current B-3-3 zoning to allow for a cigar lounge.

That proposal was never effectuated by the prior owner and the property, which has a one-story industrial building, has remained vacant for those last two years. The applicant recently acquired the property and in an effort to reactivate that building, has entered into a letter of intent with a grocery delivery service, which as many of you, I'm sure know, has become quite popular over the last year and not only popular, but necessary. The particular tenant that will be taking the building should the zoning change be approved is also interesting because it is a grocery delivery company.

However, all of the couriers are on bicycle. There's no vehicles. So all of the deliveries are made via bicycle.

So there was some interesting programming that went on with this. We worked very closely as well contemporaneous to the zoning change application with Alderman Wagesback's office, as well as the city's Department of Planning and Development. Towards that end, there is another change, although it doesn't require a substitute, but just for the reflection of the committee, the original proposal was to allow for a warehouse use because we thought that this was how it would be categorized since the facility will be used as kind of a grocery store where the couriers will come and pick up the packages and then deliver them to the different residents in the neighborhood that use the service. However, we submitted contemporaneous to this application.

We submitted a request for an advisory opinion to the Department of Planning and Development who has determined that the proper categorization for this type of use is food and beverage retail sales. So as a result, that's how we came to the proper corresponding underlying zoning of a B-1-3.

[Speaker 1] (1:03:14 - 1:03:23)
So- All right, let's hear from the Alderman. I think we can probably get something, a cliff note version of this thing, all right?

[Speaker 30] (1:03:23 - 1:04:09)
Yeah. Thank you, Chairman. Yes, it's for bicycle food delivery.

So if you order something, it might take you a little while to get it, Chairman, up by you. But no, I just want to say Sarah and the owner have the patience of saints because we've been going back and forth on this for quite a while. We've had the changes there from the prior zoning that we needed for that prior application that fell through, but this is for online grocery delivery.

And for purposes of planning, we need to pass the substitute ordinance, which I fully support along with the zoning change. And I would ask for the committee's favorable support of that change and as outlined by Attorney Barnes.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:09 - 1:04:26)
All right. So any questions for the Alderman first and then the attorney second? Because we've got a long agenda today, Sarah.

All right. Sounds interesting. It sounds like, Scott, they're going to be the shoppers and the couriers.

[Speaker 30] (1:04:28 - 1:04:39)
Under this new model, which I haven't seen in operation yet. That's true. And we did pass the substitute, correct?

That was accepted?

[Speaker 26] (1:04:39 - 1:04:40)
We did. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:41 - 1:04:42)
All righty.

[Speaker 3] (1:04:42 - 1:04:50)
Looking to open 50 more in the city. So any other Alderman who want them in their neighborhood, let us know.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:51 - 1:04:53)
Have they identified who the actual brand is or what?

[Speaker 3] (1:04:55 - 1:05:09)
It's a company that was based in the East Coast. It's called Bjork. Say it again.

It's called Bjork. It's B-U-Y-K. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:05:09 - 1:05:13)
Well, since they're going to try to expand, we should know what it is.

[Speaker 3] (1:05:13 - 1:05:14)
Absolutely.

[Speaker 1] (1:05:15 - 1:05:15)
All right.

[Speaker 3] (1:05:15 - 1:05:17)
Like I said, I'm sure they'll be reaching out to all of you.

[Speaker 1] (1:05:17 - 1:05:22)
Any questions for the Alderman or the attorney?

[Speaker 17] (1:05:23 - 1:05:28)
No, just for Sarah Barnes to reach out to Alderman David Moore. All right.

[Speaker 3] (1:05:28 - 1:05:30)
I got you. I got you, Alderman Moore.

[Speaker 1] (1:05:30 - 1:05:37)
David, you want to make a motion to move to pass on the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 34] (1:05:38 - 1:05:40)
Absolutely. Thank you, Sarah.

[Speaker 1] (1:05:40 - 1:05:47)
Any objections to Alderman Moore's motion? Hearing none, this item is passed as substituted.

[Speaker 34] (1:05:48 - 1:05:49)
Thank you, Sarah.

[Speaker 1] (1:05:50 - 1:06:02)
Now I got one more with Sarah, and then I'm going to go back to, I think Alderman Ramirez-Rosas is on the call. I'm going to go back. But Sarah, this is your last application.

So let's get to this one, okay?

[Speaker 34] (1:06:03 - 1:06:04)
Got it.

[Speaker 1] (1:06:04 - 1:06:26)
I'll try. I'll read it. Okay.

So this is item number 20802-T1 in the 47th ward. The ordinance is referred on July 21st of 21. The common address is 2042 through 2046 West Irving Park.

Change request. B-1-1, Neighborhood Shopping District. B-2-3, Neighborhood Mixed Use District.

Sarah?

[Speaker 3] (1:06:27 - 1:07:07)
Thank you again, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee for the last time today. My name is Sarah Barnes, and I'm an attorney with the Law Offices of Sam Banks. Happy to be here this morning on behalf of the applicant, 2042 West Irving LLC.

Once more, before I continue, Mr. Chairman, prior to this hearing, we did tender a substitute narrative and plans to the Department of Planning and Development and to your office. I would respectfully ask that those substitute materials be adopted into the record here today. No substitute ordinance, just a substitute narrative and substantive plans.

[Speaker 1] (1:07:07 - 1:07:23)
All right. Alderman Raboios moves to accept the substantive narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, the substitute narrative and plans are accepted and in front of us. So continue, Sarah.

[Speaker 3] (1:07:23 - 1:09:05)
Thank you so much. So we have been working with Alderman Martin's office once more, as well as his 47th Ward Zoning Advisory Committee. And too, we've had robust engagement with the North Center Neighborhood Association, as well as the Planning and Development Committee for the North Center Chamber of Commerce after many months of engagement with those groups and the residents of the neighborhood.

We came to the current programming that you have before you here today, which calls for the construction of a new four-story all residential building that will contain a total of 20 dwelling units. And due to its close proximity to the CTAL line, L station, excuse me, we will have onsite parking for 10 vehicles, which is about a 50% reduction in the required onsite parking. And too, as a result of this ongoing engagement with the community, we have made some design tweaks to the building, such as setting back on the front of the building five feet, as well as the sides of the buildings and to adding more two-bedroom and three-bedroom units to the building.

So towards that end, I am also happy to advise that the proposal will include four onsite affordable dwelling units that will be reflective of both the two-bedroom, three-bedroom and one-bedroom options. So it'll have a diverse mix of affordable units on site. With all of that, we do have a letter of support from Alderman Martin, as well as the North Center Neighborhood Association.

And we very respectfully request the support of this honorable committee.

[Speaker 1] (1:09:06 - 1:09:12)
Thank you, Sarah. For the record, the unit count went down from 22 to 20?

[Speaker 3] (1:09:13 - 1:09:14)
Yes, sir.

[Speaker 1] (1:09:14 - 1:09:17)
Okay, with the 20% onsite affordability.

[Speaker 3] (1:09:18 - 1:09:18)
That's correct.

[Speaker 1] (1:09:19 - 1:09:37)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Martin. Questions by committee members? No questions.

Can I get a motion to move to pass with the same roll call that was used to determine quorum with the substantive narrative and plans being accepted?

[Speaker 5] (1:09:38 - 1:09:40)
So moved by Alderman Cardona.

[Speaker 1] (1:09:40 - 1:09:50)
Alderman Cardona makes the motion. Any objection to his motion? Hearing none, the item is passed with the substantive narrative and plans.

All right, Sarah, have a good day.

[Speaker 3] (1:09:50 - 1:09:52)
You as well. Take care, be safe.

[Speaker 1] (1:09:53 - 1:10:00)
Now we're gonna, let me just, do we have Alderman Ramirez Rosa?

[Speaker 30] (1:10:01 - 1:10:01)
Present.

[Speaker 1] (1:10:02 - 1:10:32)
Okay, all right. Then we're gonna go back and look at your Aldermanic. Let me read it into the record, Carlos.

If this is on page two, document number A8724, 35th Ward, ordinance was referred on September 14th of 2021. Common address is 3335 West Fullerton Avenue in the change request. C12 Neighborhood Commercial District to B31 Community Shopping District.

Alderman Ramirez Rosa.

[Speaker 17] (1:10:33 - 1:11:24)
Thank you so much, Chairman and the committee for taking up this rezoning today. Our community partners in Logan Square that are part of my community-driven zoning and development process periodically assess the zoning of parcels and of stretches in the 35th Ward. They looked at Fullerton Avenue and they found that the C1-2 was an outlier.

So we worked with Steven Valenciano and with Patrick Murphy to look into the history of this. And we determined that this parcel should be rezoned to coincide with the rest of the district. So the rest of the district is B.

This is the outlier, that's C. And we want to rectify that to advance our land use and zoning policies in the 35th Ward. So I appreciate the committee support.

[Speaker 28] (1:11:25 - 1:11:25)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:11:26 - 1:11:44)
Thank you, Alderman. Questions for the Alderman? All right, hearing no questions or hands up, can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

Get a motion, please.

[Speaker 24] (1:11:45 - 1:11:46)
So moved, Cardona.

[Speaker 1] (1:11:47 - 1:11:57)
Alderman Cardona makes the motion. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Thank you, Alderman Ramirez Rosa.

[Speaker 23] (1:11:58 - 1:11:58)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:12:00 - 1:12:34)
Thank you. Okay, now we're back to the bottom of page four. And this item is number 20855 T1 in the 40th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on October 14th of 21. Common address is 4927 North Claremont Avenue. And the change request of an RS3 residential single unit detached house district, the B23 neighborhood mixed use district.

And we have Tom Moore on this.

[Speaker 14] (1:12:35 - 1:14:02)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. This is a old convent that's been empty for many years. And so the archdiocese has sold it to the applicant who hopes to renovate it into a 16 unit apartment building.

It's a beautiful building. And he's going to save it with no changes to the exterior except some squaring off of the attic to make some living room up there. It would be a T1 because it's near the Western Avenue.

And there's limited parking. But it would have affordable and it would preserve a beautiful building and make it into viable apartments to continue its use. And in order to do all that, it's an R3 right now.

We have to go to a B23, which would make it compliant zoning and allow the TOD T1. So we've been through a process in the 40th ward.

[Speaker 1] (1:14:03 - 1:14:06)
We have the community support and the alderman support.

[Speaker 14] (1:14:07 - 1:14:08)
And we'd request your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (1:14:09 - 1:14:12)
Mr. Moore, do we have a substitute on this T1?

[Speaker 14] (1:14:17 - 1:14:23)
I'm sorry. I'm not aware of that. It's a T1.

Correct.

[Speaker 1] (1:14:24 - 1:14:28)
All right. It's on our list as maybe a substitute.

[Speaker 25] (1:14:28 - 1:14:46)
Anna Robles from the department, please. Can you hear me, Chairman? We can.

Yes, we can. Anna Robles, you're a DPD. Mr. Moore, you did submit a substitute just recently.

[Speaker 14] (1:14:47 - 1:14:51)
Then I'm sorry. Excuse me. I'm sorry.

I didn't note that.

[Speaker 25] (1:14:51 - 1:14:57)
I don't see any changes to the narrative. I'm not sure if you made changes to the plans, but it was submitted as a substitute.

[Speaker 14] (1:14:58 - 1:15:19)
The only changes to the plans, I believe, were the squaring off of the showing the building basically is being preserved. It's a beautiful, classical building. And we're squaring off the third floor, the attic floor to make dwelling units there.

[Speaker 25] (1:15:20 - 1:15:21)
So the upper floor addition.

[Speaker 14] (1:15:21 - 1:15:22)
That's right.

[Speaker 25] (1:15:22 - 1:15:25)
Yes, it's a substitute, Chairman. Okay.

[Speaker 14] (1:15:25 - 1:15:27)
So I apologize for that.

[Speaker 25] (1:15:27 - 1:15:28)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (1:15:28 - 1:15:53)
With that, Alderman Cardona moves to accept the substantive plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to his motion? All right.

I'm hearing none. The substantive narrative plans are accepted. I think that basically is the end of your presentation, correct?

[Speaker 14] (1:15:53 - 1:15:53)
Yes, sir.

[Speaker 19] (1:15:54 - 1:15:55)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:15:56 - 1:16:10)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Vasquez. So I need a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum with the substantive narrative plans attached.

[Speaker 34] (1:16:10 - 1:16:11)
Riley so moves. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:16:13 - 1:17:27)
Alderman Riley makes the motion. Any objections to the motion? Hearing none, the item is passed for the substantive narrative and plans.

Now I heard Alderman Austin. Did I hear your voice here? Yes, sir.

Okay. So number one, you want to be added for purposes of the roll call, correct? Yes, sir.

And you do have an aldermanic on page two. Would you like it to be discussed right now? Yes, please.

Okay. Let me read it into the record. And by the way, we did have two or three public speakers on this concern about a towing company of sorts with a lot of reckless behavior.

So with that being said, I'm going to read this into the record. Aldermanic 8723 in the 34th ward. Ordinance was referred on September 14th of 2021.

The common address is 400 West 107th street. And the change requests from M11 limited manufacturing district to an RS2 residential single unit detached house district. Alderman Austin.

[Speaker 26] (1:17:30 - 1:18:17)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I was trying to get my notes on this address. Yes, there have been some difficulties with this particular address.

I just felt like the neighbors that were in the particular area are the ones that I needed to hear from opposed to those that, you know, reside further away. And that's the reason why I asked what to be held before. So, but they just came and made this their own towing company.

And I didn't, you know, without any license or anything. So if there is no objection, I would like for this to be held.

[Speaker 1] (1:18:20 - 1:18:38)
All right. So your request is to hold this in committee until date certain. Yes, sir.

All right. So on, can I get a motion to defer this item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 24] (1:18:39 - 1:18:40)
I'll move Alderman Cardona.

[Speaker 1] (1:18:41 - 1:19:06)
Alderman Cardona makes the motion to defer any objections. Hearing on the item is deferred. And all right.

So Alderman Austin, I just, I know our committee is going to forward whatever the public comment was on these and the residents. Yes. We'll make sure you get that in your office.

Okay.

[Speaker 26] (1:19:06 - 1:19:21)
Well, I appreciate that, you know, because you can't just come and just start a business because this vacant area, you know, it's like you have to have license and everything. And they did not do this. And my residents have been quite upset about it.

[Speaker 1] (1:19:22 - 1:20:33)
Well, their voice was articulated by, I think, three speakers of the five in the public comment period. So we'll get that information to you. So you can make sure that you're hearing from your constituents.

Thank you. Okay. While the Alderman we do have is Alderman Derek Curtis.

Derek? All right. When we hear from Alderman Curtis, we'll go back to him.

All right. Now we're moving to the top of page five. This item is number 20860, 38th Ward.

Ordinance was deferred on October 14th of 2021. Common address is 4149 North Austin Avenue. And the change request, RS3, Residential Single Unit Detached House District to an RT4, Residential Two-Flat Townhouse District.

[Speaker 16] (1:20:34 - 1:21:24)
And we do have Nick Fatikas. Nick? Good morning, Chairman.

Nick Fatikas for the record. I am here on behalf of Iwa Petroska, the owner of the property at 4149 North Austin. The subject property is improved with an existing two-story multi-unit building.

There seems to be a discrepancy with the building permit history for the number of units. The building has three existing units. Only two are shown as being permitted.

So the zoning change is required to bring that third unit into full compliance with both the Chicago zoning ordinance and building code. We have worked with Alderman Sposato on this change. And I believe a letter of support was already provided to your office.

Again, there's no change to the physical building. This is a permitting issue within the building.

[Speaker 1] (1:21:26 - 1:21:32)
Nick, we do have a letter of support from Alderman Sposato. And this is not an ADU area.

[Speaker 16] (1:21:33 - 1:21:39)
Unfortunately, we're outside the ADU boundary, which is why the zoning change is required in this case.

[Speaker 19] (1:21:39 - 1:21:39)
Great.

[Speaker 16] (1:21:40 - 1:21:45)
All right. Questions from committee members?

[Speaker 1] (1:21:46 - 1:21:53)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Sposato. Can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 26] (1:21:54 - 1:21:55)
Move to pass, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:21:55 - 1:22:12)
That is Alderman Dowell makes the motion. Any objections to her motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

All right. Next, I'm going to read into the record, but my office tells me that we are going to have a deferral on this.

[Speaker 16] (1:22:13 - 1:22:18)
Yes, Chairman. Item 20864 in the 27th ward.

[Speaker 1] (1:22:19 - 1:22:47)
All right, well, let me read it in the record and get a motion to defer. Okay. All right.

Item number 20864, 27th ward ordinance was deferred on October 14th of 2021. Common address is 512 through 528 South California Avenue and the change request from B23 neighborhood mixed use district to C11 neighborhood commercial district. Um, so, uh, Nick, uh, is the Alderman making the motion or are you making a motion or what?

[Speaker 16] (1:22:47 - 1:22:53)
Uh, either, uh, I it's we can make the motion, uh, on agreement. Yes. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:22:53 - 1:23:06)
So that motion is made by the attorney. The request. Let's get to Alderman Burnett.

Yeah. Alderman.

[Speaker 2] (1:23:08 - 1:23:14)
We hadn't had a community meeting with community about this. So that's why we're deferring it. So I appreciate the committee support on that.

[Speaker 34] (1:23:16 - 1:23:16)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (1:23:18 - 1:24:08)
So we have a motion to defer. Yeah, Alderman Burnett is making the motion to defer. Any objections to the motion?

Hearing none. Um, this item is being deferred. All right.

All right. Next, bottom of page five, number 20857 T1 in the eighth ward ordinance was referred on October 14th of 2021. Common address 823 through 833 East 87th street.

The change request B32 community shopping district and RS3 residential single unit district all to a B32 community shopping district. Nick, you're on this one in the eighth ward.

[Speaker 16] (1:24:08 - 1:25:04)
Yes. Thank you, chairman. Again, Nick fatigue is for the record.

I'm here on behalf of the property owner, Jackie Jackson, birthrights incorporated. The subject property contains 21,907 square feet of total lot area. It's currently improved with what used to be a bank building.

The owner is proposing to adapt and reuse the building and establish a fat burger restaurant at the site. We found out through zoning review that a portion of the site is zoned R3. So the zoning changes to create a uniform underlining zoning district of B3-2.

So we can move forward with the restaurant adaptive reuse for the restaurant. We have worked with Alderman Harris, and I believe we had an email. I sent an email confirming the Alderman support for the zoning change to staff.

And I'd be happy to answer any questions you or the committee members have about this project. All right.

[Speaker 1] (1:25:04 - 1:25:10)
Well, we do have a letter of support from Alderman Harris. And the name of the restaurant again?

[Speaker 16] (1:25:10 - 1:25:11)
A fat burger.

[Speaker 1] (1:25:13 - 1:25:14)
Really? Yeah.

[Speaker 16] (1:25:15 - 1:25:16)
Well, that's a good thing or a bad thing, right?

[Speaker 1] (1:25:17 - 1:25:38)
I'll let Alderman Cardona seems to get a kick out of that one. All right. Any questions, comments?

Alderman Pat Dowell. Moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to her motion?

Hearing none, the item is passed.

[Speaker 16] (1:25:38 - 1:25:39)
Thank you so much.

[Speaker 1] (1:25:40 - 1:26:00)
All right. Before we get to the next witness, do we have Derek Curtis, Alderman Curtis. Vernon Wilson for Alderman Curtis.

All right. Are you ready to discuss his Aldermanic ordinance?

[Speaker 23] (1:26:02 - 1:26:05)
Yes. Basically it's the- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

[Speaker 1] (1:26:05 - 1:26:50)
Let me read it into the record. Okay. Because initially we didn't have him on board.

All right. All right. So folks on the committee, we're going back to page two.

The item in the 18th ward, that's number A8722. The ordinance was referred on September 14th of 21. The common address 2850 West Columbus Avenue.

The change request, manufacturing plan development number 776 as amended to manufacturing plan development number 776 as amended again, I presume. All right. So for the record, identify yourself on behalf of Alderman Curtis, please.

[Speaker 23] (1:26:50 - 1:26:53)
Vernon Wilson on behalf of Alderman Curtis.

[Speaker 1] (1:26:53 - 1:26:56)
All right. Vernon, let's talk about Columbus Avenue.

[Speaker 23] (1:26:59 - 1:27:18)
Basically, it was purchased, one parcel of that land was purchased by another entity and they want to basically re-designate as their own separate plan development for manufacturing.

[Speaker 1] (1:27:21 - 1:27:34)
Okay. Let me just, let me try to clarify what I'm being asked to do. I'm being asked to do this on behalf of the committee members.

So this is an existing plan development, if I'm not mistaken.

[Speaker 34] (1:27:35 - 1:27:35)
Correct.

[Speaker 1] (1:27:36 - 1:27:51)
And we're amending it to do what? We're amending it to- All right. Patrick, do you want to help our person from the 18th ward?

[Speaker 34] (1:27:53 - 1:27:53)
Yes.

[Speaker 20] (1:27:54 - 1:28:36)
There are two actions for this property, Alderman. One is, Chairman, one is being done by Alderman Curtis, which is amending the existing plan development. Separately, there is a private application for a new plan development of which will be adjacent and they're sharing access.

So this aldermanic action is designed to address a PD that exists and a boundary issue that came up because of a shared roadway. There is a separate and later private application that is being done by a separate applicant, not the alderman, to address the new proposed work outside of the existing PD, which in itself triggers its own PD.

[Speaker 1] (1:28:37 - 1:28:47)
Okay. All right. Well, that makes sense.

Our representative from the 18th ward, is that the legalese that the alderman would like to achieve?

[Speaker 29] (1:28:48 - 1:28:49)
Yes, that is.

[Speaker 1] (1:28:49 - 1:29:25)
Okay. All right. With that explanation, do we have questions?

We have hands up on this one. I don't see any hands up. Any questions by committee members on this aldermanic?

Hearing none, can I get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderman Lopez makes the motion. Any objections to his motion?

Hearing none, this item is passed. Thank you very much.

[Speaker 6] (1:29:25 - 1:29:25)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:29:25 - 1:29:29)
All right. Do we have any other alder persons on?

[Speaker 25] (1:29:40 - 1:29:40)
Chairman.

[Speaker 34] (1:29:42 - 1:29:43)
All right, Anna.

[Speaker 25] (1:29:44 - 1:29:55)
Yeah, the one that was just passed on Columbus. I don't know if, did we, it went to plan commission, Chicago plan commission. Was that in the record?

[Speaker 1] (1:29:57 - 1:31:32)
Okay. No, we did not incorporate the records. So I'm going to have to go back to that item in the 18th for the aldermanic application.

A8722 on 2850 West Columbus. So I need a motion first to incorporate the records from the plan commission with the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Alderman Lopez makes the motion.

The records are incorporated. And now I need a motion to move do pass on the item. All right.

Alderman Lopez makes motion to pass as revised. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none.

Again, this item is passed as revised. Thank you. Thank you, Raymond.

All right. Now we're back to 34. Okay.

We'll move on. Now we're top of page six committee members. Item number 20848 T1 in the 34th ward ordinance was referred on October 14th of 21.

And the common address is 501 through 517 West 119th street. Change request. B11 neighborhood shopping district.

B23 neighborhood mixed use district. Andrew Scott.

[Speaker 4] (1:31:32 - 1:32:21)
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. For the record, Andrew Scott with the law offices of Dykema Gossett. I'm here on behalf of the applicant West Pullman Apartments LLC.

Mr. Chairman, this is about a 19,000 square foot vacant site. It's actually owned by the city. But my client, the developer has a agreement with the city to purchase this land.

As you had mentioned, they want to rezone it from B11 to B23. This is a type one rezoning. This will pave the way for a 36 unit affordable housing project with 18 parking spaces.

We have spoken with with Alderman Austin, and I believe you should have a letter of support on file with your office. And I actually I think I saw the Alderman on as well. So available to answer questions.

[Speaker 1] (1:32:21 - 1:32:34)
We do have a lot of support from Alderwoman Austin. You ready? Alderman Austin, are you here?

You want to talk about this project on West 119, please?

[Speaker 26] (1:32:34 - 1:33:00)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think that I have been really blessed because we needed housing so badly. And to have these many units that will be developed in the ward is just, you know, a godsend for me.

I wish we could have tripled that amount. But I'm grateful for the project that we do have now. And I'm asking my colleagues to please support this project for us.

[Speaker 1] (1:33:01 - 1:33:06)
Thank you. Thank you, Alderwoman. Any questions for the applicant or the Alderman?

[Speaker 18] (1:33:08 - 1:33:09)
Move do pass, Chairman.

[Speaker 17] (1:33:09 - 1:33:10)
Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 1] (1:33:10 - 1:33:23)
All right. I don't see any hands up. Alderman Ray Lopez makes the motion.

Move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine form. Any objections to his motion? Hearing on the item is passed.

[Speaker 15] (1:33:24 - 1:33:25)
Thank you very much, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:33:25 - 1:33:26)
Congratulations.

[Speaker 15] (1:33:26 - 1:33:27)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:33:27 - 1:33:50)
Middle of page six. Number 20845, 31st Ward. Ordinance was referred on October 14th of 2021.

Common address is 3108 to 3112 North Central Avenue. And the change request. B11 Neighborhood Shopping District to C11 Neighborhood Commercial District.

We have Mark Kupiec.

[Speaker 22] (1:33:51 - 1:35:03)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. Almost Mark Kupiec. I am an attorney from the office of Mark Kupiec.

My name is Agnes Flajka. And I'm here on behalf of the applicant, Eat Clean Chicago LLC. It is a very young, exciting company.

They provide catering and meal prepping since 2015 to many communities within the city. And their philosophy is to simplify nutrition to help busy people live a healthy life by providing well-balanced, nutritious meals. They actually have an existing location at 4930 South Cicero Avenue, which they outgrew.

They are hoping to get a bigger kitchen as their clientele grows. So this subject property at 3108-12 will provide them opportunity for a bigger kitchen and just an opportunity to grow. Alderman Cardona was kind enough to organize a wonderful community meeting.

We presented this project to the community. We received their support. And we are asking for your support as well.

I believe Alderman Cardona is on the call. And we would love to hear from him as well.

[Speaker 1] (1:35:05 - 1:35:11)
Thank you, Agnes. All right, Alderman Cardona on the Belmont Central.

[Speaker 24] (1:35:12 - 1:35:37)
Thank you, Chairman. This is a great necessity within the neighborhood. We had a community meeting.

Residents was addressed with their issues and concerns. And Jesus, the owner of Eat Clean, addressed those issues. And they're very supportive.

So from there, I look for your support and my colleagues' support on the zoning change.

[Speaker 1] (1:35:39 - 1:36:09)
Thank you, Alderman. Sounds like from the presentation, this is a health concept and delivery and catering and such. So obviously, that's important to all sides of the city.

But I'm sure it's especially important to you in the 31st Ward. Questions from committee members? Can I get a motion to move to pass by the same time?

Oh, I'm sorry. Alderman Lopez, Raymond.

[Speaker 17] (1:36:10 - 1:36:14)
Thank you, Chairman. Are they leaving the location on South Cicero Avenue completely?

[Speaker 22] (1:36:15 - 1:36:18)
That's my belief, yes. Thank you, Alderman, for that question.

[Speaker 17] (1:36:19 - 1:36:22)
They were there for quite some time down there, correct?

[Speaker 22] (1:36:22 - 1:36:55)
Yeah, I believe they actually started since 2015. The space is just not big enough. There's just no room to expand anywhere.

So this existing location, actually, it had been a restaurant and a banquet hall for 30 plus years. So everything is already in that property, in the building. It's a one-story existing commercial building.

They're not looking to make any additions, so the exterior will stay the same. But they are hoping to expand kitchen in that building and just basically re-establish that use that had been there for many, many years.

[Speaker 17] (1:36:56 - 1:37:04)
Well, I guess I can support Alderman Cardona stealing businesses from the southwest side and taking them to the northwest side. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 24] (1:37:06 - 1:37:07)
Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (1:37:07 - 1:37:21)
All right, I'm not going to get between the two of you. Okay. But it sounds like my staff tells me it's a pretty successful concept, three meals a day for five days a week, that kind of concept?

[Speaker 22] (1:37:22 - 1:37:24)
And that is correct, yes.

[Speaker 1] (1:37:24 - 1:37:24)
Yes.

[Speaker 22] (1:37:25 - 1:37:30)
All right. I can testify. I tried their food and it's absolutely delicious.

[Speaker 1] (1:37:30 - 1:37:51)
Great. All right. Well, I'm sorry to see a full-service restaurant morph into this, but that's the nature of where we're at today.

So, all right, thank you. And did we make the motion? Oh, then Alderman Ray Lopez makes the motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used in the determined quorum.

[Speaker 17] (1:37:52 - 1:37:53)
Yes, yes.

[Speaker 1] (1:37:54 - 1:38:27)
All right. Any objections to the motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Thank you very much. Now we're in the bottom of page six. Document number 20861, 29th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on October 14th of 2021. Common address is 7150 through 7160 West Grand Avenue. And the change request, B12, Neighborhood Shopping District to C22, Motor Vehicle Related Commercial District.

Joe Gattuso. Gattuso, Joe?

[Speaker 29] (1:38:28 - 1:39:15)
Yes. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. Joseph P.

Gattuso, the law firm of Taft, Stettinius, and Hollister, appearing this morning on behalf of the applicant in this matter, GLNY LLC. This is an application to reclassify the property located at 7150 to 60 West Grand Avenue as a C2-2 Motor Vehicle Related Commercial District instead of a B1-2 Neighborhood Shopping District. This will allow, if approved, the applicant to proceed and request special use approval to establish a cannabis craft grower establishment and facility at this site.

We have vetted this matter with Alderman Taliaferro, and I believe he was kind enough to submit a letter of support, which I believe the committee has.

[Speaker 1] (1:39:17 - 1:39:21)
We do have the support of Alderman Taliaferro.

[Speaker 29] (1:39:23 - 1:39:45)
And of course, we are grateful for that. So with that, Mr. Chairman, that is the proposal. Obviously, the matter will be placed before the community fully in the context of the special use request.

But of course, one cannot obtain a denial to proceed before the Zoning Board of Appeals without this reclassification. So we would be grateful for the committee's support.

[Speaker 1] (1:39:46 - 1:39:56)
Thank you very much. Questions by committee members? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 30] (1:39:57 - 1:39:59)
Move to pass Alderman Wagesbeck.

[Speaker 1] (1:39:59 - 1:40:05)
Alderman Wagesbeck makes the motion. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

[Speaker 29] (1:40:06 - 1:40:10)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, and everyone have a wonderful holiday.

[Speaker 1] (1:40:13 - 1:40:44)
Thank you, Joe. All right, top of page seven. Document number 20858 in the 26th ward.

Ordinance was referred on October 14th of 2021. Common address is 820 North California Avenue. And the change request from a C12 neighborhood commercial district to B23 neighborhood mixed use district.

John Fritsche. John?

[Speaker 34] (1:40:56 - 1:40:57)
Do you hear me now?

[Speaker 1] (1:40:58 - 1:41:19)
Yeah, John, we have a slight technical difficulty with the streaming. So give us a minute so our technical folks can get us back streaming. No worries.

Hold on for hopefully just a short few minutes. Committee members, we're going to have a little bit of a break here while we get our technical house in order.

[Speaker 26] (1:42:49 - 1:42:52)
Mr. Chairman, is somebody talking?

[Speaker 1] (1:43:03 - 1:43:10)
Carrie, we have some technical difficulties on the streaming. So we're on a short, hopefully short break.

[Speaker 26] (1:43:10 - 1:43:11)
All right, then. Thank you, sir.

[Speaker 1] (1:48:49 - 2:02:59)
I'm still working on it, committee members. So please stay tuned. If I had, I'd deliver cinnamon rolls to you.

But I can't do that right now. I'm at City Hall. All right, we have some technical difficulties.

It's going to take a few more minutes. So I'm going to recess meeting until noon. So hopefully you can get a bite to eat.

And we'll be back in hopefully about five, seven minutes. Okay, thank you. Unfortunately, committee members, we're still having problems.

So we're going to recess this meeting until 1230. And hopefully we'll have Mr. Pritchett come back and talk about the application. All right.

[Speaker 6] (2:02:59 - 2:03:16)
Chairman, this is tech support. I've contacted our live streaming servers, the company, and they have some kind of outage over there. And so they're working on, you know, they say they don't know when, but I'm checking with them every minute.

[Speaker 1] (2:03:17 - 2:03:31)
All right, well, we'll touch base, committee members, and try to resume the meeting at 1230. So please grab a bite to eat and come back refreshed because we're only halfway through. Thank you.

[Speaker 34] (2:29:36 - 2:29:39)
Chairman, this is tech support. We are good to go.

The rezoning is sought for use purposes only specifically to allow for ground floor residential use the existing use the existing commercial spaces have been vacant for quite some time. We discussed this with Alderman Maldonado, and we agreed that the reuse would be in the best interest of the community.

[Speaker 12] (2:35:20 - 2:36:19)
Continue Tom. Before you this afternoon, seeking an amendment of the zoning map from the current m 11 to that of a C to two for the property commonly known as 4014 West Parker Avenue. It is currently improved with a two story industrial building, whose most recent use has been ground floor storage and residential on the second floor.

The applicant seeks to renovate that building. While continuing this traditional use, he will use the residential unit on the second floor for the as the home for his family, and the ground floor will be his workshop and storage. We have reviewed plans with Alderman Cardona who has provided a letter of support who is actually here today.

So I won't, I won't speak for him. And we did hold a community meeting on this matter, where no objections were voiced. So, therefore, we would ask the committee to recommend passage of the application to the full city council.

[Speaker 1] (2:36:20 - 2:36:35)
Thank you, Tom. We have Alderman Cardona on the call. Felix, do you want to talk about this item on Parker Avenue.

Alderman Cardona.

[Speaker 24] (2:36:37 - 2:37:17)
All right, well, I'm here. I'm sorry I had you on mute. I'm sorry chairman, but I had you on mute.

So we had a community meeting. I support this change regarding this building. The family is gonna redo the second floor for living space for them and then use the first floor for his workshop.

We're down zoning so the M1 and we're down zoning it so we could accommodate the family and his, his shop. And I look for your favorable consideration on this matter. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:37:17 - 2:37:23)
Thank you, Alderman. So we're going from M11 to C22, is that correct?

[Speaker 24] (2:37:24 - 2:37:24)
Correct. Yes.

[Speaker 1] (2:37:25 - 2:37:39)
Okay, great. Any questions for the Alderman or the applicant? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine form with the substantive narrative and plans?

[Speaker 25] (2:37:39 - 2:37:40)
Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:37:41 - 2:37:43)
Is that, Anna Robles, yes?

[Speaker 25] (2:37:43 - 2:37:58)
Yes, it is. Afternoon. Anna Robles, a DPD.

I just noticed in Tom's ordinance, there's a typo. M-1, it's not M1-1. So if we can correct that with a substitute.

[Speaker 1] (2:38:00 - 2:38:12)
All right. So the, the change request, Anna, should be just M1? Well, it shows M1.

Oh, the existing. M1 is the existing.

[Speaker 25] (2:38:13 - 2:38:21)
Yes, M1 instead of M1-2, which is the, which is the district.

[Speaker 1] (2:38:22 - 2:38:26)
So currently, Anna, it's M12. Is that what you're saying?

[Speaker 25] (2:38:27 - 2:38:27)
Correct.

[Speaker 1] (2:38:28 - 2:38:33)
Okay. So for the record, do we need to, do we need to substitute?

[Speaker 25] (2:38:34 - 2:38:39)
What do we need? Yes, we need a substitute to correct that typo.

[Speaker 23] (2:38:39 - 2:38:50)
Okay. This is Mark Siegel from the Corporation Council's office. You can do it just as an amendment, I think, because it's a very minor change.

Do you want to amend it in the face?

[Speaker 1] (2:38:50 - 2:39:12)
All right. So I will take that prerogative, I should say. And we are changing the change request to, from M1-2 to M1-1.

And the change from M1-1 to C2-2. Is that correct, Mr. Siegel?

[Speaker 10] (2:39:14 - 2:39:27)
Yes, if that's the correct change. I'm not familiar with the specific change in this issue. But yes, if you want to change it specifically on the face, a motion can be made to amend, to make the amendment before the body.

[Speaker 1] (2:39:28 - 2:39:40)
Okay. So I'm asking for a motion to amend the original application at M1-2. And I'm asking for a motion to move that down to M1-1.

[Speaker 30] (2:39:41 - 2:39:44)
Chairman, I make the motion to move it to M1-1. This is Alderman Wagesbeck.

[Speaker 1] (2:39:45 - 2:40:21)
Any objections to the motion? Hearing none, that typo is corrected. Now, on the motion from M1-1 to C2-2.

Alderman Wagesbeck makes the motion to accept that with the substantive narrative plans. Is that right? Yes.

Scott makes the motion. Any objections to that motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Mr. Pekarski, you look perplexed.

[Speaker 12] (2:40:22 - 2:40:32)
No, no, no. I unfortunately, I have two screens. So I'm looking at you on one and the camera's over here.

Okay. I'm fully on board with this.

[Speaker 1] (2:40:32 - 2:40:35)
Okay. So we're good to go. Thank you.

Thank you, Alderman Cardona.

[Speaker 12] (2:40:36 - 2:40:37)
Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:40:37 - 2:41:01)
Now we're in the middle of page eight. Document number 20846-T1, 25th Ward. Ordinance was referred on October 14th of 21.

Common address, 554 West Cullerton Street. Change request, M23 Light Industry District to B2-2 Neighborhood Mixed Use District. We have Rolando Acosta.

[Speaker 4] (2:41:03 - 2:42:17)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant. The matter before you involves a 2400 square foot parcel on West Cullerton Street that is currently zoned M23, but it has historically been improved with a two unit residential building.

The current owner purchased the property back in 2002, was in the midst of rehabbing the unit that needed some significant work. In that process, discovered that the foundations were faulty, sought to repair the foundations. There was then a wind event back in August of 2020.

You'll all recall the derecho that occurred. That buckled the main spine to the roof and a portion of the building had to be demolished for safety reasons. As a result, reestablishing the two unit building that was once there requires us to amend the zoning to a B2-2 so that it's authorized in that district.

We have met with the Alderman, the community is supportive of this, and I know that Alderman Sitio Lopez is on the call, or at least he appears to be on the call, to state his position.

[Speaker 1] (2:42:19 - 2:42:24)
Thank you, Rolando. Alderman Sitio Lopez on this item on Cullerton.

[Speaker 13] (2:42:25 - 2:42:38)
Thank you, Chairman. Yes, indeed, the applicant met with our zoning advisory board and fulfills the expectations and commitments that the zoning advisory board has put forward.

[Speaker 26] (2:42:38 - 2:42:42)
So we're in support and we ask our colleagues for a favorable vote on this item.

[Speaker 1] (2:42:45 - 2:44:01)
Thank you, Alderman. Questions for the Alderman or the applicant? Hearing none, can I get a motion moved to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine- So moved, Mr. Chairman. Alderman Austin. Alderman Austin makes the motion. Any objections to her motion?

Hearing none, the item is passed. Next, bottom of page eight, document number 2071018-4, ordinance was referred on May 26th of 21, common address 3100 West 77th Street and 7600 South Kedzie. The change request, plan development number 776 and M22, light industry district, to M22 light industry district, and then to a plan development plan.

For the benefit of our committee members, this is adjacent to the item that we passed the Aldermanic. We passed for Alderman Derek Curtis and then we had to subdivide that as Patrick Murphy said, to accommodate this private application by Rolando. So these are basically the same area and then subdividing to a new PD.

Is that correct, Rolando?

[Speaker 4] (2:44:02 - 2:44:05)
That is correct. This is the companion to that application by the Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (2:44:06 - 2:44:07)
Okay, would you present it to the committee?

[Speaker 4] (2:44:07 - 2:45:49)
Sure. Once again, Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant. Good afternoon.

This is, as we just stated, the companion and really brings back into a plan development, the property that was excluded from plan development 776 pursuant to Alderman Curtis' ordinance. It also adds an approximately nine acre parcel on the west side of Kedzie Boulevard at 76th Street. This whole application and project is being driven by an effort to rectify a traffic situation that's occurring.

The current operations are a container storage area. There's a series of large trucks that access the property on a daily basis. They mostly come from the south and their exiting requires them from the east side of Kedzie, requires them to make a left turn on Kedzie, blocking Kedzie traffic.

By adding the parcel to the west, we'll be able to have ingress coming by right turns from Kedzie headed east. And then they will access the new property on the west side of Kedzie through a pathway under the Kedzie bridge that surmounts the railroad tracks at that location. And then they can also exit by making right turns from the west side and simplifying the traffic configuration and hopefully resolving the problem.

We have worked extensively with CDOT on this matter and they have concurred with this design and approach. This matter was before the Chicago Plan Commission on October 21st, 2021. And I would ask the committee incorporate the records of that proceeding into the records of this proceeding.

[Speaker 1] (2:45:49 - 2:46:29)
And with that, I'm happy to answer any questions you may have. Thank you, Rolando. So first, Alderman Hopkins moves to incorporate the records from the Plan Commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections to that? Hearing none, the records are incorporated. And on the motion, or I'm sorry, we do have a letter of support from Alderman Curtis.

Questions by committee members? Rolando, I have a quick question. I'm a little familiar with this area.

You're talking about the viaduct at 79th and Kedzie?

[Speaker 4] (2:46:30 - 2:46:53)
Yes, there's a viaduct at 79th and Kedzie. We will be sliding under that viaduct. So we'll access the parcel from the east to the west are connected under the viaduct.

Well, you know that viaduct always floods, you know that. Yeah, there's major repairs being done as well as stormwater management and increased landscaping. So we've also gone through stormwater management for all of us.

[Speaker 1] (2:46:54 - 2:47:02)
Okay, that's it for me. Any questions from committee members? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call?

[Speaker 7] (2:47:02 - 2:47:04)
Move do pass, Mr. Chairman, Alderman Dowell.

[Speaker 1] (2:47:04 - 2:48:02)
Alderman Dowell makes the motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum with the records from Plan Commission incorporated. Any objections to that? Hearing none, this item will be passed as revised.

And make sure that place doesn't flood. I grew up about a block away from there. I know that area very, very well.

So, all right. Okay, next. Top of page nine, document number 20819 in the 17th ward ordinance was referred on September 14th of 21.

Common address is 1414 through 1416, West 69th Street. And the change request, RS3, residential single unit detached house district to B31 community shopping district. Rolando.

[Speaker 4] (2:48:04 - 2:49:08)
Good again, once again, good afternoon, Chairman, members of the committee. Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant. We actually have submitted, Mr. Chairman, a substitute ordinance that makes the change request to a B32 district. It was separately noticed by the committee as well as our office. It should be before you. We have also converted this from a non-type one to a type one application and submitted narrative and plans.

The existing property, the property is currently improved with a two-story underutilized, mostly vacant building. The applicant has purchased the property, wants to rehabilitate it and build an addition to the rear to provide a cafe on the front of the first floor and then office space to be used sort of as co-working space in the community. And for that purpose, we are seeking the rezoning.

I know that we've worked extensively with Alderman Moore, who I believe is supportive of this matter. I know he was here earlier, but I don't see him currently on the screen.

[Speaker 17] (2:49:09 - 2:49:14)
Happy to answer any questions. I move to accept the substitute before you.

[Speaker 1] (2:49:15 - 2:50:04)
Okay, so Alderman Roboyas moves to amend the application to a type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that motion? All right, hearing none, the item is amended to type one.

And on the motion, do we have Alderman Moore on the call? Do we have a... Yes.

Okay, so staff tells me that we have the support of Alderman Moore on the application. I think you mentioned that too, Rolando, did you not? I did.

Okay. All right, questions, comments from committee? Hearing none, can I get a motion moved to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum, noting that this is amended type one application?

[Speaker 26] (2:50:05 - 2:50:06)
So moved.

[Speaker 1] (2:50:07 - 2:50:21)
Alderman Kerry Austin makes the motion. Any questions on the motion? Hearing none or no objections, this item is passed as amended to type one.

[Speaker 34] (2:50:22 - 2:50:23)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:50:23 - 2:50:26)
All right, now we're in the middle of page nine.

[Speaker 34] (2:50:28 - 2:50:28)
I'm sorry.

[Speaker 25] (2:50:29 - 2:50:31)
Oh, let me just see.

[Speaker 1] (2:50:31 - 2:50:34)
Anna, well, you're on the call today, Anna.

[Speaker 25] (2:50:38 - 2:50:46)
Sorry, chairman, thank you. Just to make sure that it's also a substitute ordinance, not only a amended type one.

[Speaker 1] (2:50:47 - 2:51:00)
Okay, so with that- Substituting the district. All right, I'll call the motion back up. It is Alderman Pat Dow made the motion, correct?

[Speaker 30] (2:51:01 - 2:51:02)
Alderman Austin.

[Speaker 1] (2:51:03 - 2:51:26)
Oh, Alderman Austin, okay. So Alderman Austin makes the motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum, noting that this item is passed as amended to type one and the substitute that was accepted. Is that correct, Anna?

[Speaker 25] (2:51:27 - 2:51:32)
Right, the substitute ordinance from an RS3 to a B3-2.

[Speaker 1] (2:51:35 - 2:52:16)
Okay, all right. So hold on a second. Anna, clarify, I'm gonna ask for a substitute from the zoning, from what zoning to what, please?

[Speaker 4] (2:52:25 - 2:52:38)
I can do that if you'd like, Mr. Chairman. All right, let's hope that we get it right this time. Rolando?

It is currently an RS3 and the substitute changes the zoning to a B3-2.

[Speaker 6] (2:52:39 - 2:52:46)
So, I mean, just explain to them that they originally did from- Yeah, on your meeting.

[Speaker 4] (2:52:48 - 2:52:59)
It was originally filed as a B3-1 and the substitute is for a B3-2, having separately noticed the substitute because the increase in density.

[Speaker 15] (2:53:00 - 2:53:02)
We published the substitute.

[Speaker 1] (2:53:03 - 2:54:42)
Okay, so we did publish it correctly, but we still need the substitute from the RS3 to a B3-2 in regards to this application. So I'm gonna ask all the women, Austin, who is the substitute from an RS3 to a B3-2 by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that?

Hearing none, that substitute is before us. And now we need the motion by Alderwoman Carrie Austin by the same roll call to move the ordinance forward as substitute that we just discussed. So moved by Carrie, any objections?

Hearing none, the item is passed as substituted. And amended to type one. Thank you.

No, thank you, Rolando. All right, middle of page nine, document number 20856-T1, second ward. Ordinance was referred on October 14th of 21.

This common address, 1545 West Thomas Street and the change request RS3, residential single unit detached house district to an RM4.5 residential multi-unit district. Dan Lauer will be the attorney on this case. Dan.

[Speaker 28] (2:54:43 - 2:55:51)
Good afternoon, Chairman Tony. Hope you can hear me. We can.

1545 Thomas, number 20856-T1. There's no substitute at all, Mr. Chairman. I represent EZMB, which is now the owner.

The site is 24 feet by 124. The proposal is RS3 to 4.5, RM4.5 to construct a new three unit building in place of the existing three unit building. Echo Park Community Council has approved the proposal.

The building will look for all purposes as an RT4 building. The height is under 38 feet, but the FAR is 1.43 just to allow a usable third bedroom in the units, which will allow for long-term residents, families to live there long-term, et cetera, et cetera. We have a letter of support.

I'm happy to say from Alderman Hopkins. I'd like to say thanks to Brian Pellerin from the second ward and of course, to Alderman Brian Hopkins.

[Speaker 34] (2:55:53 - 2:55:54)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (2:55:55 - 2:56:02)
Alderman Hopkins, are you on the call or staff from second ward, please?

[Speaker 10] (2:56:03 - 2:56:04)
Staff is here.

[Speaker 1] (2:56:04 - 2:56:09)
All right. Identify yourself for the record and can you comment on the West Thomas application?

[Speaker 6] (2:56:10 - 2:56:40)
Yes, this is Brian Pellerin from second ward staff for the record. Yes, Alderman Hopkins is fully in support of this project. This is a situation where, as I believe Mr. Lauer already said, you know, the buildings on both sides of this building have been up-zoned and are considerably taller than this older property that's right there. It seems like a good move and was supported by the community organization. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:56:42 - 2:57:09)
Thank you. Questions from the committee, for the applicant or the Alderman's office? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

Alderman Siccio-Lopez makes that motion and he opposed to his motion. Hearing none, the item is passed. Thank you, Dan.

[Speaker 34] (2:57:10 - 2:57:11)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:57:14 - 2:57:39)

Also 1637-49 West Albion Avenue. Change request from B3-2 Community Shopping District to B3-5 Community Shopping District. Mike Esgar, please.

Mr. Chairman, I'll be replacing Mr. Esgar on this. Okay. Rolando then, proceed.

[Speaker 4] (2:59:36 - 2:59:54)
Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant. First of all, Mr. Chairman, to try to simplify it, we have a substitute ordinance which reduces the area of the property, deleting a parcel from the rezoning. And we also have substitute narrative and plans corresponding to the change.

[Speaker 1] (2:59:54 - 2:59:56)
All right. So the proposal will need two motions.

[Speaker 4] (2:59:57 - 3:00:00)
Number one- Move to accept the substitute before you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (3:00:00 - 3:00:35)
Vice Chairman Roboyas moves to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to moving that? Hearing none, the substitute is before us.

Now, Alderman Roboyas makes the motion to accept the substitute narrative plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. And any objections to that? So hearing none, the substitute narrative plans are accepted.

So we've got, I think, all in order to proceed.

[Speaker 4] (3:00:37 - 3:01:49)
This property is at the southwest corner of Clark and Albion, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. It is currently used as parking for taxi cabs. The proposal is to demolish the existing building and construct a four-story building that will contain residential storage units on the upper floors, parking and commercial space on the ground floor.

Commercial space along Clark Street, as well as turning the corner on Albion. It has gone through an extensive community process under Alderman Vasquez's guidance. We have received the support of the Rogers Park Business Alliance.

We've also received the support of Alderman Vasquez. I believe he has provided the committee with a letter substating. He has stated two conditions on that letter.

One, that we build in accordance with the type one plans that have been submitted. And we have every intention of doing so. And secondly, that after permits are received, that this be down-zoned back to the B3-2 district.

And we're also in concurrence with that. With that, Mr. Chairman, we will be happy to answer any questions the committee may have.

[Speaker 1] (3:01:51 - 3:02:20)
Thank you, Rolando. Any questions from committee members? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum, knowing that it was substituted.

And also the T1 was passed with narrative plans and change. So we've got two of this, the substitute and the type one narrative. So who made the motion?

[Speaker 34] (3:02:21 - 3:02:22)
Alderman Ravoyos.

[Speaker 1] (3:02:23 - 3:03:26)
Vice-chair Ravoyos makes the motion and he opposed to his motion. So hearing none, this item is passed. As with the substitute and the substantive narrative and plans.

Thank you. Have a good afternoon. Thank you very much.

All right, moving on to the middle of page 10, document number 20712 in the 27th ward. The ordinance was referred on May 26th of 21. Common address was 400 North Elizabeth.

The change request C3-3, commercial manufacturing employment district to DX5, downtown mixed use district, and then to a business plan development. For purposes of the people on the call, I think there were a couple of speakers that spoke in opposition to this. And then in the packet, there was also some letters of opposition.

Any letters of support?

[Speaker 9] (3:03:27 - 3:03:29)
No letter of support and the opposition was sent.

[Speaker 1] (3:03:29 - 3:03:42)
All right. And the written testimony was sent electronically yesterday to committee members. So with that, Rich Clowder will make the presentation.

[Speaker 5] (3:03:43 - 3:04:07)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Rich Clowder. I'm with the law firm of DLA Piper.

I represent the applicant, Mark Goodman and associates. As a preliminary matter, as you mentioned, I believe this application was considered and recommended for approval at the October 21st, 2021 plan commission hearing. And we would request that the transcript from that hearing be incorporated into the record here.

[Speaker 30] (3:04:10 - 3:04:14)
Chairman, I'll make a motion to accept those records into the committee.

[Speaker 1] (3:04:15 - 3:04:26)
Alderman Waguespack moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the records from the plan commission are incorporated.

[Speaker 5] (3:04:28 - 3:06:41)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'll proceed. This relates to an approximately 62,000 square foot parcel located at 400 North Elizabeth in the Fulton Market neighborhood.

Property is currently zoned C33, and we are requesting the rezoning to the DX5 prior to establishing a business plan development for a life sciences building. The subject property will be improved with a 270 foot tall, 16 story mixed use commercial office and life sciences building with 131 parking spaces. The overall FAR will be 8.1 resulting in a nearly four and a half million dollar bonus payment to the neighborhood opportunity bonus fund. I did want to note, as you noted already, that a couple of speakers during the public comment commented on some concerns that they had. What I think they failed to acknowledge is that this project did receive a very robust community input and process as is always the case in the 27th ward. We had several community meetings over the course of many months with local stakeholders, and ultimately the building design in direct response to their concerns was transformed to reduce the impact on affected properties and to provide relief in very important ways as noted on the slides.

Notably, the height of the building shrunk by 40 feet and three stories, and there was also a significant setback incorporated to move the building west, thereby creating a setback for the benefit of the condominium building located immediately across the street to the east. Also, in response to requests by DPD and neighborhood stakeholders, the original above-grading parking was moved to below grade, creating an important design enhancement and mitigating the impact on nearby properties. Also, the developer agreed to pay and otherwise facilitate a litany of traffic improvements that were identified as neighborhood priorities, including by Alderman Burnett, even beyond the immediate zone of impact associated with the project.

In recognition of this level of responsiveness over many months, we received letters of support which are in the plan commission record from three community groups in Fulton Market. And as I mentioned, those were incorporated into the record of this proceeding. Therefore, we request this body recommend approval to the full city council.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:06:48 - 3:06:51)
Thank you, Rich. Alderman Burnett on this item.

[Speaker 2] (3:06:53 - 3:10:22)
Yeah, Mr. Chairman, and if I'm not mistaken, this did go before the plan commission. And so this did go before the plan commission. As the council has said, we've been dealing with this for more than a year.

The renditions of it has changed in response to the community. Of course, you never can satisfy everyone. This is an industrial area, right?

It always have been an industrial area before this used to be a Budweiser Corporation storage place and production company for Budweiser. And then before that, it was another industry. With both of those industries, and with both of those industries, there's always been big trucks, traffic, people, all of the above.

Before we turned this to a PMD, there was a condo that slipped into this community that's been there for years. I encourage the developers specifically to work with the condo association to make sure that they were okay because they're the closest ones to it. And they work with them.

Of course, they weren't able to satisfy everyone who lived in a building. Most of the owners of that building do not live there. There, I would say more than 50% of the owners of the building don't live there.

There's a few people that live in that building. So we did everything we could to accommodate them. They opened up the space.

They offered a beautiful side walkway next to that building, which was a dead end to that community and sort of dangerous. They lit it up. They changed the parking because of the residents.

They added green space over to... They added green space on Racine Street and Kodosak. They're going to Kodosak an area and put parking there in green space to satisfy the community.

We've gotten a developer to do a lot of things in reference to the community's concerns. Outside of folks, some people not wanting their views blocked, which I don't think it would block their views anyway. And people just don't want anything built across the street from them and not recognizing that they are in an industrial area.

We've encouraged them to do a lot to satisfy this community. That's why you have three community organizations, West Loopgate, the West Central Association and the neighbors of the River West Association to satisfy this. Knowing that this area has changed massively from...

We did a DX in this whole community, in this whole area, to increase the downtown density in this area. So something was going to happen there sooner or later. But we had to get this developer to work with the community and change his designs to satisfy the community more.

They also added a lot of amenities that's going to be for neighbors.

[Speaker 34] (3:10:28 - 3:10:29)
Thank you.

[Speaker 2] (3:10:32 - 3:12:03)
Folks from planning, we had a special meeting where planning came and testified in reference to it, but also World Business Chicago testified in reference to it. Because that we're doing in this area to compete with other cities throughout the country in order to attract this economic development to the city of Chicago. So this is going to be folks in there doing life sciences, doing research and development, and also potentially move into this community and is going to enhance a old warehouse spot with a lot of trucks into a beautiful building and a lot of amenities to add to the community.

I know I can't satisfy everyone. And I also always say that, we try not to satisfy everybody. We try to satisfy the majority of the people, but we also try to make everyone better.

This building will make the community better, not only for this neighborhood, but also for the city of Chicago with the jobs and the amenities that's going to come from these folks working in this neighborhood. It is an industrial area that coincidentally happened to have one condo, well, two condo buildings right there. But outside of that, there's no other condo buildings in this area.

And we ask for the committee support for this. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:12:04 - 3:12:13)
Thank you, Alderman Burnett. I see we have Alderman Hopkins. Brian, you want to comment on this?

[Speaker 21] (3:12:13 - 3:12:55)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yeah, I appreciate the difficulty and the sensitivity when you have a PMD that has residents either grandfathered in or directly adjacent to it. And when there's redevelopment use proposed, I expect that you're going to have to deal with what Alderman Burnett dealt with here.

But it sounds like Alderman Burnett dealt with it successfully. You made reasonable accommodations, modifications to address the concerns. And I know that it was a lengthy process.

But it sounds like you landed on a space that is good for all interests involved. So I commend my colleague, Alderman Burnett. I will be supporting this project and I urge my colleagues to vote aye.

Thank you.

[Speaker 34] (3:12:58 - 3:12:59)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (3:12:59 - 3:13:54)
Other questions, comments? All right. Alderman Hopkins makes the motion, move to pass the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections to the motion? Hearing none, this item is passed as revised. Thank you, Rich.

It's a handsome building. It's going to be a big asset. Great asset for the city.

All right. Next item. Bottom of page 10, document number 20707, 27th ward, ordinance was referred on May 26th of 21.

Common address is 315 North May Street, also 1112 West Carroll. The change request, DX7, downtown mixed use district, then to a residential business plan development. Rich Clowder.

[Speaker 5] (3:13:55 - 3:14:22)
Rich. Thanks again, Mr. Chairman. For the record, Rich Clowder from the law firm of DLA Piper.

Good afternoon to you and to committee members. As a preliminary matter, this application also was considered and recommended for approval of the October 21st, 2021 plan commission hearing. And as with the item before, we've requested the transcript from the hearing of the plan commission on October 21st be incorporated into the record here today.

[Speaker 1] (3:14:24 - 3:14:37)
Alderman Hopkins moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine form. Any objections to the motion? Hearing none, the items from plan commission are now incorporated.

Rich.

[Speaker 5] (3:14:38 - 3:16:24)
Thank you. So the applicant here is Trammell Crow Chicago Development. They are a very active developer, especially in this part of town.

This is an approximately two acre site located on the north and south sides of Carroll between Aberdeen and May. It's currently zoned M23. And as you noted, we are requesting a rezoning to the DX7 prior to establishing a residential business plan development.

This is a two sub area PD. The north side of Carroll will contain a 33 story building with 377 residential units and approximately 90 parking spaces. The south side of Carroll will contain a 26 story office building with 650,000 square feet of office, 180 parking spaces and ground floor commercial.

The overall FAR will be 11.5 and results in a nearly $9.5 million bonus payment to the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund bonus fund. This project is notable in many respects. It's providing all 20% of the affordable units on site in the residential building.

It's also providing an unprecedented 35,000 square foot public open space on the north sub area. And you can see it depicted here on the landscape design slide in front of you. This project has undergone an extensive process of community review, and it's the first project to have been considered by the new committee on design.

I want to thank Alderman Burnett and DPD and the committee on design for making a very good project, a great project and for your support and input throughout this very evolving and iterative process. Accordingly, we respectfully request a favorable recommendation from this committee. Thank you very much and happy to answer any questions you might have.

[Speaker 1] (3:16:28 - 3:16:34)
Again, this is in the 27th Ward, Alderman Burnett. Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 2] (3:16:34 - 3:18:23)
So as the councilor mentioned, so this would be for three community organizations also, but in this case it's the West Loop State, West Central Association, and also the neighbors of the West Loop. This area is an area where we encourage 20% affordable and the Department of Planning encourage a developer with city assistance to try and do 30% affordable housing. So it's definitely going to be 20% affordable housing in this development and hopefully working with the planning department and they coming up with the resources, it'd be 30% affordable housing in this development.

It's going to bring hundreds of jobs to the community. The developer is committed to partnering with a joint contractor, African-American joint contractor in order to build this building along with the previous building that was built and hiring people from the community. A lot of great economic development and resources to this neighborhood.

It's just another addition to all of the great things that is going on in the neighborhood. The Department of Planning had several meetings in regards to this design, made them change the design, change the part, they were the first ones to go before this design committee. So this project kind of broke ground for everybody else that's coming behind it.

On the timeline and the due diligence in order to get a project done. So we didn't have anyone against this project. We asked the committee for their support on this project.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:18:26 - 3:19:16)
Thank you, Alderman. Very interesting bird's eye view on this whole area in regards to the expansion of downtown in the West Loop area and further. So it's not like our residents don't know what's going on in that area there.

And it is amazing progress. I think if we didn't have the 27th Ward, we would be in economic doldrums with the city. I appreciate that.

All right, questions, comments? Can I get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderman Hopkins makes the motion.

Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, this item is passed as revised.

[Speaker 5] (3:19:16 - 3:19:19)
Thank you very much and happy Thanksgiving to everybody.

[Speaker 1] (3:19:20 - 3:19:54)
Same to you, Rich. All right, top of page 11, document number 20840T1 in the 27th Ward. The ordinance was referred on September 14th of 21.

This common address 1521 through 1525 North Elston. And the change request M23 Light Industry District to C333, I'm sorry, C33 Commercial Manufacturing and Employment District. We have Tim Barton on the call on this one.

[Speaker 34] (3:19:56 - 3:19:56)
Tim?

[Speaker 16] (3:20:02 - 3:20:03)
You're not on, Tim.

[Speaker 1] (3:20:05 - 3:20:06)
Tom rings.

[Speaker 16] (3:20:07 - 3:20:09)
Yeah, I'm here. Chairman, can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (3:20:09 - 3:20:12)
Tom, do you want to take the charge on this or do you want to wait for Tim?

[Speaker 16] (3:20:12 - 3:20:37)
Yeah, Tim's coming. There was a substitute. There was a typo in the application in the narrative.

It's a type one. Tim, you want to come in here? Sorry, one second.

Tim's coming in here. And so there's a substitute.

[Speaker 21] (3:20:37 - 3:20:42)
The documents were just sent over to Anna and Fernando. So Tim's coming and we just finished that.

[Speaker 1] (3:20:43 - 3:20:46)
Let's check with Anna Robles on these, please. Anna?

[Speaker 15] (3:20:52 - 3:20:53)
Is Noah on the call?

[Speaker 25] (3:20:54 - 3:20:54)
Hello?

[Speaker 1] (3:20:56 - 3:20:59)
Anna, we're on 1521 North Austin, please.

[Speaker 25] (3:21:01 - 3:21:16)
Afternoon. I was just notified of a minor typo and changes. I discussed it with Noah because of the Chicago Plant Commission passage.

So they have no issues with it.

[Speaker 1] (3:21:17 - 3:22:06)
All right. So we need to reincorporate the substitute. OK, so we've got two motions here.

First of all, we're going to Alderman Kerry Austin moves to incorporate the records from the Plant Commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to her motion? Hearing none, the records are incorporated.

And now we have a, as Anna said, we have a slight substitute. But Alderman Kerry Austin moves to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Again, any objections to her motion?

Hearing none, the substitute is before us. All right, let's get to the meat of the issue here.

[Speaker 6] (3:22:07 - 3:26:13)
Good. I believe we have on the line Alex Purcell, who's one of the owners of the 1521-25 Elston Adventures LLC. Who we represent.

The parcel, I believe you have slides here, but I'll just go through briefly. So the parcel under consideration is a 21,085 square foot building. It's an existing building.

It's a six story building. It's nearing completion. The permit for it was issued in 2019.

It was built under the M2-3 zoning that is in effect right now. The owner wants to expand the allowable office use for this parcel from 9,000 square feet that's allowed in the M2 to cover the entire building. Therefore, the C3-3 is necessary.

This is in the south branch, or rather it's in the south part of the north branch industrial corridor. These are views of the building. This is a view of the building, an aerial view of the building.

Looking northeast, you can see that the Lincoln Yard plan development is at the very top of the screen. Home Depot is another major plan development in the area. So this area of Elston Avenue between North Avenue and LeMoyne is somewhat desolate.

It immediately across the street was the former Stanley's fresh fruit and vegetable stand. The block has residential, mostly residential on it, and office uses. This building itself is on the site of a former residence.

There is parking here for 21 cars. The parking has been reviewed. The parking and the access has been reviewed by CDOT and approved.

The site is 300 feet south of the bus stop for the number nine Ashland Avenue bus. The Ashland Avenue bus makes a jog over to North Avenue. And it's also obviously on the 300 feet south of the number 16 North Avenue bus.

So as such, it qualifies as a transit serve location. The proposed rezoning was reviewed by North River Works, who is there in support of it, as is the alderman. This is a view of the building from the north.

So as you can see, it's virtually completed. Again, all of the tenancy for this building, or most of the tenancy, would be offices based on the new zoning. There's potential here for 100 jobs.

There was a conversion fee paid for this because it's in the industrial corridor and it's being changed from an M to a C district. The conversion fee was paid. That was $105,962.

With that, that concludes my testimony. Thank you. And if there are any questions, we'll be happy to take them.

Do you have to address the substitute?

[Speaker 34] (3:26:14 - 3:26:15)
All right.

[Speaker 6] (3:26:15 - 3:26:20)
Do you want me to address the specific substitute changes?

[Speaker 1] (3:26:21 - 3:26:25)
No, I think we'll just hear from Alderman Burnett on this. The building is existing, right?

[Speaker 6] (3:26:25 - 3:26:32)
Yes, it is. And it's being, it's a T1 and it's based on the T1. The existing building.

[Speaker 1] (3:26:32 - 3:26:33)
All right.

[Speaker 2] (3:26:33 - 3:27:07)
Let's hear from Alderman Burnett, please. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So this is pretty much a no-brainer.

They've just taken an existing building and allowing for more usable space inside of the building for offices. I had them to meet with the local community organization, which in this case is North Branch Works. They gave a letter of support for this.

You know, everyone thought that this was a no-brainer. So we support this. We ask for the community support.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:27:08 - 3:27:39)
Thank you, Alderman. Questions, comments from committee? Walter, Rich Clowder has talked about the Stanleys.

This building looks a little bit out of context. Is that because there's still a lot more development in the pipeline over there? So, unfortunately, I'm not a prophet.

So, I don't know, but. I thought we did the Stanleys piece. I thought we did something on that.

We haven't done Stanleys yet.

[Speaker 2] (3:27:40 - 3:27:48)
They, some folks are thinking about doing some things on Stanleys. And we'll see if that'll still be in our wards. So we'll take it a day at a time, okay?

[Speaker 1] (3:27:49 - 3:28:31)
All right. Comments, questions for the Alderman? Hearing none, can I get a motion?

Move, do pass. By the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Noting that this item has been in plan commission and a substitute.

Alderman Kerry Austin makes the motion. Move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to the motion?

Hearing no objections, this item is passed as revised and substituted. All right. Thank you, Rich.

I think we're.

[Speaker 6] (3:28:32 - 3:28:33)
Thank you very much, Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (3:28:35 - 3:28:37)
Yeah, Tim, thank you very much, sir.

[Speaker 6] (3:28:37 - 3:28:39)
Thank you, members of the committee.

[Speaker 1] (3:28:40 - 3:29:07)
All right. Middle of page 11. Document number 20749-T1 in the 26th ward.

This ordinance was referred on June 23rd of 21. Common address is 3518 through 3556 West Division Street. The change request.

M21 Light Industry District to C21 Motor Vehicle Related District. Amy Miles.

[Speaker 32] (3:29:11 - 3:29:13)
Yes, I'm here. Can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (3:29:14 - 3:29:16)
Are you Amy, please?

[Speaker 32] (3:29:16 - 3:30:13)
Yes, this is Amy Miles with PB2 Architecture for the record. Again, Amy Miles, PB2 Architecture and Engineering. Attending alongside Peter Cacciatore, property owner for 3518 through 3556 West Division Avenue and applicant Joanna Frisk of O'Reilly Auto Parts.

We are making application to amend the zoning map from M2-1 Light Industrial District to C2-1 Motor Vehicle Related District. O'Reilly Auto Parts offers retail customers and professional installers the best combination of price and quality in the retail sale of automotive parts and supplies for private use. This amendment will allow O'Reilly Auto Parts to renovate the existing 29,028 square foot building, formerly Blast Fitness, and operate a retail establishment for that purpose.

No changes will be made to the building footprint or the bulk size of the building. We are grateful for a letter of approval from Alderman Maldonado, dated October 5th, 2021, which I believe the committee has received.

[Speaker 1] (3:30:15 - 3:30:36)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Maldonado. Excellent. Do we have any, my staff saying do we need to move on the substantive narrative and plans or are we good as is?

Amy?

[Speaker 32] (3:30:37 - 3:30:39)
I'm sorry, one more time.

[Speaker 1] (3:30:39 - 3:30:43)
Do we need to move to accept the substantive narrative and plans?

[Speaker 32] (3:30:43 - 3:30:44)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (3:30:44 - 3:31:26)
Type one? Yes. Okay.

So we'll do that first. Alderman Hopkins moves to accept the substantive narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that?

So hearing no objections, the substantive narrative and plans are accepted. And I believe, do you have anything more to add, Amy? No, sir.

All right. Questions from committee members? Hearing no questions.

Can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 30] (3:31:27 - 3:31:28)
Moved to pass, Chairman. Alderman Wagesback.

[Speaker 1] (3:31:28 - 3:31:45)
Alderman Wagesback moves to pass. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none.

This item is passed with the substantive narrative and plans. All right. Thank you, Amy, and good luck on the redevelopment.

[Speaker 32] (3:31:45 - 3:31:46)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (3:31:46 - 3:32:31)
Bottom of page 11, number 20564 in the 25th ward. Ordinance was referred on December 16th of 2020. This common address, 1930 through 2050 South Jefferson Street, 1927 through 2051 South Des Plaines Street, 2020 through 2050 South Des Plaines Street, 2037 through 51 South Ruble Street, and 563 through 571 West Cullerton Street.

The change request, plan development number 1123 to B23 Neighborhood Shopping District. Tyler Manick, please, on this one.

[Speaker 23] (3:32:32 - 3:33:43)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Tyler Manick of Shane Banks, Kenyon-Schwartz. I'm here on behalf of New Chan LLC, which owns the subject, the 248,158 square foot vacant parcel at the property address that Mr. Chairman just recited. The property subject to PD 1123, which was established back in 2008. The mixed use development contemplated in PD 1123 was never commenced under PD statement 17. The property automatically converts to a B23 zoning district if construction is not commenced within six years of that 2008 date.

Since construction was not commenced in six years, the applicant who has since acquired this property seeks to effectuate that PD statement number 17 and convert the zoning back to the B23 zoning district. The applicant has met with the alderman who has given this committee his letter of support. With the support of the alderman, I respectfully request this committee's favorable recommendation to rezone this parcel back to a B23 zoning district, and I'd be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (3:33:44 - 3:34:05)
All right. We do have this letter of support from Alderman Siccio-Lopez. Is Byron on the call?

No, but we do have letter of support on the down zoning and revert it back to the underlying zoning.

[Speaker 13] (3:34:06 - 3:34:14)
Chairman, sorry, I was muted. But yes, we're in support and we actually ask our colleagues for favorable support as well. My apologies.

[Speaker 1] (3:34:15 - 3:34:22)
Yeah, and this is based on inaction over the last six years from PD number 1123, correct?

[Speaker 23] (3:34:22 - 3:34:23)
Correct, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (3:34:24 - 3:36:38)
Okay, all righty. Questions for the alderman or the applicant? Hearing none.

Alderman Mike Rodriguez makes a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Now we're moving on to page 12, document number 20657, 22nd Ward. Ordinance was referred on March 24th of 21. We have a series of addresses and I'll start with South Cicero Avenue, 4210 through 4258.

4300 through 4358 and 4400 through 4458, all on South Cicero Avenue. Let me see, next is going to be on LaPorte. And those addresses are 4800 through 4926, 4801 through 4959, West 44th, I'm sorry.

That's on West 44th. Yeah, okay, 4959 West, 44th Street. Those previous ones, let me repeat, I'm sorry.

4800 through 4926, 4801 through 4959, all on West 44th Street. And now on LaPorte, we have 4301 through 4359 South LaPorte. Now we're moving to 4800 through 4958 West 45th Street.

And finally, 4401 through 4435, also 4441 through 4459 South Laverne Avenue. This change request, RS3 residential single unit detached house district to B33, community shopping district, and then to apply development. We have Carol Stubblefield on this call, on this application, Carol.

[Speaker 15] (3:36:40 - 3:37:08)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. For the record, Carol Stubblefield with Neal and Leroy, office is located at 20 South Clark here on behalf of the applicants Chicago Housing Authority. With me today are members from the CHA and from their partner Cabrera Capital.

Mr. Chairman, this matter was unanimously approved at the October 21 2021 Chicago Plan Commission and we do ask that the findings and conclusions of the Chicago Plan Commission and all documents given to the Department of Planning and Development be adopted into today's record.

[Speaker 1] (3:37:10 - 3:37:22)
Okay, Alderman Hopkins moves to incorporate the records from the Plan Commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that? Hearing none, the records are incorporated.

Carol, you want to proceed?

[Speaker 15] (3:37:23 - 3:39:33)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I believe there are some slides. So as I'm speaking, I don't know if somebody can just kind of click through as we go just to orient the members of the committee today or were those not populated.

Or here we go. Good. Okay, great.

I just wanted to make sure we have them. Okay, perfect. Okay, so the applicant proposes to rezone the 32 acre site to the residential business plan development for the purpose of redeveloping the property with approximately 725 dwelling units, 440,000 square feet of commercial space, publicly accessible open space and accessory parking spaces.

This is the this site is the former home of LeClaire Courts, a Chicago Housing Authority project developed in the 1950s that contained approximately 650 public housing units. The project will be constructed in phases and the site has been divided into two sub areas. Next slide.

Phase one development will include a 60,000 square foot grocery store and a 50,000 square foot medical office building. The project also includes various right of way adjustments that will reestablish the street grid system and improve traffic and pedestrian circulation within the site and the adjacent residential neighborhood. The next slide please.

The applicant has complied with all notice requirements and obtained the required approvals from CDOT, FHIR and MLPD. The project will comply with the city's goals for diversity and minority participation, sustainability and stormwater management policies. The project will also exceed the city's affordable housing ordinance percentages with 50% of the units constructed as affordable.

Phase one construction is anticipated to start in the second quarter of 2022 and be completed in the second quarter of 2023. The development team has earned the full support of the community and Alderman Rodriguez after working together and collaboratively on these plans for over two and a half years. Mr. Chairman, that completes our testimony today. We respectfully request your approval of the matter and the team is available to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (3:39:34 - 3:39:44)
Thank you, Carol. I know that Alderman Rodriguez would like to speak on this redevelopment project. Mike.

[Speaker 11] (3:39:45 - 3:42:45)
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I appreciate it and I appreciate you, Carol and CHA and Cabrera for being here today. I also want to thank the Greater Southwest Development Corporation for their comments.

The Southwest Collective, Hearst Community Organization as well who appeared before the plan commission to support this project and for the unanimous and enthusiastic support for this development at the plan commission. The developer has gone above and beyond my requests in offering over 20 community presentations, five in the last month, to very important groups. The CHA working group that's been monitoring this development for years, a presentation to right-to-return residents, and in addition, presentations to local business groups and community leaders and elected officials.

This development right off the I-55 expressway as you exit on Cicero Avenue going towards Midway Airport really will be a catalyst for economic development on the southwest side of Chicago. And let me be frank, this will be the largest development on the southwest side of Chicago since Midway Airport. In addition to a 50,000 square foot federally qualified health center that will provide significant services to all in the community, there will be a 60,000 square foot grocer.

My first day's knocking on doors in this area. That's what pretty much everyone mentioned, the need for a grocer here in the community. It's on its way.

In addition, there'll be a number of commercial elements which will bring ownership opportunities to the diverse community on the southwest side of Chicago. There'll be hundreds of construction jobs. Our Hearst School, which is right down the street and is under-enrolled, will hopefully fill up.

And I'm really excited because in the last two to three months, I've received more interest on Cicero Avenue development than I have in the last two or three years combined. We have a new Dunkin' Donuts renovation happening, a local nonprofit coming in, recruiting a well-known restaurant to open its doors with a training center. And we have the Academy for Global Citizenship also opening in stores in the next couple of months or getting it to the ground with a $35 million investment there.

So Cicero Avenue is on the map. It's an area for expansive growth. There's a lot of opportunity here.

This development will not only bring these elements that we just talked about, but it will improve traffic lights, add traffic lights, improve pedestrian safety for the whole community. We're really excited about this one. We've got near unanimous support.

I don't think you ever get unanimous, but we're about there on this project. So I'm really excited about it. And I wish for the favorable consideration of my colleagues here today.

Thank you, Mr. Chair.

[Speaker 1] (3:42:45 - 3:43:26)
Thank you, Mike. Amazing project. And funny you make the comparison with Midway Airport.

You know, it's amazing how long ago you've had this opportunity, you know, and it's a real credit to you and your community to be able to, and Cabrera to get this project out of the ground. And so congratulations. Any questions or comments?

Hearing none. I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine form with the incorporation of the planned commission.

[Speaker 5] (3:43:27 - 3:43:28)
So moved by Alderman Cardona.

[Speaker 1] (3:43:29 - 3:44:27)
Alderman Cardona makes that motion. Any, anyone opposed to the motion? Hearing none.

This item is passed as revised. Congratulations again. All right.

Now we're on the bottom of page 11. No, we're not. All right.

Bottom of page 12. And it is our last item. Is that correct?

We have to go back to Cardenas, right? Okay. All right.

So we have one more item after this, but let me read this one into the record. Number 20740 Second Ward. Ordinance was referred on June 23rd of 21.

Common address 171 West Oak Street. Change request. Residential plan development number 156 as amended.

The DX5 downtown mixed use district.

[Speaker 10] (3:44:28 - 3:45:07)
And then to residential plan development number 156 as amended. Steve Friedland, please. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman. Steve Friedland with the law firm of Applegate and Thornton. Here on behalf of my client, who may be, may or may not be on, Rich Charlton from the Pennant Housing Group. But this is a request to amend an existing plan development, plan development 156.

We did go before the planned commission on October 21st and received an approval from them. I would request that you incorporate the record of the planned commission into your hearing.

[Speaker 1] (3:45:13 - 3:45:24)
Alderman Wagesback moves to incorporate the records from the planned commission by the same roll call that was used to determine form. Any objections? Hearing none, the records are incorporated.

[Speaker 10] (3:45:25 - 3:47:39)
Steve, would you continue? Thank you. So, and you might just move.

Thank you. Move to the next slide. The property in question has historically been known as Jenkins Hall.

This property was approved as a planned development back in 1976. And at that time, it was a 201 unit elderly residential building. And it operated like that for a while.

Moody Bible Institute eventually acquired it. And Moody started to move in students into the building. And in 2014, so a few years ago, the plan development was amended to retain 90 elderly and disabled residents under an existing section eight HAP contract in the building.

With the remaining 111 units being leased to Moody students. Moody put the property on the market all over a year ago, and was looking to sell the building. My client was a successful purchaser, bought the building with the goal of keeping those 90 section eight HAP units in place.

But obviously, there aren't any Moody students there anymore. So our request was really a technical request under the plan development to allow for the 111 units of the 201 to be occupied as residential. It's not student units.

So again, the plan would be that the 90 elderly and disabled units would remain. And we would lease the remainder of the building as a residential building. I would note that there will be a significant rehab done to the building, where, you know, the existing elderly unit residents will really benefit from that, because they'll get new appliances, carpeting, painting.

And, you know, the building sort of needs that overhaul. So this is going to allow that to occur. With that, like I say, my clients here, but we certainly take any questions you might have.

[Speaker 1] (3:47:42 - 3:47:50)
All right, Steve. Questions from committee members? This is in the second ward, Alderman Hopkins.

[Speaker 21] (3:47:52 - 3:48:38)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is one of the most important affordable housing developments in the entire second ward. I'm in full support of this project.

As the attorney for the applicant mentioned, this will include a substantial capital investment into renovating the existing building. It needs it. And there will be zero displacement of existing residents, despite the extensive work that will be done.

That was important as well. We did ask for that to be incorporated into the narrative of the plans, and it will be. So this is a rock solid guarantee that the residents will continue to be residents, even as the capital improvement project goes forward.

So I'm in full support of this, and I would urge an aye vote.

[Speaker 1] (3:48:41 - 3:48:54)
Thank you, Brian. Questions for the applicant or the Alderman? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 21] (3:48:56 - 3:48:56)
So moved.

[Speaker 1] (3:48:57 - 3:49:11)
Alderman Hopkins makes that motion. Any objection to his motion? Hearing none, this item is passed as revised.

All right, our last item.

[Speaker 34] (3:49:11 - 3:49:12)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:49:12 - 3:49:49)
Thank you, Steve. Our last item, we'll go back to page two on the Aldermanic. I'll read it into the record.

Aldermanic application 8720 in the 12th ward. Ordinance was referred on September 14th of 21. Common address is 3300 to 3900 South Ashland Avenue.

And I'm going to ask for a motion to defer this item. By the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Noting that this is on behalf of Alderman Cardenas.

[Speaker 24] (3:49:50 - 3:49:50)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (3:49:50 - 3:50:11)
All right. Alderman Cardona moves to defer this item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that?

Hearing none, this item is to be deferred. All right. I think we've gone through the agenda staff.

Did we miss anything? No. We certainly had a hiccup.

[Speaker 21] (3:50:13 - 3:50:38)
Point of order. Yes. Is that Alderman Hopkins?

It is. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think we may have missed one item in the second ward.

Document number 4593 on page nine. The address 1545 West Thomas. Did we skip that or did we do it?

We might've done it while I stepped out of the room. We did do it. Yes.

Okay. Thank you. All right.

[Speaker 1] (3:50:38 - 3:50:49)
And Brian testified on your behalf too. Yeah. Brian from your staff testified on your behalf.

All right. Thank you. Does he still...

He worked for you, right?

[Speaker 21] (3:50:49 - 3:50:58)
We didn't get a pseudo representative. I only hire people named Brian just to avoid confusion.

[Speaker 24] (3:50:58 - 3:51:00)
Well, we're just double checking.

[Speaker 1] (3:51:00 - 3:51:16)
All right. Well, thanks everyone for your time and patience today. It was going to be a smoother meeting, but we got a little technical problems.

But with that, I'm going to ask for a motion to adjourn. Can I get that?

[Speaker 24] (3:51:17 - 3:51:18)
So moved by Alderman Cardona.

[Speaker 1] (3:51:18 - 3:51:24)
Alderman Cardona makes the motion to adjourn. Any objections to that? Hearing none, the meeting is adjourned.

[Speaker 34] (3:51:25 - 3:51:27)
Have a great evening. We'll see you tomorrow, folks.
