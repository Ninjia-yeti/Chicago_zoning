All right. We're going to start this morning off with the approval of the rule 45 report containing the minutes of the July committee on zoning landmark and building standard hearing. All members of the committee should have received a copy of this report electronically.

And if hearing no objections, do I have a motion by the same roll call vote that was used to approve the minutes. Alderman Riley makes the motion. All those in favor say aye.

Aye. Opposed. Hearing no objection.

The report has been approved. Moving on. We will now hear the items to be deferred.

I will read the ward, the file number, the address, and lastly the reason for deferral and take a motion for all at the end. So starting in the 48th ward file number 20440 located at 5051 North Broadway. This item has not been before the plan commission in the 44th ward file number 20454 located at 1134 West diversity Parkway deferred per the attorney in the 42nd ward file number 20443 located at 400 through 418 East Grand Avenue, 529 through 549 North McClurg court and 401 through 429 East Ohio street.

This item has not been before the plan commission in the 40 41st ward file number 20441 located at 5656 North Newcastle Avenue. This item has not been for the plan commission in the 33rd ward file number 20442 located at 3557 West Lawrence Avenue is deferred per Alderman Rodriguez Sanchez in the 32nd ward file number 20450 T1 located at 1907 West Fullerton Avenue. This item has not been for the plan commission in the 27th ward file number 20457 T1 located at 1317 West North Avenue.

This item has not been for the plan commission in the 27th ward file number 20439 located at 1939 through 1959 West Lake street, 115 through 159 North Damon, 1900 through 1958 West Maypole 1901 through 1959 West Maypole. Is that true? We're both.

Oh, both sides of the street. I'm sorry. 1900 through 1948 West Washington, 100 through 146 North Walcott.

This item has not been before the plan commission also in the 27th ward file number 20444 T1 located at 1423 through 1427 North Sedgwick street deferred per the attorney. And lastly, in the 11th ward file number 20438 located at 2424 South Halsted street. This item has not been before the plan commission.

If no questions by committee members, do I hear a motion to defer these items by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? I'll move. Alderman Roboius moves to defer any objections.

Hearing none. These items are deferred at this time. We will now begin the public comment period out of respect for everyone's time.

Each speaker is limited to three minutes to address all items on the agenda. This will be the only opportunity to address these items on the agenda. We'll have separate public comment before each agenda item.

And we have seven speakers signed up today and we will start with speaker number one, Ina Oderman. Ina, are you connected?

[Speaker 17] (26:32 - 29:43)
Good morning. My name is Ina Elterman and I have lived on Whelan street with my family for 11 years. I will be speaking against the amendments to hotel project on wealth street and old town.

Please take a note it's agenda number 14 application number 20436. At the last meeting, our neighbors and I spoke passionately about how this project would negatively affect us. Alderman Burnett spoke in support of the project and then recused himself, making it clear that he has a personal connection.

In the comments I've submitted in writing, I have outlined his connection in detail. Please refer to it. No alderman was going to vote against a fellow committee member.

Nothing we said mattered. This was Chicago politics that gives our city the bad rep. Please make your decision based on what you have been elected to do.

What is best for your constituency, not what is best for your colleagues. Also, please remember your legal duties and responsibilities. Voting for this project will go against various laws and ordinances.

And should you vote for it, we will appeal. Please. Is somebody talking in the background?

Please review submitted documents for details. At the last hearing alderman Burnett said there was only a handful of us opposing the project and he has letters of support among the documents we have provided. You will find a petition signed by 688 community members.

Alderman has a letter from one family in support. This family is also building on the streets, so they need alderman support themselves. A lot of us know that there is a colony of black crowned night herons at the southernmost point of Lincoln park.

These are one of the rarest of the birds and endangered. There were only 50 left in 2007 and now there's 600. The hotel will be directly in their flight path.

There has been absolutely no studies done on how the proposed rooftop bar, its height, light, and sound will affect the environment. And no environmental environmentalists were consulted. Can we as a human race be responsible for another species to be gone, to make room for one more bar.

There is a five year over supply of hotel rooms in Chicago, even prior to pandemic making this hotel bigger than what has been approved will not bring any additional revenue or permanent jobs to the city. Last but not least, you're about to allow a 12 story hotel on a one lane, two block residential street with two schools. How can hotel make sense here from an urban planning perspective?

The applicants will tell you there is no hotel on Wheeland, but it's not true. Look at the plans for yourself. The single family homes are turned sideways and provide only 25 foot buffer.

Let me say it again. You're about to allow a 12 story hotel on a residential street with three stories, single family homes and two schools. Committee members, please think how you want to be remembered.

Please think of the Chicago. You want your children and grandchildren to grow up in the aesthetic, the environment, this historic significance and vote no. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (29:43 - 29:47)
Thank you. Next we'll hear from Colleen Murphy.

[Speaker 14] (29:53 - 29:54)
Hi, can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (29:54 - 29:56)
We can Colleen proceed.

[Speaker 14] (29:57 - 33:06)
Thank you. And adding to Ina's arguments, I also have been a resident of Wheeland street and have been in excess of 20 years. I live across the street from this project.

And I also obviously work in the community, just like everybody else on this call. There's four main points here that I would really like to draw your attention to. The first is the point that this developer came to the residents of this street and sat in on a community meeting in 2016.

It was a packed house tended by hundreds of people, none of which not one person was in support of this hotel project, other than the developer who happened to live on the street. Since then additional financial developers have been involved in the project. And obviously they have a financial interest in the outcome here.

They are now trying to renegotiate this project and the deal that they came to with the residents. Please turn to page 24 of their amendment proposal to you. You will see the renderings that they've submitted of the, of the changes they want to make in the wheel inside of the project.

And when you look at page 24, you will see the four single family hotel, or I'm sorry, sort for single family residences that they promised the street. And in exchange for agreeing to them to even, to build this PD in this hotel. Again, this hotel was sold as a boutique hotel with four single family homes on the residential side of the project.

Now for their own financial interest, they're trying to renegotiate that deal and build two 25 foot deep sideways homes on our street. Instead of the four single family homes, they promised us in exchange for our acquiescence to the very large project. That's the first part.

Second is this is not a minor amendment. You know how the municipal code reads. Minor amendments are to be brought before this board, not massive changes to a PD like they're proposing in this, in this case, obviously this is going to hurt our property values to have two sideways homes connected to a garage.

The third point is this is not in conformance with the street. That's one of the major tests you need. The lots on Wheelan are 120 to 125 feet deep on that side of the street.

These are going to be 25 feet deep attached to a parking garage. Lastly, and most importantly, please look at the Illinois law. The standard of review in this case is yes.

Is this change that you're about to make a law arbitrary and capricious. And when you read those cases, I urge you to look at the different zoning board appeals that have been brought before you. And lastly, I'd like to add that mayor Lightfoot introduced executive order to.

[Speaker 1] (33:07 - 33:27)
Okay. Thank you, Colleen. Your time is up.

Next speaker is, and I correctly, I apologize for mispronouncing. If I do Matt Lauvel, Matt. Yep.

Can you hear me? Yes, we can proceed, sir. Perfect.

[Speaker 16] (33:28 - 36:33)
This project is an example of everything that's wrong in the zoning process in Chicago. We as taxpayers and people who are directly affected by these developments should have a clear voice and be represented by our elected officials. And this is clearly not the case here.

Our community group, which is the old town merchants association has been run and the board has been handpicked by one of the partners in this particular deal. We have also been in multiple conversations with the DPD and sent multiple affidavits to them, which were actually never presented at the last zoning meeting. So we're not getting represented there.

Also, Alderman Burnett, he has been a close friend of the same major partner of the old town merchant society. And he was supposed to recuse himself of this particular case. Now he did, he did not vote, but he did give an absolute glowing review of how much support the community is giving this.

And at the end of his speech, he said, well I've got to recuse myself from voting. And three, if not four of the members specifically said they were going to vote for it based solely on what he said. That was their determining factor.

He also said that the developer had gone way out and above and had done several compromises and the compromises that he gave up were amazing. Well, there was zero compromise. The neighborhood got nothing.

The units went from 190 hotel units to 203. There was supposed to be no curb cuts. There is now two more additional curb cuts and there are, there were supposed to be four houses on the original plan.

Now they get cute and they say, Oh no, there, we went from four to three. That's not the case. The same exact equity member of this development owned the house just North of it.

So to change this, they added that in. It's not part of the product project whatsoever, 0%. And they're saying that that is one of the residential houses or a two, two multifamily location.

None of that's, none of that's the case. So we've got two additional curb cuts and we've lost two of the houses that we were supposed to have on there. We're not being represented here.

The overwhelming vote. And when asked Alderman Burnett said, if there's so much VMM out opposition to this, you know, why would you, you know, why should we vote? Thank you, Matt.

[Speaker 1] (36:33 - 36:38)
Your time is up. Next speaker, Rodney Brown. Rodney Brown, please.

[Speaker 25] (36:42 - 36:43)
Hello. Can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (36:43 - 36:45)
Yes, Rodney. You can proceed.

[Speaker 25] (36:46 - 38:58)
Thank you. My name is Rodney Brown. I'm a member of the executive committee of the North Linedale community coordinating council and the executive director of new covenant CDC in North Linedale.

I'm here to speak on behalf of the North Linedale employment network and the work they're doing in the community. Brenda Palms-Balmer, the executive director of that organization has been a community leader in North Linedale for more than 20 years now. The work they are doing to restore jobs for this community has been tremendous.

Brenda has been working at an early end for 20 years. She is one of the founding members of the North Linedale community coordinating council. When we look at the work that she's doing, she is looking to reduce unemployment in North Linedale by at least 10%.

The unemployment rate in North Linedale far exceeds that of the rest of the city of Chicago. And thereby say the state of Illinois, and the work they're doing there is work that needs to be done. She is looking to open up a campus and workforce development campus at 1111 South Holman in North Linedale.

And we are here to voice our support for that. NLCCC has more than 600 community members that are involved. We have 13 different committees.

We have 13 different chairs, all standing behind us saying, this is the organization that we want to see develop and build this workforce development center in our community. When we look at the work that she's done, they provide service to more than 500 clients a year. They produce over 400 different workshops, and they have a program called United Return, that helps ex-offenders find new jobs and change their lives.

So it's not just about finding new jobs. It's also about getting them the kind of service and support they need so they can be successful and maintain those jobs once they get them. The work that she's doing in our community is by far excellent, and no one has been able to do anything like that since she's been there.

So we are strongly supporting what she's doing. This workforce development campus is serving as an inspiration for the rest of the community. We look at the rest of the community-based organizations and we're looking at this and saying, if she can do this, we can do it as well.

We wholeheartedly ask that you support this effort, that you do anything you can to make sure that she gets what she needs out of this. And again, thank you for your time this morning.

[Speaker 22] (38:58 - 41:24)
Our next speaker is Kevin Sutton. Good morning, everyone. Can you hear me?

Yes, we can. Good morning. My name is Kevin Sutton.

I'm the executive director for the Foundation for Holman Square and for nearly 30 years, Holman Square has been a part of improving and doing community development in the North Lawndale community. We are on the phone this morning to wholeheartedly support the North Lawndale Employment Network and their new campus at 1111 South Holman. Brenda Palms Barber and her team represent all that is good about the city of Chicago and about the great West side of Chicago.

We are wholeheartedly supportive of her project. We believe that the work that NLEN does is beneficial and particularly given times like this is essential to the furtherance of Chicago and the community. We wholeheartedly support this project because it brings jobs to a very needed sector of the community.

Workforce development, financial literacy, reentry training, and all other kinds of development and career programming is essential to making our community great. And NLEN has been a part of that for now decades. We are so supportive of Brenda because her commitment and dedication are shining examples of what can be done when someone begins to ignore what the story and the narrative is and looks to a brighter hope and a brighter future for a once great metropolitan community and neighborhood.

And so the 1111 campus for North Lawndale Employment Network would serve as a bright spot and an asset for the entire city and yet even this country to see of all that is good and what can be done when people come together and make their voices heard. And we certainly want our voice to be heard in this decision regarding Brenda and North Lawndale Employment Network. We support the project, we support the mission and the vision, and we look forward to seeing her project come to fruition.

Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (41:27 - 41:40)
Our next speaker is Nancy Shock, I believe is the correct pronunciation. Nancy? Nancy?

[Speaker 20] (41:40 - 41:42)
Yes. Can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (41:42 - 41:44)
We can please proceed.

[Speaker 20] (41:44 - 44:32)
Thank you. My comments are regarding agenda item number 14, application number 20436 the Wells Hotel. My name is Nancy Schlack.

I have lived on Wells street near Schiller for the past 17 years. In that time, a number of residential buildings on Wells between North and Schiller have been added with two new buildings providing 73 additional rental units in the past year alone, almost directly opposite the proposed new hotel. Going one block further South to division adds a complex with 1200 more residential units.

The area has become more popular, more densely populated and more congested. Those of us who live here chose old town for its vibrant nature. Yet the traffic on weekend nights can be so dense that it can take nine minutes to drive just two blocks from North to Schiller.

Delivery trucks during the day, make the street seem like a slalom course. What will the hotel add to this? The plans for the proposed hotel have been opposed by the community from the start.

One of the reasons for the opposition was the large size and scope of the hotel and its impact on the already dense nature of the street. Concessions were made to gain community support and then promises were broken bait and switch. The developers did their own traffic studies, but where have these studies been published?

Did they figure how much longer it would take for emergency vehicles to reach a location on Wells, perhaps even their own hotel. In addition to the traffic congestion, the increased density impacts the infrastructure in ways that the developers have not addressed at community meetings. What about the power grid or the water and sewer requirements for a neighborhood where some of the infrastructure is over a hundred years old?

Where are the data? Each time the developers come back to us, it is to change one of the previously promised compromises, bait and switch. Now they have increased the number of rooms to 203 up from 190.

Each new iteration of their plan adds density rather than reduces it. There now will be venues available for rental by large groups that would be attractive for holding parties, more density, more noise. Ours is not just an entertainment district.

This is a place where people live. Please do not approve the latest changes that the developers are currently seeking. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (44:34 - 44:38)
Thank you. And our final speaker this morning is Carmen Balu.

[Speaker 27] (44:40 - 44:41)
Carmen.

[Speaker 40] (44:51 - 44:51)
Hi.

[Speaker 18] (44:52 - 44:53)
Hi, can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (44:54 - 44:56)
We can. Are you Carmen? Okay.

[Speaker 18] (44:56 - 44:57)
Yes, I am.

[Speaker 1] (44:57 - 44:58)
Thank you. Okay.

[Speaker 18] (44:59 - 47:54)
I am here to speak today in the favor of a passage of an ADU ordinance, but in particular, I want to request that it would include RS one and RS two houses in that ordinance. I am grateful to many of you present today for your work on this issue. But as a 47th ward.

Resident. I also want to thank Matt Martin for his advocacy on the issue. Our multi generational household.

has been following the ordinance closely because first, we support the expansion of affordable housing in our neighborhood. Our neighborhood has grown increasingly expensive and puts access to the quality neighborhood schools and the safety of the neighborhood provides out of reach for many. We support the addition of affordable housing units in many forms, but in particular today, I speak to pass an ADU ordinance to enable those additional units.

Second, we are interested in this option for our family of three generations. My parents moved from Nebraska three years ago and while they initially explored getting their own unit, we actually value our time together and living together close by. From sharing meals, to assisting with piano lessons, to playing numerous board games and we want to stay together.

We value the experience that multi-generational living provides, but an ADU would provide more privacy and independence to my parents than they currently have. However, as the proposed ordinance stands, we would not be able to build a garage apartment as a right for my parents. Whether intentional or a fluke of historical zoning, a few streets, including ours, are zoned RS2 and we would be excluded where much of the new construction, larger footprints around us, the larger footprint houses around us are RS3.

I'm speaking today to give you one example of why that exclusion would be a mistake. We live in a hundred year old house and are committed to keeping its historical look, but around us, bungalow after bungalow has been torn down and replaced by larger footprint houses. By excluding RS2 units, this would continue to encourage the demolition of the smaller houses to be replaced by larger footprint houses, rather than having options like ADU.

By building a garage apartment instead, we keep the historical look of our house, but simply expand our footprint off of an alley. And these twin goals of expanding affordable housing and encourage multi-generational living were goals that we supported before the outbreak of COVID. But now we've gone from two people, my parents home during the day with freedom and quiet, to two parents working from home, a third grader and a seventh grader enrolled in CPS as remote learning and two grandparents, all fighting for space and quiet.

While I realize that it's a privilege to be able to explore this option, requiring a special use permit with its additional costs and hassle that don't even guarantee approval will likely put this option out of reach. Please pass an ADU ordinance quickly, but please consider including RS1 and RS2 units in it. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (47:57 - 48:49)
Thank you. And that concludes the public commentary portion of the meeting. We'll start first with the second item on the addendum.

I know we have commissioner Morrison Butler here to speak on it. It's a direct introduction from the mayor authorizing temporary zoning uses in the 21st and 4th wards in response to COVID-19. Alderman Roboius moves to accept the direct introduction by the same roll call vote that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? So moved. Hearing none, the ordinance is accepted and directly introduced.

Now we'll have commissioner Morris Butler, a family and support services here to testify on the matter and answer any questions. Commissioner, you're on.

[Speaker 2] (48:50 - 52:14)
Good morning, Alderman, Chairman Tunney. Thank you very much. We are here today to ask for your support so that we can convert essentially and use as alternate shelter space some Chicago public school buildings.

The way the ordinance is written, this would be retroactive. We actually moved into these buildings already. And one of the things I wanted to do today was to give you a little bit of history on what we're doing.

So back in March, based on both the CDC recommendations as well as in a close partnership with CDPH, DFSS realized that we needed to decompress a number of our congregate shelter sites. The truth is we have shelters right now in about 27 wards. So our shelter footprint is really spread throughout the city.

And most of those existing shelters have smaller configurations of rooms, but we did have 15, that's one five, 15 congregate shelters where people were sleeping in bunk beds or in cots very close together in really large rooms. And so at the outbreak of COVID, it was clear that that was not going to allow us to keep those vulnerable populations safe. And so in the space of about eight days, we moved hundreds of beds out of those shelters into alternate sites.

Our initial alternate sites were in the private sector, and that's because those buildings were ready to go and we could get into them. And so we initially went into places like YMCA or to Salvation Army. And while we so appreciated those individuals, those organizations and their willingness to accept us, we did pay handsomely monthly rents for those locations.

And so as it became clear to us that COVID was not going anywhere anytime soon, we realized that the best use of taxpayer dollars were to find locations where we wouldn't have to pay rent. That led us to looking at city owned buildings. So we looked at park district facilities, we've looked at schools, et cetera.

And we are asking your permission today so that we can go into two facilities specifically that is the former Calumet High School and the former Young Women's Leadership School. Calumet is in Alderman Brookings Ward and Young Women's is in Alderman King's Ward. And we will, between those two buildings, it brings, it'll accommodate about 540 beds that we still need in order to be able to continue to decompress the shelter footprint.

This is a matter of health. So even though the emergency situation associated with COVID may have passed, the truth is from a human and social service standpoint, we are still very much in an emergency and we need to be able to decompress our existing shelters and continue to put these folks in other locations. Chairman Toney, I'll shut up now and just entertain questions.

I don't want to drone on if people are already familiar.

[Speaker 1] (52:15 - 52:33)
Thank you, Commissioner. Just, I know the first question that I have is Alderman Brookings and Alderman Sophia King. They've been briefed and what is their reaction?

Are they okay with it?

[Speaker 2] (52:34 - 53:05)
Both of them have been briefed. I think they are begrudgingly okay. I don't think that anyone, and I'm sure all of you understand this, no one gets excited about a homeless shelter in his or her ward.

We all understand that residents feel strongly about having homeless individuals next to them. So yes, we have briefed both of those aldermen, but neither one of them are excited, sir, and I wouldn't want to try to fool anybody into thinking that they were.

[Speaker 1] (53:06 - 53:22)
All right, so I see that we have Alderman Sophia King. Her hand is up, even though she's not a committee member, since it's pertinent to her community. I'm gonna ask her to speak on this item.

[Speaker 21] (53:23 - 53:24)
Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (53:25 - 53:26)
Sophia King.

[Speaker 21] (53:26 - 53:27)
Can you hear me, Chairman?

[Speaker 1] (53:28 - 53:29)
We can, thank you.

[Speaker 21] (53:29 - 55:02)
Okay, thank you. Thank you for allowing me to speak, and thank you, Commissioner. So this is obviously making sure that our most vulnerable population is safe during these unprecedented times is important.

South Fourth Ward is going to step up, as others have, to do their part. You know, we wanted to just make sure that the transition is smooth, not just for the residents who are living in the congregant, but for the residents who already live there as well. I just want to, you know, ask Commissioner, just so that my colleagues understand, you know, while we are doing this kind of temporarily, we don't understand how long temporary is, because, you know, we all don't understand how long COVID will be around.

But these numbers will probably go up, right, Commissioner, because of housing insecurities that will happen, because of, you know, rent, foreclosures, and other things as well. Do you have a number that you guys are predicting in terms of additional housing that we'll be needing?

[Speaker 2] (55:03 - 58:41)
So, Alderman, there's a couple of, you made some really strong points. I'm going to try to tease them apart. So there are currently roughly 4,000 shelter beds that exist in the city of Chicago.

DFSS funds 3,000 of those. One of the biggest shelters is Pacific Garden Mission, which is located right downtown in the center of downtown. They don't actually take government money.

And so you've got 3,000 beds that the city funds, 4,000 beds total. And even in last year's, in the 2019 point in time count, I believe there were 53 or 5,400 homeless people. So we have never in Chicago had the correct amount of shelter beds.

There has always been a gap. And that exists for a couple of reasons. As we said, it's very hard to open up a new shelter for multiple reasons.

And not all of it is political. I sure don't want it to feel like it's just residents. There also isn't necessarily money to go out and build them.

And so, for instance, the money that comes through DFSS doesn't go for capital. It goes to pay people to reimburse them to operate them. So there is already a gap.

And so that's an important thing to recognize. When we moved those hundreds of beds, those were not new beds. We didn't add beds to the system.

We simply decompressed to keep people safe. And Alderman, you raise a really good point. And you and I have talked about this recently.

And I've also talked to Alderman Osterman a lot about this as well. The National Alliance to End Homelessness, Columbia University, the Urban Land Institute. I've seen three or four articles and studies recently that are forecasting that homelessness could grow by 45%.

That's four or five. 45% in cities across America on the back end of COVID. Our colleagues at ULabs in Chicago have identified 106,000 households.

Folks who were not only employed in the occupations that were hardest hit upfront, our hospitality workers, our tourism industry workers, restaurant workers, et cetera. But those people are also already rent burdened, which means that 50% of their monthly income was going for rent. And so on the back end, it is very, very difficult for us to forecast the exact number.

But I mean, I think that that Columbia University study that talks about homelessness growing by 45%, that's something that we've got on our radar screen. We have been very fortunate thus far that the city's efforts have really been, I think, pretty incredible, the collaboration. So not only have we had a strong partnership with the Department of Public Health to make sure that we are embracing the health guidelines and creating partnerships with FQHCs to try to bring better supports to our colleagues.

We've also been talking a lot with Department of Housing. And so there has been, as you all probably recall recently, we did a collective fund that had, I think, 23 million from housing and DFSS also had 8 million. And that was out there for rental assistance and mortgage assistance.

So we are trying to make sure we see each other, but it is sobering, Alderman, it is sobering.

[Speaker 21] (58:41 - 59:31)
Yeah, and so Chairman, I just would like to say in closing that while we are stepping up and doing our part and helping with housing for the immediate congregate needs, there's gonna be a larger issue that this pandemic is going to hurl onto people who are already housing insecure. And as budget season comes up, we've got some hard decisions to make, but you hear the numbers. So I just encourage my colleague to think about that and for everybody to really step up so that we can make sure that our city and that our most vulnerable population is taken care of.

So that's what I'd like to say. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (59:31 - 1:00:17)
Thank you, Alderman, and thank you for your leadership on this very important issue. I have also heard from Alderman Brookins that he has no objection to this, but obviously reiterate some of your concerns, Alderman King. So just for the benefit of our colleagues, both Aldermen have given their support on this critical issue.

So hats off to both of you. Before I ask Alderman Lopez to go on, I see Chairman Osterman has his hand up. And obviously as chair of the Housing Committee, you might want to illuminate on this issue.

So Chairman Osterman.

[Speaker 23] (1:00:18 - 1:01:58)
Thank you, Chairman Taney. I think first I wanna really commend Commissioner Morrison-Butler. I think we are incredibly fortunate to have her in her role during this crisis, in addition to the many things that she does.

I think the reality of the matter before us is that it's an emergency. And I think that as someone who had a shelter that was opened up in the first phase of COVID, I think that her team was very professional to make sure that the issues on the ground were caring for people and caring for residents in the community. I think the bigger issue that Alderman King and Commissioner Morrison-Butler, I think is something that we as a council have to work on is that over the next year, the numbers of homeless in Chicago are gonna continue to grow.

And before COVID, the shelter infrastructure was not strong. And I think we, as we get into the budget process, have to look to what the next year to hold to make sure that we have a shelter system in place that can care for the people that are gonna need it. And there's gonna be lots of families and individuals that need our help.

And it's gotta be spread out around the city of Chicago. So I think that's something that as we get into the budget and the Housing and Real Estate Committee, the Zoning Committee and others will really focus on to make sure that we're have that safety net that's in place moving forward. Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 5] (1:02:00 - 1:02:16)
Alderman Ray Lopez. Thank you, Chairman. Good morning, colleagues.

Good morning, Commissioner. I just wanted to ask, so I'm understanding this correctly, Commissioner, we are already at these two locations, correct?

[Speaker 2] (1:02:16 - 1:02:17)
Yes, sir.

[Speaker 5] (1:02:19 - 1:02:39)
So we are retroactively going backwards for what purpose? Is this to legitimize our presence for the sake of funding reimbursement or why are we going backwards as opposed to just focusing on moving forward? Because we were- I would have thought that the Emergency Powers Ordinance would have covered us previously.

[Speaker 2] (1:02:40 - 1:04:07)
So Alderman, I'm not really sure about the Emergency Powers piece. I apologize for not being the expert on that. I do know that what we were trying to do was to make sure that the ordinance covered our presence in these buildings.

And so not only, because like I said, we moved in and by the way, that was one of the things that we did that actually caused some angst specifically for Alderman King. And so what we're trying to do is to make sure that the ordinance captures what we've actually done as well as what we intend to do. So we're in there.

We moved out and kind of did a transfer of locations a week or so ago and need to be in these locations up and through March 1. The money that was paid for Alderman, however, I do already have in my budget. These are part of my ESG dollars, my emergency solutions grant that comes to me from HUD.

DFSS is the entity that receives ESG funding from HUD. And so as we get into this phase that we're talking about now, we are thinking that ESG funding is the funding stream that will reimburse us. In the first phase where we did have some of the coronavirus relief funds, then yes, like lots of other city departments, we are trying to figure out whether or not we'll be reimbursed for what we already did in the first phase.

[Speaker 5] (1:04:08 - 1:04:13)
And if I may ask commissioner, what was the cost of both of these projects?

[Speaker 2] (1:04:14 - 1:04:14)
Oh.

[Speaker 5] (1:04:15 - 1:04:16)
For the build out and the reconstruction.

[Speaker 2] (1:04:17 - 1:05:00)
Alderman, I don't have that number with me. I apologize. I was on vacation last week.

I will get that to you through Chairman Tunney. And because you raise a good point, every time we switch locations, sir, we do have to do work in the building. And so for example, we needed to put showers at Young Women's.

And so that was something that we had to do. When we went into Calumet, there was obviously cleaning up that had to be done and trash removal. And so anytime we move, there's always work that goes into these buildings that gets them ready and habitable.

So I'll get those details to you through the chair, sir.

[Speaker 5] (1:05:03 - 1:05:44)
Thank you, commissioner. Are there any other locations that are waiting in the wings that we have done work? Because I do remember the decompression discussions we had on Zoom.

And I do wanna say that I applaud your efforts to try and keep our homeless population safe. I know we generally warehouse them, unfortunately, in many of these shelters and trying to find a way to keep them safe through creative means has definitely been a challenge. And I commend you for your efforts.

Are there other locations throughout the city that we have yet to hear about or that we need to start thinking about as well, similar to these two locations that will be on your decompression project list?

[Speaker 2] (1:05:45 - 1:07:04)
So right now, the short answer is no, sir, there aren't any. What we did, and by the way, when we start talking about buildings and negotiating leases, then you're way beyond my skillset. So I will tell you that it has been a very valuable to us to be able to partner with AIS.

And AIS acted as kind of a lead on helping us scope out buildings. So AIS and CPS first came together. There was a short list that was drawn up.

And then we would go into that list and talk about, so for example, there are still other CPS buildings, but some of them have now been vacant for so long that the cost associated with getting them ready was more than we wanted to spend. And so we went through a process like that that got us down to these two locations. And so my understanding is right now, we don't have other locations that are on our short list that causes my team a little bit of flux because March 1st, we'll be here before we know it.

And we do not believe that we will be past the COVID emergency in March. So we think that we will need to find other buildings that we can then move into because the way the ordinance is written, we would be coming out of these on March 1.

[Speaker 5] (1:07:06 - 1:07:09)
So then the duration of the lease is until March 1st for these two locations?

[Speaker 2] (1:07:10 - 1:07:46)
Yes, sir. And in these cases, Alderman, there is no lease, which is the good news. It's the ordinance would give us permission to stay there, but we're not paying rent, which is good because you pay for so many other things.

You still have to staff them. You still have to provide food, bedding, laundry services, et cetera. So there are other costs.

And that's one of the reasons why we were eager to not pay leases in privately owned buildings because we were looking for ways that we could reduce the cost of having to provide these decompressed sites.

[Speaker 5] (1:07:48 - 1:07:57)
Can you provide through the chair, a list of the community partners that will be assisting us at these two locations as well? Or is this all handled in-house for all those facilities?

[Speaker 2] (1:07:57 - 1:08:13)
No, it's not. There's a number. So for instance, Open Kitchens is handling, has the food contract with us because we already had a contract with them to do senior meals.

So we will get you a list of who's doing what.

[Speaker 5] (1:08:14 - 1:08:15)
Okay.

[Speaker 2] (1:08:15 - 1:08:16)
All right.

[Speaker 5] (1:08:16 - 1:08:17)
Thank you, Commissioner.

[Speaker 2] (1:08:17 - 1:08:18)
Thank you, sir.

[Speaker 5] (1:08:18 - 1:08:25)
Chairman, I have one other question. Excuse me. And it's for the, is Department of Public Health on this call this morning?

[Speaker 1] (1:08:26 - 1:08:29)
Let me check. Do we have someone from health on this?

[Speaker 32] (1:08:30 - 1:08:34)
Hi there, Megan Cunningham, Managing Deputy Commissioner from Public Health is on the line.

[Speaker 1] (1:08:35 - 1:08:38)
Megan, I think Alderman Lopez has a question for you.

[Speaker 5] (1:08:40 - 1:09:14)
Alderman Lopez. Okay, thank you, Chairman. Good morning.

Good morning, Megan. I want to ask about the medical testing sites for the temporary COVID testing sites. Does this also give you authority only to run this through March 19th?

Or would your ability as a department allow you naturally to create testing sites throughout the city should this continues as Commissioner Morrison-Butler just implied?

[Speaker 32] (1:09:14 - 1:09:59)
Thank you. Thank you for that question. So pursuant to section two of the ordinance, the Commissioner of Public Health can have these medical testing sites in any zoning district when such testing sites are required to assist in responding to the emergency.

And unlike section one, section two of the ordinance continues on until the Commissioner of the Department of Public Health has made a written determination that the threat posed by COVID is over. So we really have a more open-ended authority here to respond to the emergency at hand and to determine if and when testing sites are no longer needed. That March 1st date does not apply for the testing facilities.

It applies only to those decompression shelters that Commissioner Morrison-Butler was speaking about.

[Speaker 5] (1:09:59 - 1:10:24)
Understood, thank you. Do you think there's any value to moving forward having whether it's quarterly or semi-annually updates to the city council to determine if we are still comfortable with the language set forth in items like this, so that it's not just some indeterminate, never-ending policy of the city moving forward?

[Speaker 32] (1:10:26 - 1:11:16)
Sure, yeah. Happy to have further discussions with the Department of Law, IGA, and Alderman along these lines. The Department of Public Health reviews guidance from the CDC, as well as the Illinois Department of Public Health, along with our local data to make determinations about the course of COVID here in Chicago and what sorts of emergency needs will help us to best be positioned to respond to protect the health of our residents.

But I think we can have some ongoing discussion. My understanding is the commissioner does regular briefings with aldermen, both to provide information and to solicit input based on what you're hearing within your boards. I think those would surely continue.

But if you have proposals for other formal ways in which we should engage, I'm happy to take those back and to discuss with IGA and others.

[Speaker 5] (1:11:17 - 1:11:39)
Thank you. And Chairman, I can't remember the last time I had a briefing with the Commissioner of Public Health, but I think that rather than legislate their return every six months, perhaps that's something that this committee or even others could consider moving on in the future. Thank you, Chairman.

Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (1:11:39 - 1:11:40)
Alderman Maria Hadden.

[Speaker 34] (1:11:42 - 1:12:41)
Thank you, Chair. Commissioner Morrison-Butler and actually Alderman Ostrom, you were speaking to this as well. Thanks for being before us today to speak to this issue.

And thank you for sharing and kind of reminding us again of still the great need and the gap that we have in the people that we serve and the people that still need served. And I'm wondering just while we have you here, the shelter for decompression, the shelters for decompression, as you stated, we're not really adding beds, we're decompressing while maintaining these facilities. Given the information that you stated earlier, what Alderman Ostrom had to share as well, what Alderman King did, what are plans, if any, on more permanent, long-term housing solutions for our neighbors experiencing homelessness?

[Speaker 2] (1:12:43 - 1:16:11)
Alderman, one of the things that we were able to do during the real height of COVID, let's say the first phase of COVID, was to pilot an expedited housing initiative that we did that the Department of Public Health really was a close partner in. And so we did some shielding housing and then we did an expedited housing initiative. So the shielding housing was really focused on taking individuals who were 60 plus with underlying conditions and trying to move them out of the shelter system into the shielding housing.

And so because we had coronavirus relief funding and we could do that sort of thing, we kept those individuals in hotel rooms. And we are convinced that that strategy, that health really helped us pioneer, that that helped us keep individuals who were already incredibly vulnerable even before COVID from getting sick. And that was really something that we tried to do.

A lot of these things, Alderman, are tied to the funding. So I think that when we had those dollars, we tried to maximize on those dollars. The shielding housing I believe has, we've now sunset that particular thing.

And then the expedited housing initiative was really then an effort between the city and the continuum of care to try to reduce the amount of time that it takes to get people into housing once you've got them assessed. And so once again, able to use funding to do those kinds of things. So I think that we are trying to do everything we can to get the most vulnerable into housing, to make it quicker for people to be put in housing.

And then even with the partnership that I mentioned between health and DFSS, where we were trying to put dollars out the door to take full advantage of that eviction moratorium and keep people in their homes as long as possible. Right now, I feel like we're spending an awful lot of plates. I think that's fair.

Not saying we're doing anything that any of you all aren't doing. Everybody's working overtime. I am concerned about a surge.

And so I've also been paying close attention to even things like the accessory dwelling units conversation. I just think that in Chicago, we have to do everything we can to try to make sure that there are as many creative approaches as possible. And some of that includes trying to keep people from coming into housing, I mean, coming into homelessness, and it includes trying to get people out.

One of the things the mayor did recently is she wrote a letter to landlords, asking landlords to sort of step up and identify themselves and let us know if they were willing to partner with us around any of these housing initiatives that would get homeless individuals housed quicker. So we need housing and we need affordable housing. Otherwise, as I have said many, many times to you all individually, when you call me and you ask me to send somebody out because you've got an encampment in your ward, we come.

But if I don't have any place to put people, what I'm doing is moving them from one side of the street to the other. And there's a point where that's just not effective.

[Speaker 1] (1:16:12 - 1:16:58)
Okay, before we get into, wait, before we get further questioning from Alderman Haddon, I just wanna emphasize, we have 100 people on this call for zoning initiatives. There is a health committee and there's a housing committee where we could talk ad infinitum about the crisis that we're here. So I just wanna bring everyone's attention.

I wanna keep as many members as I can on the zoning issue. For the benefit of the zoning members, this is not a zoning change. This is a temporary change of use at the above sites.

So I just wanted to keep on the line engaged, but we're not gonna solve COVID this morning. So Maria, you wanna ask your question?

[Speaker 34] (1:16:58 - 1:17:14)
Sure, I was only gonna thank Commissioner Morrison Butler and Chairman, it is unfortunate as a member of the Health and Human Relations Committee and also of Housing. It's just, they're such exciting topics.

[Speaker 9] (1:17:15 - 1:17:17)
I'm with you, I'm with you, Maria.

[Speaker 34] (1:17:18 - 1:17:40)
But Commissioner, thank you. And I was just gonna say, it would be great. I know my colleague Alderman Lopez mentioned kind of more briefings.

I'll reach out directly, but it would be great to hear more as we enter this season into what, so thank you for being here and thank you, Chair.

[Speaker 1] (1:17:41 - 1:17:42)
All right, Chairman Dowell.

[Speaker 31] (1:17:43 - 1:18:19)
Yes, hey, Chairman Tony. I just wanted to take the opportunity since I'm here and Commissioner Butler is here just to thank you, Commissioner, for the very effective and quick response to a homeless person that was in my ward this weekend, that was a real big issue. And your staff working with the police department in the first district really took care of it in short order.

So I just wanted to thank you while I had the opportunity. Thank you for indulging me, Chairman. Move on.

[Speaker 1] (1:18:21 - 1:18:33)
Chairman Tony, I would think. All right, if there are no further questions by committee members, do I hear a motion? Do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

[Speaker 34] (1:18:33 - 1:18:34)
So moved, Alderman Hatton.

[Speaker 1] (1:18:35 - 1:18:49)
Alderman Hatton moves to do pass. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Thank you, Commissioner Morrison-Butler for your continued dedication to our city and to our most vulnerable. Thank you.

[Speaker 2] (1:18:49 - 1:18:50)
Thank you, Chair.

[Speaker 1] (1:18:53 - 1:19:32)
Okay, now we're going back. Okay, now we're going back to the first item on the addendum to the agenda. That's mayoral application 2006.

Amendment of the municipal code section 1713-0610 regarding plan development ordinance review processes and fees. We have zoning administrator, Patrick Murphy and Steve Valenciano from DPD here to testify on the matter and answer any questions. Patrick Murphy or Steve.

[Speaker 37] (1:19:33 - 1:19:33)
Yes, I'm sorry.

[Speaker 1] (1:19:34 - 1:19:40)
Okay, Patrick, you're on the plan development review processes and fees.

[Speaker 26] (1:19:42 - 1:19:46)
Noah Sofranik from DPD is here. He's got a script and he's ready for the briefing. Sorry, sir.

[Speaker 9] (1:19:47 - 1:19:51)
All right, Noah. Hello, can you guys hear me? Good morning, everyone.

[Speaker 1] (1:19:52 - 1:19:53)
Identify yourself in the records, please.

[Speaker 9] (1:19:54 - 1:23:34)
Good morning, chairman and members of committee for the record. Noah Sofranik with the Department of Planning and Development. I'm here today to give you a brief synopsis of this item before you today.

As the chairman mentioned, it's to amend section 1713-0610, the Chicago Zoning Ordinance, specifically as it pertains to the collection of plan development with new fees. So some specific details for this ordinance amendment. It's a proposal that affects projects citywide.

The proposed changes would not affect the actual fee structure. All the required fees and payments remain as stated. The proposed change would only affect plan developments that are submitted to the department, which would include multiple phases of development in their proposal.

And if multiple phases are included, would also require that those subsequent phases have a site plan approval requirement written in and attached to them in order to be eligible to defer the timing of payment. So the previous rule as put into the ordinance in January of 2020 of this year, required projects that come in for plan development when they apply to pay 50% of their plan development review fee upfront as part of their filing. As we moved on in the first few months, no, sorry.

As we moved on in the first few months of the year, we started to see examples of development where we saw that there could be potential hurdles to development and potential issues on projects that had multiple different development teams involved with paying this fee upfront. So we had come up with this as an alternative method to keep development moving forward. And just to offer up a generic example of what would happen in these cases, say we had a plan development with four phases of development, each having an equal size of 100,000 square feet, cumulative total of 400,000 square feet.

Under the old rule, someone coming in or under the current rule, I should say, someone coming in to file that application would have to have a $100,000 filing fee presented just to file their application. So in this current proposed alternative rule, the applicant coming in, if they only have their first phase of development design, they would have a fee at the time of filing of $25,000. And then each of the three phases, as they came back to the department for review and approval through site plan approval, would then pay the additional $25,000 at each of those three points in time.

So the overall fee would remain as the $100,000, just stretched out over the life of the development rather than requiring it to all become upfront. And in the last few months, what was really striking is we had a plan development that is actually read as a deferred item today that would like to go to plan commission called West Haven. And they have an affordable housing development component that leaves some actual development rights in the plan development for later.

And they would have had to pay for all of those rights upfront. And the affordable housing developments are sometimes strapped for liquid. And in that scenario would make it very difficult for that project to get to the finish line.

So that is one of the examples that we have in front of you today as a practical example of what's holding, what could hold development back. So with that, I am here to answer any questions. I believe Patrick will also help me in answering those.

And Lucia if necessary.

[Speaker 1] (1:23:35 - 1:23:43)
Thank you. Thank you, Noah. I see a vice chair.

Roboius has a question. Ariel.

[Speaker 5] (1:23:44 - 1:23:58)
Thank you. Thank you, Noah for that presentation. So my question is, is this fee to be paid prior or to them receiving their desired zoning for that particular project?

[Speaker 9] (1:23:59 - 1:24:23)
So the way the rule is written today, it is part of their filing to request the zoning change to a plan development. In the modified request, they would have to pay a portion of whatever they have ready to go and design. And then there are required administrative steps in PD to keep them coming back so that the overall fee ends up getting paid.

It's just stretched out over a longer time.

[Speaker 5] (1:24:23 - 1:24:26)
Okay, I like that. Yeah, okay, thank you very much. Thank you, chairman.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:24:27 - 1:24:54)
I do not see any other hands up for questions. If there's no further questions by committee members, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? So moved Mr. Chairman. Vice chair Roboius moves to pass. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Thank you, Noah and the department on that one.

[Speaker 9] (1:24:54 - 1:24:56)
Thank you everyone. All right.

[Speaker 1] (1:25:05 - 1:26:47)
All right, moving on. We have large signs over a hundred square feet in area, 24 feet above grade. We will hear them all together.

I will read the ward followed by the address and take a motion at the end. In the first ward, 2585 North Elston Avenue. Also in the first ward, 2845 West Belden Avenue.

In the 25th ward, three signs at 1135 South Delano Court. In the 27th ward, 1460 North Halsted Street. In the 27th ward, 2327 West Madison Street.

In the 28th ward, 2415 West 19th Street. In the 39th ward, 4025 West Peterson Avenue. In the 42nd ward, 640 North Wells.

In the 42nd ward, 311 West Monroe. Also in the 42nd ward, two signs at 110 North Wacker. In the 42nd ward, two signs at 405 North Wabash.

And finally in the 47th ward, 1801 West Argyle. Questions by committee members? Hearing none, do I have a motion do pass for these items by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 5] (1:26:47 - 1:26:49)
Alderman Lopez moves, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:26:50 - 1:26:58)
Alderman Lopez moves to pass. Any objections? Hearing none, these items are passed.

[Speaker 25] (1:27:00 - 1:27:00)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (1:27:04 - 1:28:36)
Now as a benefit, I should say, we're gonna go out of order for Alderman Scott and a number of witnesses that were on the call. For those of you following along on the reformatted agenda, it is in the middle of page 10, file number 20406. If you are looking at the traditional deferred agenda, you can find it on page 13.

All right, so let me read for the record. Item number 20406, 24th ward. Ordinance was referred on May 20th of 2020.

Common address, 1111 through 1141, South Holman Avenue, 1134 through 1142, South Kedzie Avenue, 3300 to 3303 West Fillmore Street, 3200 through 3340 West Roosevelt Road. Change request, business plan development number 177 to business plan development 177 as amended. We have our attorney, Graham Grady.

Graham, I'm gonna tell you up front, we got a long agenda and I know you can be wordy at times. So let's get to the point. This is a very exciting project for Alderman Scott.

We wanna give him more time than you. Okay, so Graham.

[Speaker 40] (1:28:58 - 1:28:59)
Man, that was short.

[Speaker 37] (1:28:59 - 1:29:06)
I'm sorry, Chairman. I don't have Graham on the call. I have Sylvia Micas from Taft and there may be some others on this list.

[Speaker 1] (1:29:06 - 1:29:10)
Let's go with Sylvia. Let's make sure that she can speak up.

[Speaker 32] (1:29:10 - 1:29:11)
Can I get in?

[Speaker 1] (1:29:12 - 1:29:12)
Sylvia.

[Speaker 4] (1:29:13 - 1:29:14)
Can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (1:29:14 - 1:29:32)
I don't know if- Sylvia Micas, we're here to talk about the North Lawndale project. As I said to Graham and I'm gonna tell you, we've got a lot of items on the agenda today. And I know this is a very exciting project for Alderman Scott.

We wanna hear from him more than we wanna hear from you. Okay, so proceed.

[Speaker 4] (1:29:34 - 1:30:11)
Good morning, members of the committee. I'm here today on behalf of North Lawndale Employment Network. With me today are Brenda Palms-Barber, Executive Director for North Lawndale and also Larry Kearns, the Principal with Wheeler Kearns Architects.

First, we'd like to thank Alderman Scott and the staff of the Department of Planning and Development and all that have contributed to this project. First, I would like to request the record from the August 20th Plan Commission hearing to be entered into the Committee on Zoning Record. Just going very quickly- We do that.

[Speaker 1] (1:30:12 - 1:30:20)
Alderman Raboyas moves to incorporate the records from the Plan Commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

[Speaker 3] (1:30:22 - 1:30:22)
So moved.

[Speaker 1] (1:30:23 - 1:30:25)
Hearing none, the records are incorporated. Proceed, Sylvia.

[Speaker 4] (1:30:26 - 1:35:50)
The subject property is located at 111 South Pullman. It will become the new home of the North Lawndale Employment Network and its subsidiary, Sweet Beginnings, LLC. That's 48,000 square foot property was purchased by NLEN last May and is located in the North Lawndale community.

This project is located within an area identified by the city under the Invest Southwest Community Reinvestment Initiative. We have been approved or NLEN has been approved for a $2.5 million NOF grant. The application calls for amending PD-177 in order to add the following uses.

Outdoor urban farm, rooftop operation, processing and packaging of honey material generated at and brought to the site from Offsite Apiaries, a community center which will be named in honor of Michael Scott Senior Community Room and a drive-through banking facility facilitated and operated by Wintrust. In terms, as you can see here, the PD boundaries, we are bounded by obviously Kenzie in the North and then we have Pullman on the South, Fillmore on the West and Roosevelt on the East. This is a very large PD.

We are a small part of that, obviously as you can see on the attached map. The current zoning is PD-177. We are proposing to rezone to PD-177 as amended.

Just to give a little bit of a quick background about what is contained in the PD itself, if we could switch to the land use contacts please. Obviously our property is vacant. It is an existing two-story building.

It is the former home of Liberty Bank. Also there is a McDonald's, a Leamington Foods, Comcast facility all within this PD. Switching over to the site plan review.

That is our overall site. And then the next slide is the proposed site and landscaping plan where you can see where landscaping features will be added. Moving on to actually the Worker Bee Cafe.

This is one of the highlights of this proposed development. This is the Worker Bee Cafe, which will be managed and operated by Sweet Beginnings, one of the very important job training programs of North Lawndale Employment Network. Moving on to the next slide is the Peace Garden slide.

Next slide please, thank you. This is an area where everyone can go in terms of the employees, et cetera, and enjoy a nice honey infused cup of tea to enjoy outside. This is directly off of the Michael Scott Senior Community Center.

Moving on to the next side, first floor plan. I think you will see the tenant space for Wintrust will operate. Also the core of NLEN's operations.

Moving on to the next slide. This is our prep kitchen. This is where Sweet Beginnings will work on processing the honey from the apiaries, which will be located on top, on the roof top of the building, as well as been brought in offsite to make the wonderful honey infused products and also the skincare products, which are sold underneath the Bee Love brand.

Again, this is yet another one of the job training programs that NLEN has. Moving on to the, this is the community room. Again, named in honor of Michael Scott Jr. And going to the next slide, please. Second floor plan. This is primarily administrative offices for NLEN, some conference center, job training areas, et cetera. Moving on to the next plan, please.

The roof plan, obviously showing our rooftop apiary, which will contain five beehives. Okay, next slide, please. In terms of summarizing the community meeting process, we had dates of the community meetings in January of 2019, and also January of 2020.

Unanimous community support. Next slide, please. This is kind of our crown and jewel here.

In terms of NBEWB compliance, we are, our NLEN is already on the books, has 46% participation from NBE, 9% from WBE, 71 permanent jobs, 105 construction jobs, and a $6.5 million project budget. The project timeline, basically construction has begun. At this point, if we have time, Chairman Tunney, I don't know if we do, but I would like just a very short, short statement from Brenda Palms Barber, who, again, is the executive director and is the heart and soul of NLEN, if we have a few moments.

[Speaker 1] (1:35:51 - 1:35:59)
Okay, we will let Brenda on, but just like the other public speaker, three minutes. Brenda, for three minutes.

[Speaker 30] (1:36:00 - 1:37:52)
Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. I will, I'll probably be less than that.

What I want to say is that this workforce campus is going to reduce the unemployment rate in North Lawndale by 10% by 2023. And so you may think that's a bold goal, but right now, these times require bold action. We are, it's enough for us to have a low, a high unemployment rate in North Lawndale to begin with, but truly you know that through the conversations you've had that this pandemic has truly revealed to us the level of vulnerability and the need for new jobs and opportunities for prosperity in our community.

So this campus represents hope, but it's also an economic engine. We're excited about inviting you to come out and have a cup of Worker B honey infused lattes with us. We could not do this work without the support and visionary leadership of our alderman, Michael Scott.

We are thrilled and honored to recognize his father for the services that he provided, not just North Lawndale, but really the entire city of Chicago. So we also, as we mentioned, we'll be able to increase our visibility as an organization because we're currently in five different locations and now the community will know where we are and how to receive those support services. We'll increase our employment, our employees from 55 to 71.

And we'll be able to serve basically double the number of people that we serve currently. So that means moving from 2000 people to 5,000 people. We are excited to be the premier workforce development organization in North Lawndale to move people, not just from hope to reality in terms of their own self sufficiency and our self worth as a neighborhood.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:37:54 - 1:38:24)
Thank you, Brenda. And as a member of the planning commission, I was very impressed with the whole team and the work that you're doing in West Lawndale or North Lawndale. I'm gonna ask Alderman Scott, since it's in your ward, Alderman Scott.

Thank you. Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Let me go back.

Sylvia, are you finished with your presentation?

[Speaker 4] (1:38:25 - 1:38:27)
Yes, thank you very much, Chairman Tunney.

[Speaker 1] (1:38:27 - 1:38:30)
Okay, wanna make sure that. Okay, Alderman Michael Scott.

[Speaker 15] (1:38:34 - 1:40:02)
Thank you, Chair. And thank you members of the committee. It is a privilege and an honor to be able to support an organization like North Lawndale Employment Network.

You heard from Brenda Palms Barber, who I consider a partner in the good work that we're doing in North Lawndale. Like she mentioned, they're in five locations doing the good work currently. To bring all of the organization's members and all of the work that they're doing under one central location in the heart of North Lawndale, I think just exponentially increases the work that they're going to be able to do.

Brenda often talks about decreasing the employment rate by 10% in North Lawndale. And I often tease her that she's gonna do more than that. She's gonna be about 15% because of the hard work that she does and the excellent staff that she has.

You've heard from members of my community who talked about how the support is overwhelming for this organization. And that is because they walk the walk and they talk the talk and they walk the walk. Again, it is an honor and a privilege to be able to support them.

And I ask the members of the committee to be supportive of this as well. It is going to be a great thing for North Lawndale. It is going to reduce, the unemployment rate is going to reduce recidivism and it's going to give us a great place to hang out and drink honey infused lattes and coffees and teas.

And again, I ask for the support of committee. Thank you, Mr. Chair.

[Speaker 1] (1:40:03 - 1:40:10)
Thank you, Michael. First up, Alderman Ray Lopez, questions or comments for the project?

[Speaker 5] (1:40:13 - 1:40:48)
Thank you, Chairman. And first and foremost, congratulations to our colleague Alderman Michael Scott and to the North Lawndale community on this wonderful addition to the neighborhood. I just had one question with regards to the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund.

I believe it was said that it's a $2.5 million grant that is being awarded. Alderman and or Chairman, do we know if the appropriate council committees has already voted on awarding of this grant or is that something that will be coming up as well?

[Speaker 15] (1:40:49 - 1:41:30)
Can I speak to that, Chair? Alderman Michael Scott, on the question. Thank you again, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Alderman Lopez. This is, they applied for Neighborhood Opportunity Fund in the last administration. They were awarded earlier this year.

So that is not something that needs to come back before council. It has already been approved. Again, I think it is very fortuitous that the last administration and this administration saw the good work that North Lawndale Employment Network does and will continue to do in North Lawndale and was fortunate enough to award that grant to the community organization.

[Speaker 5] (1:41:34 - 1:41:48)
Alderman Lopez. Okay, thank you, Chairman. I was just under the impression that grants of a certain size had to be voted on, but if the money's already been guaranteed and the check's been written, then all the best.

[Speaker 15] (1:41:48 - 1:42:11)
It was voted on already, Alderman. It came before council earlier this year. It was voted on.

It was not something that was cashed and it was voted on already. So I can't remember exactly, but it was earlier this year, maybe the end of last year. I can't remember exactly, but it has been- It has been voted on by the Finance Committee.

[Speaker 1] (1:42:12 - 1:42:18)
That answers the question, right? Okay, great. All right, next, Vice Chair Roboyas.

[Speaker 5] (1:42:19 - 1:42:33)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First of all, I want to say thank you and I'm very impressed with this beautiful project. Yes, Alderman Scott, I just wanted to- Hello, sorry.

Still there? Alderman Roboyas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 3] (1:42:33 - 1:42:51)
I want to congratulate the North Lawndale Employment Network and in particular, I want to commend Alderman Michael Scott for not only this exciting project, but to name it after someone who I worked with, someone who cared about his community, cared about the city as a whole.

[Speaker 5] (1:42:51 - 1:42:58)
I think it's a wonderful project and I congratulate you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:42:58 - 1:43:01)
Next, Alderman Michael Rodriguez. Mike.

[Speaker 33] (1:43:02 - 1:43:53)
Thank you, Chairman. It's an absolute pleasure to see this project being presented today. I want to congratulate our colleague, Alderman Scott, for the hard work on this.

To Brenda Palms Barber, for someone that I have the extensive pleasure of partnering with and working with in a previous life and who I stood on 26th Street with not too long ago, speaking to the efforts of building bridges between communities, most notably the Little Village community and the North Lawndale community. I want to congratulate you both in this effort. My community will benefit from this effort as well.

I'm certain of it. And I wanted to congratulate you once again. Thank you, Chairman, for the time.

Alderman Pat Dowell.

[Speaker 31] (1:43:53 - 1:44:40)
Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I wanted to congratulate Alderman Scott. It's great to see this old bank building come back to life.

Certainly will add some life to the area. I wanted to also congratulate Brenda. I'm amazed at how you have built this organization and this work from the little white bee box that used to sit by the embankment to a full-fledged industry.

So congratulations. And again, Alderman Scott, congratulations on making this happen.

[Speaker 1] (1:44:41 - 1:44:43)
Thank you, Alderman. Alderman Carrie Austin.

[Speaker 9] (1:44:46 - 1:45:28)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I too want to congratulate Alderman Scott, but additionally to congratulate you on the naming of the building in honor of your father, of someone that have dedicated his life to the city of Chicago and especially to Lawndale. But for this to come to fruition after such a long time of North Lawndale not receiving any benefits from the city, this is something that you can be proud of for eternity.

Congratulations, Alderman Scott.

[Speaker 17] (1:45:31 - 1:45:32)
All right.

[Speaker 3] (1:45:33 - 1:45:34)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:45:34 - 1:47:07)
Thank you, Alderman. All right, I don't see any other hands up. Alderman Michael Scott, you know how I feel about your father and his commitment to the city.

And I think it's fitting in the naming opportunity for North Lawndale to come back under your leadership as the Alderman there. So there are no more questions by committee members. Do I hear a motion?

Do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine- Alderman Beal moves to pass. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed as revised.

Thank you, Mr. Chair and members of the committee. Thank you so much. All right, now we're going to page three on the agenda in the 40s.

Well, it's in the 47th Ward, document number 20459-T1, 47th Ward. Ordinance was referred on July 22nd of 2020. Common address 3419 through 3421 North Paulina Street.

Change request, B12 Neighborhood Shopping District and RS3 Residential Single Unit Detached House District to a B23 Neighborhood Mixed Use District. We have Sarah Barnes as the attorney on this application.

[Speaker 6] (1:47:09 - 1:49:30)
Hello, good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Sarah Barnes and I'm an attorney with the Losses of Sam Banks located at 221 Northwest South Street. I'm happy to be here this morning on behalf of the applicant, Paulina Plath, LLC, who owns the subject property.

The subject property is currently split zoned between a residential and a business zoning classification because it is comprised of two contiguous zoning lots. The applicant is seeking to redevelop the site in its entirety with a new four-story all-residential multi-unit building that will contain a total of 14 dwelling units between the first through fourth floors. There is a nice mix of sizes for those dwelling units.

They range from size studio up to two bedroom units. And we have been working very closely with Alderman Martin as well as the 47th Ward Zoning Advisory Committee towards actually providing additional affordable units above and beyond the 10% that is required under the Affordable Requirements Ordinance that has all been memorialized by and through Alderman Martin's office. As well and towards those same ends, the subject property is located directly across the street from the CTA Brown Line entrance.

And as a result, this site qualifies and meets the very definition of a transit serve location. So in order to mitigate congestion in the area, vehicular congestion, we are limiting the parking or asking for a reduction in the parking from 14 parking spaces down to four. This particular developer actually has a very similar building on Damon Avenue and they have not utilized any of their parking and they have the same parking ratio.

So we do believe that that is going to be consistent at this site. We've met again with Alderman Martin, the 47th Ward Zoning Advisory Committee, as well as the Lakeview Chamber of Commerce to present this plan. And as of today, we do have the support of all of the organizations as well as Alderman Martin, who I believe, Mr. Chairman, tendered a copy of a letter of support to your office.

[Speaker 1] (1:49:31 - 1:49:37)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Martin, but my understanding is there's a, is there a substitute?

[Speaker 6] (1:49:38 - 1:49:58)
Just getting there. I'm sorry, I should have led with that. Yes, Mr. Chairman, in voting on this proposal, we did tender a substitute narrative along with a substitute set of plans to the Department of Planning and Development. So we would ask that those get incorporated into the record here today and any votes be taken in consideration of the same.

[Speaker 3] (1:49:59 - 1:50:01)
So move on to test substitute.

[Speaker 1] (1:50:01 - 1:50:20)
All right, Alderman Raboios moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that? Hearing none, the substitute narrative and plans are accepted.

Sarah, is your testimony complete now?

[Speaker 6] (1:50:21 - 1:50:23)
It is, I'm happy to answer questions though.

[Speaker 1] (1:50:23 - 1:50:36)
Yep, so I don't see any hands up from committee members. So in the hearing, no questions, can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 40] (1:50:37 - 1:50:38)
Alderman Dowell moves to pass.

[Speaker 1] (1:50:39 - 1:50:52)
Alderman Dowell moves to pass. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed as revised.

I'm sorry, item is passed with the substitute narrative and plans. Thank you very much.

[Speaker 6] (1:50:52 - 1:50:53)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:50:53 - 1:50:54)
All right.

[Speaker 6] (1:50:54 - 1:50:56)
I think I have the next one.

[Speaker 1] (1:50:56 - 1:51:22)
All right, then we will announce the next item and that is number 20456, 47th Ward. Ordinance was referred on July 22nd of 2020. The common address, 2445 West Pensacola Avenue and the change request, RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RM4.5 residential multi-unit district. Sarah, would you proceed?

[Speaker 6] (1:51:23 - 1:54:05)
Thank you again, Mr. Chairman and once more members of the committee. For the record, once more, my name is Sarah Barnes. I'm an attorney with the Law Offices of Sam Banks located at 221 Northwest South Street.

Happy to be here this morning on behalf of the applicants, Jeffrey and Jennifer Delgren. The Delgren's own the subject property which is currently improved with a two and a half story or a two story with a garden basement which means the basement is actually more than 50% above grade. All residential building, the building presently contains a total of three dwelling units, all of which are occupied by either young couples or starter families, including the Delgren's who live in one of the units with their new son.

The Delgren's have lived at this particular property for over 20 years. And instead of growing their family in a larger home or having to move out to the suburbs, they are seeking to actually rehabilitate and renovate the existing three unit building which is non-conforming under the current zoning ordinance. And their proposal calls for a rear addition.

What that will allow is for the Delgren's to add a bathroom as well as an office and or additional bedroom to each of the units because as I mentioned, all of the units are currently occupied by families that live within the 47th board in light of the current COVID limitations and life altering changes that we've all had to make as a result of the same. The Delgren's both work from home and as well are having to homeschool their child as well as the additional, the other families in the building. So again, as a result of those conditions and just in order to maintain the building and also allow families another option when they are kind of cost prohibited from buying a single family home within the same ward, the proposal calls for that rear addition in order to permit the construction of the rear addition.

However, we do need to bring the building in its entirety into compliance under the current zoning ordinance which requires the proposed underlying zoning change. So we have met with the, again, Alderman Martin, the 47th Ward Zoning Advisory Committee as well as the Near North Neighbors Association to present the proposal, all of whom again are in support of the programming as you have before you here today. So with that, we very respectfully request the support and approval of the committee.

Thank you.

[Speaker 27] (1:54:07 - 1:54:08)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:54:09 - 1:55:07)
Do we have any questions from committee members? Hearing none, do I get a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderman Austin moves do pass.

Alderman Austin moves do pass. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Thank you, Sarah. Now we're on the top of page four, also in the 47th Ward, document number 20455-T1. Ordinance was referred on July 22nd of 2020.

Common address is 4010, that's 4010 North Lincoln Avenue. The change request, a B11 Neighborhood Shopping District to a B33 Community Shopping District. Tom Moore is the attorney on this case.

Mr. Moore.

[Speaker 8] (1:55:08 - 1:55:10)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (1:55:10 - 1:55:11)
We can.

[Speaker 8] (1:55:11 - 1:56:12)
Thank you. This is a project that's gone through extensive community process in the 47th Ward. It is a COD project.

It has 16 dwelling units and eight efficiencies. And the ordinance would require two, affordables, but through the community process, they've added another two, which are documented through the local ward. So there's a total of four onsite affordable units.

And there'll be 11 onsite parking stalls. We, as I say, there were repeated articles in the repeated meetings with both the community and the Aldermen, and we have the support of Alderman Martin, and we request your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (1:56:17 - 1:56:33)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Martin. Questions by committee members? Okay, no hands are up.

So can I get a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 13] (1:56:34 - 1:56:35)
So moved, Alderman Cardona.

[Speaker 1] (1:56:36 - 1:57:18)
Alderman Cardona moves do pass. Any objections? Hearing none, and the item is passed.

Now we'll move to the middle of page four, number 20453, 27th Ward. Ordinance was referred on July 22nd, 2020. Common address, 1446 West Huron Street.

The change request from an RT3.5 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district, an RT4 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district. Again, we have Tom Moore as the attorney, Mr. Moore.

[Speaker 8] (1:57:19 - 1:58:29)
Yes, thank you. This is a single family home. We had a community Zoom meeting where the Alderman had us send out a notice to 500 feet around.

We had a lot of support and no objections. Alderman Burnett participated in the meeting and asked the participants questions. And as I say, there was support for it.

This is a family that where the husband, where the couple has had two children recently. And the gentleman has moved his mother from a war torn country in the Middle East. And they needed the extra two rooms on top of the building.

And in order to do that, we needed to go up a half a point from a three, five to a four. And as I say, we have both the community and the Alderman's support and we'd request your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (1:58:30 - 1:58:38)
Thank you. I know Alderman Burnett is on the call. Alderman Burnett, on the item, please.

[Speaker 3] (1:58:39 - 1:59:08)
Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. So as the counselor said, they did go to the local community organization, which in this case, if I'm not mistaken, is the Echo Park Community Council. Echo Park Community Council approved this.

We did have a Zoom community meeting. All it is is an existing neighbor trying to get more space so they can stay in the community. Everyone that was on the Zoom meeting supported.

I supported, I asked for the committee support. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:59:11 - 1:59:22)
Thank you, Alderman. Any questions for the Alderman or the applicant or the attorneys for the applicant? Hearing none, can I get a motion?

Move to pass.

[Speaker 25] (1:59:24 - 1:59:25)
So moved.

[Speaker 1] (1:59:26 - 2:00:08)
Alderman- Yes, Cardona. Alderman Roboyes moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine the quorum. Do we have any objections?

Hearing none, the item is passed. All right, now we're document number, bottom of page four, document number 20449, 19, ordinance was referred on July 22nd of 2020. Common address, 2737 West 111th Street.

And the change request, a B11 neighborhood shopping district to a C22 motor vehicle related commercial district. Again, we have Mr. Moore to speak on the application. Mr. Moore.

[Speaker 8] (2:00:09 - 2:01:34)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. This is a vacant former kind of industrial property out on 111th Street. It's been vacant for some time.

Mr. The applicant, Dan Pappas and his company seeks to put their fence company there and also have another use in the front in order to have both uses and to allow them to have a storage yard for the fence company, they need the C2 zoning. We went to the 19th Ward Zoning Committee and had their support. We also sent out notice to everyone within a certain distance.

And we had a number of follow-up conversations with the immediate neighbors. And the applicant talked to each of them individually to make promises as to how we will run his operation. And we, at this point, we're aware of no objections.

We have supported both the community and the alderman and we'd request your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (2:01:36 - 2:01:50)
So we do have a letter of support from alderman Matt O'Shea. Questions for the applicant? No questions.

Do I have a, do I hear a motion to move do pass by the same roll call?

[Speaker 27] (2:01:52 - 2:01:53)
We have to pass Alderman Wiggins.

[Speaker 1] (2:01:54 - 2:02:38)
Alderman Wiggins moves do pass. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

All right. Now, again, we're going to move to the top of page five, document number 20073-T1, second ward. Ordinance was referred on July 24th of 19, common address 1162 North Milwaukee Avenue and the change request.

B32 community shopping district to a B23 neighborhood mixed use district. Mr. Moore, you get around town. You're in the second ward now.

You want to proceed on this application?

[Speaker 8] (2:02:39 - 2:02:51)
Yes, please. But may we first, we went through extensive changes on it and there is a substitute ordinance. May we move the substitute ordinance so we can move forward on that?

[Speaker 1] (2:02:52 - 2:03:01)
Let me check with the department. Patrick or Steve?

[Speaker 27] (2:03:04 - 2:03:09)
Yeah, we have no change. Let me check with Anna and I'll get back to you during his testimony, Chairman.

[Speaker 8] (2:03:12 - 2:03:18)
All right. In that case, would you want to pass it towards the end of the call and we could come back to it?

[Speaker 1] (2:03:21 - 2:03:23)
Yeah, why don't we hold it? Okay.

[Speaker 8] (2:03:24 - 2:03:24)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:03:24 - 2:04:05)
All right. As soon as we hear from the department, we'll get back to you. Okay, thank you.

All right. So we're holding on that item in the second ward and we're now moving to document number 20460 in the 27th ward. Ordinance was referred on July 22nd of 2020, common address 918 North Drake Avenue in the change request.

An RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RT4 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district. And we have, is it Max Kling on the line, Max?

[Speaker 37] (2:04:05 - 2:04:57)
Yes, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Max Kling, last name K-L-I-N-G on behalf of Abraham Serpa, who is the property owner at 918 North Drake Avenue here in Chicago.

We've submitted an application to propose a zoning change from RS3, which is the current zoning of the property to RT4 and the purpose of the rezoning is to comply with the proposed conversion from a residential two flat to three dwelling units by adding a garden unit. And the applicant and myself have met with Alderman Burnett, who has expressed his support for the project. And the applicant has also received a letter from the West Humboldt Park Development Council expressing their consent and approval for this project.

[Speaker 1] (2:04:59 - 2:05:02)
Thank you, Max. Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 3] (2:05:04 - 2:05:50)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. Abraham is a long-term resident in the community of one of our Latino residents, even though his name is Abraham. And he just want to utilize the basement in his building.

This kind of falls similar in line to what we're talking about with the new ordinance that we're proposing. He has to come and get a whole zoning change in order for this to happen, to hire lawyers, to do all these things just to utilize his basement in his building. He did meet with the West Humboldt Park Development Council.

He got their support. We had a community meeting. I support it.

I asked for the committee support also.

[Speaker 1] (2:05:51 - 2:05:59)
Questions by committee members. Do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 11] (2:06:00 - 2:06:02)
Alderman Hopkins moves to pass.

[Speaker 1] (2:06:02 - 2:06:44)
Alderman Hopkins moves to pass. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

All right, we're going to stay on that page and move back to the second ward with Mr. Moore. Can we have Mr. Moore on the line for the document number 20073-T1, the ordinance referred on July 24th of 19, the one at 1162 North Milwaukee Avenue. Mr. Moore. He's just- Okay, we do have the- Substitute. But let me read it into the record now.

[Speaker 14] (2:06:45 - 2:06:47)
Yeah, there's a substitute ordinance in.

[Speaker 1] (2:06:48 - 2:07:19)
There'll be two motions on this one. Alderman Raboyas moves to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. So move.

Any objections? Hearing none, the substitute is accepted. And then the second is a motion to accept the substantive narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Can I get a motion on that one?

[Speaker 23] (2:07:20 - 2:07:21)
Alderman Hopkins.

[Speaker 1] (2:07:22 - 2:07:38)
Alderman Hopkins moves on that one. Any objections to that? Hearing none, the substantive narrative plans are accepted.

Okay, Mr. Moore.

[Speaker 8] (2:07:38 - 2:08:45)
We have all the substitutes we need. Let's go. Thank you very much.

And thanks for straightening that out. This is a request to move to change the zoning from a B3-2 to a B2-3. It is within a very close distance, a couple hundred feet to the L stop.

And it's been a vacant lot for a long time. The, with Alderman Hopkins' support, we were able to do a vacation and take part of a very large sidewalk that was there to increase the viability of the site. And as a result, we now are asking to build six efficiency units and eight dwelling units on this site.

And there will be two affordable units on site. And we have both the support of the community and the alderman, and we'd request your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (2:08:47 - 2:08:50)
Alderman Hopkins, do you want to comment on this one?

[Speaker 37] (2:08:52 - 2:09:17)
Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman. We do have a letter of support on file. This matter was subject to an extensive community review.

We received a number of favorable comments, including a letter of support from the Community Neighborhood Association of Record. So we would request support for this item. It is a TOD development and it will help with the economic development in the community.

And I would urge a favorable vote on this matter. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:09:18 - 2:09:52)
Thank you, Alderman. We do, we have received your letter of support. We also know how much work you put into this, so appreciate the commentary.

All right, so questions by the alderman or the attorney? Okay, hearing none, do I have a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Do pass, Alderman Cardona.

Alderman Cardona moves do pass, any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed as substituted and with the substitute narrative and plans.

[Speaker 11] (2:09:55 - 2:09:56)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:09:56 - 2:10:42)
Passed, all right, thank you. All right, now we have item of page five, document number 20437, 27th Ward. Ordinance was referred on July 22nd of 2020.

Common address 200 through 208 West Chicago Avenue, 800 to 820 North Wells Street, 201 to 209 West Institute Place. Change request, residential business plan development number 1303 to DX7, and then to residential business plan development number 1303 as amended. We have Michael Esger on the call on this one, Michael.

[Speaker 35] (2:10:42 - 2:11:05)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. Michael Esger on behalf of the applicant 808 North Wells Devco LLC. And we are, as a preliminary matter, we went to the plan commission on August 20th, where the project was unanimously supported and we wanted to incorporate the record of those proceedings into this hearing today.

[Speaker 1] (2:11:09 - 2:11:15)
Alderman Roboius moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

[Speaker 26] (2:11:15 - 2:11:16)
So moved, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:11:17 - 2:11:22)
Any objections to that? Hearing none, the records are incorporated.

[Speaker 35] (2:11:23 - 2:12:34)
Michael. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So this is a technical amendment to allow hotel as a permitted use within the already approved, approximately one year ago, project.

We're looking at a rendering from last year's plan commission. And again, this is a, there's a renderings looking South on Wells Street at Chicago Avenue, the building, the previous one was looking North from Chicago and Wells. This is a 318 unit apartment building.

And the request was to add 44 hotel units. And to the extent that those units are added in the future, that would reduce the one for one, the residential units. Affordable stays the same.

The previous commitments on MBE local hiring all stay the same. And you're looking at the approved site plan, which went through quite a bit of work with the community and NUP, CDOT and the Alderman. We have support for this request and Alderman Burnett is on the line to comment.

[Speaker 1] (2:12:38 - 2:12:57)
Alderman Walter Burnett. This is for the benefit of the committee members. This is, in the public testimony, this is a different hotel on Wells.

This is South at Chicago. The other one is at North at Wells. So just wanted to clarify that for the committee members.

[Speaker 35] (2:12:58 - 2:12:58)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:12:58 - 2:12:59)
Walter.

[Speaker 3] (2:13:00 - 2:14:04)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. So as the council has said, this is a previous plan development that was approved by the community in the New North Unity program, which is a local community organization in coordination with several other community organizations in the area. They came back to change it to allow for some of the hotel rooms to be used inside the building.

They're gonna keep, which is great about this and what the community like, is they still are gonna keep the same amount of affordable housing in the building, even though they're building less units of housing. They're adding hotels to it. The New North Unity program was happy about that at the community meeting.

Of course, I like that. So the community support this proposed development. I support it and I ask for the committee support.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:14:05 - 2:14:32)
Questions for the applicant or Walter Burnett, Alderman Burnett. So moved. Alderman Ravois makes a motion move, do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, this item is passed as revised.

[Speaker 35] (2:14:32 - 2:14:33)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:14:34 - 2:16:08)
Now for the benefit of the committee members, we are now moving on to item number 20436, 27th Ward ordinance was referred on July 22nd of 2020. This common address is 1520 through 1532 North Wells and 1513 through 1525 North Wieland. Change request, plan development 1335 and RM5, residential multi-unit district to plan development 1335 as amended.

And again, for the benefit of the committee members, we had probably three or four public comments on this, not in support. And I think you had some of the objections in your packets that was distributed to the committee. There was a petition, I believe of 600, which was from a number of years ago that were opposed to it from the beginning.

And those were in 2016? 2015 and 16. 2015 and 16.

Then we had 30, I believe additional emails currently as the design changes to this project. So with that being said, we have Katrina McGuire as the attorney for the applicant.

[Speaker 19] (2:16:09 - 2:16:40)
Good afternoon, chairman, county members of the committee. Katrina McGuire here from Thompson Coburn on behalf of the applicant Wells LLC. We have members of the development team with us here today too.

I'll go through a brief introduction and in light of the hour, I'll leave it at that. But of course we're all available to answer any and all questions that you might have. This matter was heard by the planning commission on August 20th, 2020.

And so therefore we would ask that the record of those proceedings be incorporated here today.

[Speaker 1] (2:16:41 - 2:17:26)
Okay. So Alderman Cardona moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, the records are incorporated. Thank you. Katrina, before you proceed, just for the benefit of the committee members, this application is a change to the plan development that fundamentally has issues with the parking pad or the change.

So I think what we're discussing today is an amendment to that PD. The size and basic structure of the hotel was approved in 2016, if I'm not correct.

[Speaker 19] (2:17:26 - 2:18:02)
That's correct, Mr. Chairman, that's exactly right. The original PD was approved back in June, 2016 with a 150 foot tall hotel. The hotel as presented here today is still a 150 foot tall hotel.

That initial PD included four single family homes along Wheeland. And at that time, a unique parking configuration was contemplated whereby there were no curb cuts on Wheeland and the single family homes that fronted Wheeland were going to access their parking, essentially from wells underneath the hotel, which ultimately was found to not work.

[Speaker 1] (2:18:03 - 2:18:10)
We then- I didn't mean to interrupt you, but I just wanted, and you can make your presentation, but I just wanted to know what we are actually voting on today.

[Speaker 19] (2:18:11 - 2:19:09)
It is an amendment to the PD to change essentially the site plan of the plan development. And I believe it's the next exhibit you'll see the comparison really of the two plans, the footprint of the hotel and then the single family homes to the rear. We've also added an additional lot to the north on Wheeland that's been incorporated as part of the plan development, which will be developed as a single family home.

There will be now two single family homes along Wheeland versus the four and the parking for the hotel is now no longer underground. It is in a parking garage to the rear of the hotel. There have been some design enhancements to the hotel.

The room count did increase from 190 to 203, but it is still a 150 foot, 151 foot hotel that fronts on Wells and is only accessed from Wells. There is no hotel access from Wheeland at all.

[Speaker 1] (2:19:11 - 2:19:42)
Okay. So just for the edification of the committee members, the proposals you're seeing are from Wheeland and we see that three or four homes, whatever that number is that seem to me from the plan commission, other than their shorter lots, seem to be consistent with what the single family home environment is on Wheeland. Is that correct?

[Speaker 19] (2:19:44 - 2:19:57)
Yeah, that's exactly right. That as approved is on your right side of your screen and on the left is what's proposed here today, which is flip two homes, but they will still be fronting on Wheeland.

[Speaker 1] (2:20:00 - 2:20:03)
Continue Katrina, continue.

[Speaker 19] (2:20:04 - 2:20:07)
That's all we have for the presentation, but we're happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (2:20:08 - 2:20:13)
All right, let's hear from Alderman Burnett and then we'll open up for questions.

[Speaker 3] (2:20:16 - 2:20:35)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. You got to excuse me. I'm on another zone meeting.

This stuff is crazy with the black caucus. That's probably why most of the black caucus is not at your meeting because we own the meetings talking about cannabis stuff. But anyway, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:20:35 - 2:20:37)
No samples at that meeting, right?

[Speaker 3] (2:20:38 - 2:27:16)
No, not at all. Mr. Chairman, this is one of my unique communities. I have a lot of great people here.

You know, I've been, I grew up near this area and worked this area for over 25 years. For 25 years, I worked with people to help increase the value of this community. One time, Old Town was not that great of a place.

They didn't have the 1 million, 2 million, 3 million or more houses in this community, right? So, you know, so now I find myself in the middle of people with a lot of money who don't like each other at these meetings, which is unique, but it's all right. So initially we had a meeting about the hotel in 2016.

We did have a meeting in 2016 and people did disapprove the hotel in 2016. And I made the developer go back to the table and go back to the drawing board and then come back. And then it got approved, but nobody wanted to mention that.

And then we had a meeting for this proposed revision. And we had a meeting for this proposed revision. I had a whole bunch of people at this meeting, most of which did not live in the community.

People who was against it went and got folks from their kids' schools to come and all types of people to come to the meeting to object with them. And I felt like I was being gang banged on and they humiliated me so bad, which was terrible and accused me of gonna approve it anyway. And I made the developer go back to the table.

And I literally made the developer go back to the table and go back to the community and work on the development. And from that, the developer went and changed some things. He actually offered to put a park there, right?

He offered to put a park where the houses was. And some folks didn't want the park. Some folks that was on the call earlier are concerned because they have an Airbnb business and they don't want it to compete with their Airbnb.

I'm dealing with a lot of drama with this situation, but we try to always, we try to separate the drama from really what's going on. And of course, yeah, I've been Alderman for 25 years. I have a relationship with a lot of people in my ward.

And over the years you develop relationships with people after 25 years of representing them. But anyway, so the developer went to the table, he went and met with the community. Some folks didn't want the park.

Some folks didn't want certain things. Planning didn't want certain things. So the developer reconstructed it.

And this is what he came up with. And this was the compromise for planning and for the community. We still have a nice, nice houses.

Granted, if you look at this, it looks nice now, but this used to be on Well Street. It was O'Brien's Restaurant, which was nice. But right behind there on Wheeling Street, it was a parking lot.

It was a parking lot for over 20, over 25 years since I've been Alderman. This was a parking lot that you now putting houses on and it's gonna enhance this block. It's nice.

It is in the same context of the other houses on the block. There are other people who approved this that's on the block on Wheeling Street. I have several of them to have emailed me.

And you have a couple of people and they have some personal things going on who don't like this. I'm not into the personal stuff. I'm not into people's personal things with each other.

I'm into dealing with and being objective about these things and trying to deal with what I think is the majority of the support for this project. So with that, with the developer, and also the Old Town Merchants-in-Residence recused themselves. Generally how I deal with developments in this community, I've been dealing with the Old Town Merchants-in-Residence for 25 years.

This is the first time they've recused themselves, or second time when the first hotel, and now this one. They recused themselves from the development because it would have been unethical for them to give input. So they were very honorable about it.

They recused themselves and we did have a community meeting. Now made the developer go door to door on Wheeling Street to work this thing out. I made them work for this.

And they came up with a lot of compromises and this is what they came up with, and it's beautiful. Granted, you did have curb cuts on Wheeling Street already. Wheeling Street is one of those streets where you don't have alleys.

So most places have to have curb cuts on these streets because there's no alley. Matter of fact, they actually emptied a garbage on Wheeling Street. The garbage man had to drive down the street, empty the garbage on Wheeling Street because they don't have any alleys.

These guys made less alleys, less curb cuts on the block. They took a parking lot and they're getting ready to build some beautiful buildings. The hotel didn't go up any higher.

The property owners on Wells Street, which are a lot of business owners who still live in the community, they want the hotel because they don't have enough support from the community for their businesses to survive, especially now in this economy. And they need the out-of-town money to come to the community in order to help keep that street vibrant and keep those businesses in place. So, Mr. Chairman, I'm in support of this from the emails that I got and from my determination from the meetings, there are people who are in support of this and deciphering through the personal stuff. I see this as a proposal that the community, most of the people in the community chose to live with and I ask for the committee's support.

[Speaker 1] (2:27:18 - 2:27:58)
Thank you, Alderman Burnett. Do we have questions from committee members? I just have one question just for the record.

Katrina or the Alderman, there was a public speaker that talked about traffic. And many of us know that Wells and North Avenue is a very congested intersection as we speak. What was the traffic recommendations and how will it impact our neighbors on Wheeland?

It doesn't seem to me that there's... Tell me about that, because that was obviously brought up in the public comment period.

[Speaker 19] (2:27:58 - 2:28:17)
Yeah, so a full traffic study was conducted at the time of the hotel approval. A new one was not conducted for purposes of this amendment because there was really no material change to the hotel, which was potentially the traffic generator. So, again...

[Speaker 1] (2:28:17 - 2:28:23)
All access is from Wells, so there's no way... That's correct. There's...

[Speaker 19] (2:28:24 - 2:28:31)
All the loading, all the valet services, all of the parking for the hotel is all accessed off of Wells, not from Wheeland at all.

[Speaker 40] (2:28:32 - 2:28:32)
Okay.

[Speaker 19] (2:28:35 - 2:28:36)
Any other questions?

[Speaker 1] (2:28:38 - 2:28:46)
I don't see any hands up. Can I get a motion to move, do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 40] (2:28:49 - 2:28:49)
So moved.

[Speaker 1] (2:28:51 - 2:29:06)
Alderman Raboyas moves to pass on the item. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed as revised.

As revised. Thank you.

[Speaker 19] (2:29:07 - 2:29:12)
Okay. Thank you. All right.

Now we're... Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:29:13 - 2:29:39)
Middle of page six, document number 20447, 26th Ward, ordinance was referred on July 22nd of 2020. Common address, 2109 West Grand Avenue. The change request, C32, Commercial Manufacturing and Employment District to C22, Motor Vehicle Related Commercial District.

We have the attorney, Dean Maragos, on this application. Dean?

[Speaker 28] (2:29:49 - 2:30:46)
Dean Maragos. Can you hear me, Mr. Chairman? Yes, we can.

Okay, thank you very much. I am here with the applicant and owner, Sharon Burke. We are seeking a change request from C32, Commercial Manufacturing and Employment to C22, Motor Vehicle Related Commercial District to permit a residential use on the second floor and to continue the commercial use on the ground floor and convert the second floor to one dwelling unit.

We have worked very closely with the community. We have worked with Alderman Roberto Maldonado, who on June 25th, 2020, submitted his letter of approval for the zoning change. We are unaware of any objectors to this, and we would welcome any questions.

Dean, we have a letter of support from Alderman Maldonado, as you say.

[Speaker 1] (2:30:47 - 2:30:52)
Do we have questions from committee members for the applicant?

[Speaker 5] (2:30:53 - 2:30:55)
Alderman Lopez moves do pass if there's no questions.

[Speaker 1] (2:30:56 - 2:31:42)
All right. So I didn't see any hands up or questions. So Alderman Ray Lopez moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. All right. Stay on the line, Dean. I think you're next also.

On document number 20445, 26th floor. Ordinance was referred on July 22nd of 2020. This address, common address, 2636 West Evergreen Avenue.

Change request. An RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RT4 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district. Dean, proceed.

[Speaker 28] (2:31:43 - 2:32:38)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee again. Dean T. Maragos of the law firm of Maragos & Maragos at 1 North LaSalle Street.

I'm here with the owner and applicant, Ileana Mansour. We are requesting an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to RT4 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district to build a three-story residential masonry building with three residential dwelling units and three onsite enclosed parking spaces. Once again, we have worked very closely with the community and Alderman Maldonado, and he has issued to us to the committee, his letter of support for the zoning change for 2636 West Evergreen from RS3 to RT4.

We would entertain any questions of the chair or members of the board.

[Speaker 40] (2:32:38 - 2:32:39)
Thank you, Dean.

[Speaker 1] (2:32:39 - 2:32:43)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Maldonado. Questions?

[Speaker 5] (2:32:46 - 2:32:47)
Move to pass, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:32:50 - 2:32:54)
Alderman Dowell moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

[Speaker 28] (2:32:55 - 2:33:04)
Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. Have a great day. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:33:04 - 2:33:28)
Now we're top of page seven, document number 20452, 25th Ward. Ordinance was referred on July 22nd of 2020. The change request, C12 neighborhood commercial district to a C13 neighborhood commercial district, and the address is 1860, is it Blue Island?

[Speaker 7] (2:33:28 - 2:33:30)
1860 to 1862 South.

[Speaker 1] (2:33:30 - 2:33:41)
Oh, I'm sorry, 1860 or 1862 South Blue Island Avenue. Sorry for that confusion. My confusion, I should say.

[Speaker 24] (2:33:42 - 2:34:49)
Tyler Manick is the attorney for the applicant. Tyler. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Tyler Manick of the Shane Banks Law Firm. I'm here on behalf of the owner, 1860 Blue LLC, which owns a subject property at 1860 to 62 South Blue Island. The property is a three-story commercial building and has ground floor retail with two stories of office above.

The property is currently zoned C12 and is a legal nonconforming development that exceeds the bulk requirements of that district. The owner seeks to rezone the property to the conforming zoning district of C13 in order to perform deferred maintenance of the property through appropriate billing permits. Prior to filing the zoning map amendment application, the applicant met with the alderman, the alderman's zoning advisory council and neighbors who all support this application.

We have submitted an aldermanic letter of support with this application. With the support of the alderman, I respectfully request this committee's favorable recommendation to rezone 1860 to 62 South Blue Island to C13 zoning district. And I'd be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (2:34:50 - 2:35:00)
Thank you, Tyler. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Siccio-Lopez. I see the alderman on the line.

Is there anything more you wanna comment on, Alderman Siccio-Lopez?

[Speaker 10] (2:35:02 - 2:36:54)
No, thank you, chairman. Just very briefly, I really appreciate the follow-up on this project in this particular area. We wanna make sure that we continue having a transparent process.

Unfortunately, in the past, we had in this particular area with this project is that a lot of irregularities, even some permits given before the application is even submitted. Under the previous administration, this is a sensitive area. We wanna make sure that we have, of course, applications that are supported and vetted by the residents.

We look forward to having these kinds of applications that are in line with what we wanna see. What we wanna see as a community is an area as a commercial corridor, but we, of course, we wanna continue to see a good balance between the existing businesses. There's a proposal of expansion of the Lozano Library.

We also very close to the Benito Juarez High School. So it's good to see commercial applications that are in line with the fabric of the neighborhood. Was just concerned before there was irregularities even around lifting more terms on tavern licenses and other unfortunate irregularities, but I'm glad to see that we continue to having a process that allow us to have commercial spaces that we continue to have growth in the neighborhood, but always in line with the social fabric what was around and more important than anything else, that we respect the residents that are much more impacted than anybody else.

So thank you again, and I look forward to continue seeing an area where we balance development, but also respecting our neighbors.

[Speaker 1] (2:36:55 - 2:36:58)
Thank you, Alderman. Do we have questions for the Alderman or the applicant?

[Speaker 5] (2:36:59 - 2:37:01)
The other Lopez moves do pass.

[Speaker 1] (2:37:02 - 2:37:10)
Alderman Ray Lopez makes motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that motion?

[Speaker 3] (2:37:11 - 2:37:11)
So moved.

[Speaker 1] (2:37:12 - 2:37:50)
Hearing none, the item is passed. Thank you. Now we're in the middle of page seven, document number 20451, Seventh Ward.

Ordinance was referred on July 22nd of 2020. Common address, 3006 through 3012 East 78th Street. And the change request, plan development number 935 to RM5, residential multi-unit district.

And we have Tyler Manick on this one again.

[Speaker 24] (2:37:50 - 2:38:44)
Tyler. Afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Tyler Manick of the Shane Banks Law Firm.

I wouldn't ask you to refer to me. I'm here on behalf of Elam Industries, which owns the property at 3012 East 78th Street, the subject property. The subject property is zoned as a residential plan development.

The plan development was approved by city council in 2004 and expired in 2010 under its PD statements because no construction of the property was commenced in the time period within the plan development. As a result, the property must be rezoned out of the plan development so the applicant may develop the parcel. The applicant has met with Alderman Mitchell about this matter.

Alderman is fully supportive of the applicant's request to rezone this lot to an RM5.5 zoning district. The applicant has submitted a substitute ordinance and would ask this committee to move to adopt the substitute ordinance.

[Speaker 10] (2:38:45 - 2:38:47)
Okay. Would you ask?

[Speaker 24] (2:38:47 - 2:38:48)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (2:38:49 - 2:38:53)
From the department, either Steve or Patrick, do we have a substitute?

[Speaker 27] (2:39:00 - 2:39:10)
Hello? Sorry, I was on mute. No, but we have a substitute on this.

Tyler, did you get that to Anna?

[Speaker 24] (2:39:11 - 2:39:21)
Yeah, we sent it to Anna and Nicole back in July. Okay, we'll double check, but I mean, we'll double check and I'll circle back, Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (2:39:23 - 2:39:31)
All right. So Patrick, you're gonna have to, we're gonna hold this and you're gonna check on that for us so we can proceed one way or another, right?

[Speaker 26] (2:39:34 - 2:39:42)
Yes. Nope, Anna just walked in. Yes, we do have it, but that it went up to RM5.5, RM5.5. Okay, yeah.

[Speaker 1] (2:39:42 - 2:39:55)
Okay, because that's what in the narrative was an RM5, but according to Tyler and now you, it's an RM5.5. We did republish it. And it has been republished with the change.

[Speaker 14] (2:39:55 - 2:39:58)
With the .5. I don't know if Tyler re-noted.

[Speaker 24] (2:39:58 - 2:40:03)
Yeah, we re-noticed. We sent it to Anna to re-notice and the committee.

[Speaker 1] (2:40:04 - 2:40:42)
So we're in compliance with all the regulatory aspect of this change? Yes, sir. Okay.

So Alderman Ravois moves to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the substitute is before us.

And so we've got it up to an RM5.5. And for the benefit of the committee members, the reason we're doing this is because the timeframe of what, six years, seven years has elapsed?

[Speaker 24] (2:40:43 - 2:40:44)
Six years, your honor.

[Speaker 1] (2:40:45 - 2:41:16)
Okay. Questions, comments? All right, I have one further question on it though.

So what was the previous plan development that expired? Was it some kind of expansion of this industry? It was townhomes.

Okay. All right. Had nothing to do with the owner of the property, which obviously is a, looks like it should be used.

[Speaker 24] (2:41:17 - 2:41:28)
No, she just bought the property this summer. Also, she had no affiliation with the prior project. Okay, all righty.

[Speaker 1] (2:41:29 - 2:41:33)
That was my question. Any other questions?

[Speaker 5] (2:41:33 - 2:41:36)
Move to approve chairman. Okay. Alderman Lopez moves to approve.

[Speaker 1] (2:41:36 - 2:42:34)
Alderman Lopez moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that motion? Hearing none, the item is passed as substituted.

Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. Okay, bottom of page seven, document number 20463, 24th ward.

Ordinance was referred on July 22nd of 2020. Common address, 2100 South Pulaski Road. Change request, B32 community shopping district to a B23 neighborhood mixed use district.

Our attorney is Richard Zolke. Richard. Richard, can you unmute so we can hear you?

[Speaker 40] (2:42:43 - 2:42:43)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:42:44 - 2:42:58)
So what we'll do, we're gonna hold on. Wait, do we hear him, Richard? Yeah, this is David Zolke.

Okay. All right, well, are you representing the applicant on 2100 South Pulaski?

[Speaker 11] (2:42:58 - 2:43:19)
Yes, I'm sorry about that. Yes. Let's identify yourself for the record so we can proceed.

Well, we were gonna ask to defer this matter to the next. All right. To the next meeting.

We tried to contact the office, but. Well, okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:43:19 - 2:43:46)
So that's no major problem. So it's a late deferral. So Alderman Roboius moves to defer this item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Hearing any objections, questions? Hearing none, this item is deferred. Are we deferring it to the next meeting or what are we doing?

[Speaker 11] (2:43:47 - 2:43:49)
Yes, please, to the next meeting, we'd be fine.

[Speaker 1] (2:43:50 - 2:43:54)
Okay, so it'll be deferred till the next meeting. Thank you.

[Speaker 11] (2:43:55 - 2:43:59)
All right. Thank you. Have a good day.

[Speaker 1] (2:43:59 - 2:44:30)
Okay, thank you. All right, now we're on the top of page eight. Item number 20461, T1, 11th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on July 22nd of 2020. Common address 335 through 337 West 30th Place. Change request, M12 Limited Manufacturing Business Park District to a B22 Neighborhood Mixed Use District.

We have Paul Kolpak on the application.

[Speaker 38] (2:44:30 - 2:44:53)
Paul. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the board. My name is Paul Kolpak.

I represent the applicant, Mr. Scalise. This is a type one. We did file a substitute narrative and I was asked that the substitute narrative and the plans be introduced into this proceeding.

[Speaker 5] (2:44:54 - 2:44:55)
So move, Chairman Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 1] (2:44:56 - 2:45:09)
Alderman Ray Lopez moves to accept the substitute narrative plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that motion? Hearing none, the substitute narrative plans are accepted.

[Speaker 38] (2:45:09 - 2:45:57)
Continue, Paul. The applicant intends to request a zoning change from his existing M1-2 to that of a B2-2 to subdivide lots 22 and 23. Both lots are owned by the applicant.

He intends on keeping the single family residence, which recently has been deconverted, which will remain on lot 23. And his intention is to sell lot 22 to his son and his son will then construct a new two-story dwelling unit with basement single family residents on that lot. We did have a community meeting.

We have community support and I believe there's a letter of support from Alderman Thompson in your file. And we're prepared to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (2:45:57 - 2:46:09)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Patrick Thompson. Paul, questions from committee members. Quick question for you, Paul.

[Speaker 38] (2:46:09 - 2:46:23)
Why are we doing B? Well, we thought that for the side yards that it would work out better. That was the reason for it.

Okay, the Alderman's cool with that? Yes, he is. Okay, other questions?

[Speaker 1] (2:46:25 - 2:46:31)
Hearing none, can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

[Speaker 3] (2:46:31 - 2:46:31)
So moved.

[Speaker 1] (2:46:33 - 2:46:39)
Alderman Ravoyos moves to pass. Any objections? Hearing none, the item's passed.

[Speaker 14] (2:46:39 - 2:46:40)
With substitute narrative.

[Speaker 1] (2:46:40 - 2:47:16)
With the substantive narrative. Narrative. All right.

Thank you very much. Everybody be well. Okay, now we're in the middle of page eight.

Document number 20446 in the sixth ward. Ordinance was referred on July 22nd of 2020. Common address 7151 through 7153 South Halsted Street.

The change request to B12 neighborhood shopping district to a C12 neighborhood commercial district. We have Sabrina Harrell, I believe, on this application. Sabrina?

[Speaker 12] (2:47:17 - 2:49:18)
Yes, good afternoon. My name is Sabrina Harrell. I'm here on behalf of the applicant, Grind 39.

The applicant is seeking to rezone from B1-2 to C1-2 for the purpose of having a restaurant that will also be able to sell alcoholic beverages. The property is located at 7151 to 5353 South Halsted Street. It takes up two lots.

And there's two lots to the north that is vacant land. And those lots are gonna be used for off-street parking. It's approximately 14 to 16 parking spaces should be able to fit within those lots.

We met with Alderman Sawyer along with the applicant. And at the request of Alderman Sawyer, we also had a community meeting in which Alderman Sawyer was present to answer any questions that any community member had, and also to be able to inform them of his support. In the area, there's no restaurants, no sit-down restaurants, there's only fast food.

So people in the community either have to go south to the Beverly neighborhood or north to Hyde Park neighborhood in order to have a sit-down meal. I should mention that the owners of Grind 39 is a family-owned business. And they actually have a restaurant or renovating a restaurant a few blocks down on 76th and Halsted.

They're renovating that right now as we speak. And that's going to be a breakfast restaurant. So this is a community in desperate need of revitalization.

And therefore, I'm asking for the support of the committee and that our request is granted and that we are rezoned from B1-2 to C1-2.

[Speaker 1] (2:49:19 - 2:49:30)
Okay. All right, we do have some questions from committee members. Before we get to that, Sabrina, for the record, your last name is Herrera?

[Speaker 12] (2:49:30 - 2:49:31)
Herrera.

[Speaker 1] (2:49:32 - 2:50:07)
Okay. Okay, that's number one. Number two is the subject matter are two lots.

We have nothing to do with the parking and whatever might ensue on that particular parcels, even though you've worked it out. This subject hearing is only on the 71-51 through 53 South Halsted. Okay.

Okay. This is going to be, as you say, a sit-down restaurant with full food and beverage. Is that correct?

[Speaker 40] (2:50:08 - 2:50:09)
Correct.

[Speaker 1] (2:50:11 - 2:50:39)
All right. Okay, well, I would have my own other questions, but you've already met with the alderman and you're going to a C, which is more of a tavern and more liberal use. That's my question.

But I'm going to leave it up to the alderman and his decision for the community, which do you have, I'm sorry, do you have a copy of the letter of support?

[Speaker 12] (2:50:40 - 2:50:40)
Yes, we do.

[Speaker 1] (2:50:41 - 2:50:42)
Well, we need to get it.

[Speaker 12] (2:50:43 - 2:50:44)
We did send it.

[Speaker 1] (2:50:45 - 2:50:47)
You did send it to Nicole in my office?

[Speaker 12] (2:50:48 - 2:50:48)
Yes, we did.

[Speaker 1] (2:50:49 - 2:50:50)
We'll make sure.

[Speaker 21] (2:50:50 - 2:50:51)
I'll contact her after the meeting.

[Speaker 1] (2:50:51 - 2:51:07)
Okay, because we're going to double back with you on that. All right. Nicole is just so FYI.

All right, Alderman Lopez, a neighboring alderman over there. So Ray, you want to talk about this one or ask questions?

[Speaker 5] (2:51:09 - 2:51:43)
Actually, I just want to commend our colleague, Alderman Sawyer. I think the nearest sit-down restaurant is only at Kennedy King, to be honest, on Halsted, almost a mile and a half away. So it's a welcome addition to the neighborhood.

The question I did actually have was with regards to COVID. I'm assuming the lots also in the meantime are going to be used more for outdoor dining than parking at this point. Has there been any discussion on that?

[Speaker 12] (2:51:46 - 2:52:19)
From the drawings I saw, I don't see where the architect has included outdoor dining, but I'm sure that's something. Their design was before COVID hit, so I'm sure that's something that will have to be reconsidered. But I should note that it's going to take some time to get the project done.

First, clearly, they have to secure a building permit. They also have to go through the license process, and then they have to renovate the building. So we are clearly looking at anywhere from 15 months to two years.

[Speaker 5] (2:52:21 - 2:52:44)
Okay, well, thank you for that answer. I'm excited to see another addition, a sit-down addition to our neighborhoods on the south side. And hopefully by then COVID will just be an asterisk in history, God willing, by the time you open up.

Congratulations to you and to our colleague. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 23] (2:52:45 - 2:52:51)
All right, Alderman Osterman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Alderman Osterman, can you hear me okay?

Loud and clear.

[Speaker 37] (2:52:52 - 2:52:52)
Great.

[Speaker 23] (2:52:53 - 2:53:15)
I just wanted to ask the question you were going to ask, and I think I want to congratulate my colleague, Alderman Sawyer, on bringing the business, and even though it'll take time, I think it'll help revitalize the community. But just in, I think, in layman's terms to the attorney, you could explain why you want to go to the C zoning versus a B zoning that might let you do the same thing.

[Speaker 12] (2:53:15 - 2:53:32)
No, because the, when the architect processed the zoning for the permit application, it was rejected. And they were informed that it had, we had to go to C1-2 in order for them to be able to actually sell alcohol. So that's the reason.

[Speaker 23] (2:53:33 - 2:53:36)
Okay. Thank you for that. And all the best with the project.

[Speaker 12] (2:53:37 - 2:53:37)
Thank you.

[Speaker 23] (2:53:37 - 2:53:37)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:53:41 - 2:54:04)
Just, Alderman Osterman, sometimes I think, depending on the restaurant is designed, there's just a lot more bar than food service area there. That might've been 100% sure. That might've been the rejection because of the overall percentage of square footage devoted to liquor only.

[Speaker 31] (2:54:06 - 2:54:06)
Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:54:08 - 2:54:08)
Alderman Dow.

[Speaker 31] (2:54:09 - 2:54:13)
I just want to be clear. Is this a restaurant or is this a tavern?

[Speaker 1] (2:54:16 - 2:54:24)
We can ask the, I asked that question in the beginning, but let's ask our attorney to answer the question.

[Speaker 12] (2:54:25 - 2:54:58)
Okay, well, it is a restaurant and bar. It's going to be called Grind 39 Sports Bar and Grill. But, and it's about 50-50 seating for restaurant and 50 bar.

But as far as the, for the zoning application, we were required to use the term, establish tavern use with the service of food. That is what Anna approved for the language.

[Speaker 1] (2:55:00 - 2:55:06)
Excuse me, Chairman. Well, wait, wait, wait. Wait a second.

I'm going to wait. Oh, is that Alderman Sawyer on the line?

[Speaker 26] (2:55:06 - 2:55:07)
Yes, it is.

[Speaker 25] (2:55:07 - 2:55:07)
Yes, it is.

[Speaker 1] (2:55:08 - 2:55:18)
Okay. Okay, well then Alderman, we're on the South Halsted. Yes.

If you were listening in, there was a question about why it needed a C zoning.

[Speaker 15] (2:55:20 - 2:55:22)
Well, I mean, it was my understanding.

[Speaker 28] (2:55:23 - 2:55:26)
This is a tavern with a incidental use.

[Speaker 15] (2:55:28 - 2:55:45)
I did see the plans and I am, I have received the plans architecturally. That will be a question. I know that would be a matter, but it was an expansive use.

It's a very large place.

[Speaker 31] (2:55:46 - 2:55:49)
You're breaking up, Alderman. Can you hear me better?

[Speaker 1] (2:55:50 - 2:55:53)
You're coming in and out. Oh, I'm sorry.

[Speaker 15] (2:55:53 - 2:56:17)
Chair, can you all hear me better now? Yes, sir. What I was just saying, it's a fairly large place with extensive dining capacity.

So I didn't know how much percentage wise would be dedicated toward the dining as opposed to the tavern operation. That was something I would defer to zoning about.

[Speaker 11] (2:56:21 - 2:56:23)
You just muted yourself. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:56:23 - 2:56:25)
All right, hold on a second.

[Speaker 26] (2:56:26 - 2:56:34)
Is there, how about Steve, Valencia or Patrick? Can you- Chairman, can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (2:56:35 - 2:56:38)
Steve, I can hear you now. Let's say- That's a good question.

[Speaker 26] (2:56:38 - 2:57:12)
Yes, so this is Steve Valenciano, Department of Planning and Development. And because of the design of the facility or of the rest of the bar, it qualifies or is classified as a tavern because of the amount of seating in the taverns area compared to the overall seating in the establishment. So they will require a tavern license and it requires a C1 to be done as of right.

The other question I did have is that the parking lot, is the parking lot included in this zoning change?

[Speaker 1] (2:57:13 - 2:57:20)
No, it's, well, I don't see it, but let's ask the Sabrina about that.

[Speaker 12] (2:57:21 - 2:57:22)
No, it is not.

[Speaker 26] (2:57:23 - 2:57:29)
But is it, I guess that's my question. Is it contiguous to the tavern itself?

[Speaker 12] (2:57:30 - 2:57:31)
Yes, it is.

[Speaker 26] (2:57:31 - 2:57:49)
Okay, so I think what you're gonna need to do right now is defer this and re-notice and rezone a larger piece of property to include the parking because the, otherwise you're gonna have a split zoning situation.

[Speaker 1] (2:57:51 - 2:57:53)
Well, let me just, all right.

[Speaker 26] (2:57:53 - 2:58:12)
Well, I'm saying you won't be, when you come to get your permit, you're gonna have an issue because of the split zoning of the lot. If the parking lot is zone D1 and then the building is zone C1, the ordinance says if there's a conflict, you go with a more restrictive regulation.

[Speaker 1] (2:58:13 - 2:58:35)
All right, so let me just ask the question in order to try to expedite this. That's later on down the road. I mean, it would require, I don't even know the size of this restaurant, but depending on its location.

[Speaker 12] (2:58:36 - 2:58:39)
It's 6,250 square feet.

[Speaker 26] (2:58:40 - 2:58:52)
All right, so what- I'm sorry, Chairman. I just got a message from Anna Robles and she says that the entire lot is involved in the zoning change. So it does include the parking lot.

So we're fine.

[Speaker 1] (2:58:53 - 2:59:19)
Okay, good. Just for practical purposes on a 6,000 square foot restaurant, what is the legal requirement for parking? I don't think it's- Even though it might not be the best way to pursue it.

There would be about five spaces for what they're doing. Legally, they would need five.

[Speaker 12] (2:59:21 - 2:59:25)
But I am, the architect has proposed it's 14.

[Speaker 1] (2:59:26 - 2:59:37)
Oh yeah, well, that's all good. But at least from our perspective that we're approving this today for what I'm hearing from Anna is four city lots.

[Speaker 26] (2:59:39 - 2:59:57)
Right, and I just wanted to make sure because if we're going to use it as outside dining, that would be where you would come up with the issue. And I just wanna make sure that since we are seeing more and more of this outside dining, that it is included. So it is, according to Anna, the whole lot is in.

So that's good, that's fine.

[Speaker 1] (2:59:58 - 3:00:04)
Sabrina and Alderman Sawyer, are you guys cool with that? I'm fine, I'm good.

[Speaker 40] (3:00:04 - 3:00:05)
Okay.

[Speaker 12] (3:00:06 - 3:00:16)
Yes, and it is actually stated in paragraph 13 that the property will provide 14 on-site parking spaces that are adjacent to the existing one-story building.

[Speaker 1] (3:00:16 - 3:00:40)
Yeah, Sabrina, I think it's just a matter are there four individual pins that we're gonna be changing the zoning at? And that's what we've heard from the department is that that's all gonna be done today. And then you can figure out the license, you can figure out everything else.

But we wanna get you started and not have you come back a second time is I think what we don't want to happen for you.

[Speaker 12] (3:00:42 - 3:00:43)
Great.

[Speaker 1] (3:00:43 - 3:00:49)
It's okay with that? Very nice. Okay, how about our department?

You cool with that, Steve?

[Speaker 26] (3:00:50 - 3:00:52)
Yeah, we're square now, yes.

[Speaker 1] (3:00:52 - 3:00:58)
Great, okay. Questions for the Alderman? Hearing no other questions, can I get a motion?

[Speaker 5] (3:00:59 - 3:01:00)
So moved, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (3:01:01 - 3:01:14)
Alderman Roboyas moves, do pass on the motion by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

[Speaker 12] (3:01:15 - 3:01:16)
Thanks, committee, have a great day.

[Speaker 1] (3:01:16 - 3:02:40)
Good luck, okay. Now, we're gonna go out of order to page three, back to page three, and top of page three. This is document number 8506, 28th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on November 26th of 19. The common addresses are 2401 through 2547 West Congress Street, 2410 through 2546 West Harrison Street, 2400 through 2538 West Flourney Street, 2400 through 2534 West Lexington Street, and various other additional addressees. The change request, RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district, an RM4.5 residential multi-unit district, an RM5 residential multi-unit district, and a B22 neighborhood mixed-use district. All those are gonna be converted to an RT3.5 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district if we pass on these ordinances. And this is an Aldermanic. We have Jason Irvin that would like to explain to the committee.

Alderman Irvin.

[Speaker 27] (3:02:41 - 3:04:18)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. Again, this is part two of a down zoning request that we've been working with the Tri-Taylor Community Association on. The first portion we did a couple of months ago was the area east of Western.

We're now focusing on the area west of Western, which is roughly bounded by Western on the east. The railroad tracks that separate near west from the East Garfield Park on the west, Congress on the north, and Roosevelt Road on the south. This area I had with a slight exclusion of a M district in that area that already is existing along Campbell.

Primarily, this is a request to down zone fairly dense area to something that is a little more appropriate for the neighborhood and for the community. Again, this process has been initiated with our office along with the Tri-Taylor Community Association and there's overwhelming support for this particular change. Again, the request of the community is that the buildings in the area not be so tall as they distort the character of the existing properties in the neighborhood.

So if it would please the committee, if there are any questions, I'd be happy to answer them. Otherwise I would ask for a favorable vote for members of the committee.

[Speaker 1] (3:04:20 - 3:04:57)
Thank you, Alderman Irvin. Questions for the Alderman? Hearing no questions, can I get a motion?

Move do pass on the item. So moved. So moved.

Cardona. Alderman Cardona moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that motion?

Hearing none, the item is passed. And I wanted to thank the Alderman for his patience in working with our committee on this ordinance. I know it's been a while, so appreciate your patience.

Thanks, Jason.

[Speaker 28] (3:04:58 - 3:04:59)
All right, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, guys.

[Speaker 1] (3:05:00 - 3:05:36)
Okay. All right, now back to the bottom of page eight. This is document number 20458, second ward.

Ordinance was referred on July 22nd of 2020. The common address is 1534 West Augusta Boulevard. And the change request, RS3, residential single unit detached house district to an RM4.5 residential multi-unit district. And we have the attorney, Nick Fatikas on this one. How about it, Nick?

[Speaker 33] (3:05:40 - 3:06:31)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. I'm stepping in for Nick today. For the record, my name is Daniel Box, and I'm an attorney with the Law Offices of Sam Banks.

I'm here today on behalf of the applicant, 1534 West Augusta LLC. The applicant is the contract purchaser of the subject property located at 1534 West Augusta Boulevard. The applicant is seeking to construct a new three-story, three-unit residential building at the property.

To do so, the applicant intends to raise the existing two-story single family home at the site. In order to permit the project, the applicant is seeking a zoning change from an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RM4.5 residential multi-unit district. We have worked with Alderman Hopkins on this project.

I believe a letter of support is already on file with your office. And with that, I'd be happy to answer any questions that you might have.

[Speaker 1] (3:06:31 - 3:07:01)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Hopkins. Questions from committee members? I don't see any hands up.

Can I get a motion? Mr. Chairman, I'll move to pass. Alderman Austin moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, it's passed.

[Speaker 33] (3:07:03 - 3:07:04)
Thank you all.

[Speaker 1] (3:07:09 - 3:07:52)
Okay, all right. All right, now we're on the top of page nine, document number 20462-T1 in the first ward. The ordinance was referred on July 22nd of 2020.

The common address 1914 through 1924 West Chicago Avenue. The change request, V32 community shopping district and an RT residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district all to a C23 motor vehicle related commercial district. Our attorney is John Fritchie.

Good afternoon, John. Are you on the line?

[Speaker 29] (3:07:52 - 3:08:46)
Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, how is everybody? We're good. As you said, this is to combine a split zoning into a new zoning classification.

And it's intended to do a couple of things. Members of the committee may be familiar with the property. It's an existing Roots Pizza.

And next door to that is an existing Westtown Bakery. And the same owners also have a restaurant on the rooftop called Homestead. This rezoning is being sought to do a few things.

One to consolidate the zoning, but also to allow the potential enclosure of the outdoor rooftop restaurant, which now more than ever is going to be a business necessity. But also to allow for the potential expansion of the building on the east side of the property for additional commercial purposes. There have been extensive meetings going on with the community group.

Alderman LaSpada and his office have been fantastic all along the way. We have no objection to this. We'd be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (3:08:47 - 3:08:52)
Thank you, John. We do have a question. We'll start with Alderman Osterman.

[Speaker 23] (3:08:54 - 3:09:04)
Yeah, I got a couple of questions for the attorney. This is gonna increase automobile traffic. Are we trying to get away from that and get rid of cars?

[Speaker 29] (3:09:05 - 3:09:34)
More foot traffic for local businesses? This actually is three local businesses built into one and has worked very well actually with no existing parking, nor would there be any needed here. They have already curb cuts and loading docks on both sides of the property.

And what about- I appreciate the inquiry though. There are actually bicycle racks right in front. Okay, no further questions.

We're trying to make it walkable like Andersonville.

[Speaker 23] (3:09:35 - 3:09:37)
All right, John.

[Speaker 1] (3:09:38 - 3:09:45)
Any other questions? Do we have a letter of support from Alderman LaSpada?

[Speaker 14] (3:09:45 - 3:09:50)
We do. He wanted to speak on the matter, but I don't see him on here, but he does support the matter.

[Speaker 29] (3:09:51 - 3:10:00)
John, do you have a letter of support? There's a September 3rd letter of support from the Alderman that was submitted to members of the committee as well as myself.

[Speaker 5] (3:10:01 - 3:10:01)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (3:10:02 - 3:10:13)
And then, I'm just playing a devil's advocate here. C2, are you training any change of uses with the C2?

[Speaker 29] (3:10:14 - 3:10:29)
Well, the C2 is for potential change of use, especially with respect to the eastern parcel. They wanna have some greater leeway with respect to potential commercial tenants, as well as a potential opportunity to put in a dispensary social equity license holder once those have been determined.

[Speaker 1] (3:10:29 - 3:10:40)
I think that's where I was going, John. And that has been brought to the community, and the Alderman is well aware of.

[Speaker 29] (3:10:41 - 3:10:55)
That's been explicitly and lengthily discussed with the community and the Alderman. And in fact, it is noted in the Alderman's letter of support that this is also with respect to a potential social equity dispensary location.

[Speaker 1] (3:10:57 - 3:11:07)
That's the extent of my question. All right. Any other questions?

If not, can I get a motion? So moved.

[Speaker 3] (3:11:08 - 3:11:09)
So moved. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (3:11:09 - 3:11:25)
So Alderman Osterman moves to pass on the motion by the same roll call vote that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to the motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Thank you, John.

[Speaker 40] (3:11:25 - 3:11:25)
Thank you all.

[Speaker 1] (3:11:25 - 3:11:58)
Thank you, John. Take care. All right.

Now we're in the middle of page nine, document number 20448. The 27th warrant ordinance was referred on July 22nd of 2020. This common address is 2019 West Washington Boulevard.

Change request, RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to an RM4.5 residential multi-unit district. We have Bruce Ross as the attorney.

[Speaker 39] (3:11:59 - 3:12:07)
Yes. So I'm basically, this is a four-unit dwelling. We have a letter of support from the Alderman as well as- Wait, wait, wait, Bruce.

[Speaker 1] (3:12:07 - 3:12:11)
Just identify yourself again for the record before you start your testimony.

[Speaker 39] (3:12:11 - 3:12:55)
Absolutely. My name is Bruce Ross. I'm actually the developer on the project.

Worked closely with Alderman Burnett to get this going as well. Can you explain it now to the committee So basically this is a vacant lot. What we're looking to do is build a four-unit dwelling on this particular space.

There's a couple of things. It's currently zoned as RT4, as you noted. We're looking to move it to an RT4.5 to get to the height level we need for a four-unit with the garden apartment. So effectively it also has three parking spaces. So we're looking for the parking variance as well with respect to the neighborhood.

[Speaker 1] (3:12:56 - 3:13:02)
All right. So I think Alderman Burnett's on the call. Alderman Burnett?

[Speaker 3] (3:13:03 - 3:13:22)
Yeah. And please excuse me, Mr. Chairman and Bruce. You know, it's probably been a while since we met.

So did we meet with the Westtown Neighborhood Chamber, the Westtown Neighbors, Neighbors of Westtown?

[Speaker 39] (3:13:22 - 3:13:31)
No, no. It was near West. So on Damon, oh, excuse me, on Western.

But Eddie Winters, with respect to the Howe community.

[Speaker 3] (3:13:31 - 3:13:57)
Yeah, well, Howe, homeowners of Westtown. I'm sorry. Right, right, right.

Okay. And we went to the church. I had the meeting and everything was okay.

All right. Yeah, I'm in support of it. He did meet with the community.

We had a community meeting. It's been a while. As you can see, Mr. Chairman, I got so many of these things and this COVID set us back. But yeah, the community's in support of it. I'm in support of it. We have community support.

[Speaker 1] (3:13:58 - 3:14:06)
Thank you, Alderman. I'm looking at the application. Correct me if I'm wrong.

This is the owner of the property is City of Chicago Department of Housing?

[Speaker 39] (3:14:10 - 3:14:11)
That is correct.

[Speaker 1] (3:14:12 - 3:14:17)
And Mr. Ross, you are buying it from the City of Chicago?

[Speaker 39] (3:14:17 - 3:14:18)
That is correct.

[Speaker 1] (3:14:19 - 3:14:20)
And you're putting four units on there?

[Speaker 39] (3:14:21 - 3:14:21)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (3:14:23 - 3:14:28)
And is there an affordability on this property?

[Speaker 39] (3:14:29 - 3:14:33)
No, that was not included in the negotiated sale.

[Speaker 1] (3:14:34 - 3:14:48)
Okay. All right. I don't have any other questions.

Anybody on the committee? All right. I hear a motion to support this.

[Speaker 40] (3:14:51 - 3:14:52)
So moved.

[Speaker 1] (3:14:52 - 3:15:43)
Second. Is that chairman? Yes.

Alderman Austin moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to the motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Thank you. All right. Bottom of page nine, document number 20296 in the 27th ward.

The ordinance was referred on December 18th of 19. Common address is 1140 West Erie Street. Change request.

M12 limited manufacturing business park district to a B35 community shopping district and then to a residential business plan development. We have Katie Janky Dell. Dale, I'm sorry.

Katie.

[Speaker 7] (3:15:44 - 3:16:04)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Katie Janky Dell from the law firm of DLA Piper. And with my colleague, Rich Clowder, we represent 1140 West Erie LLC, the applicant for this matter.

As a preliminary item, we'd like to incorporate the record from the August 20th, 2020 planning commission meeting where this matter was heard.

[Speaker 1] (3:16:06 - 3:16:18)
Alderman Cardona moves to incorporate the records for the planning commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the records are incorporated.

Continue, Katie.

[Speaker 7] (3:16:18 - 3:17:44)
Thank you. The property is an irregularly shaped parcel bounded by Ogden, May and Erie. The applicant is requesting this zoning change in order to build an eight story residential building with 113 units.

This project is subject to the near north pilot and as a result is a 20% requirement that per the pilot, none would have to be provided on site. However, as a result of discussions with the community as well as Alderman Burnett, we've agreed to provide 5% on site at 60% of AMI, 15% offsite, which has the benefit of allowing us to provide more three bedroom family size affordable units when zero would be required. So 26% of our affordable units will be three bedrooms and zero would be required otherwise.

This ARO strategy also allows us to potentially provide two extra units above and beyond the 20% requirement in a couple of the unit or buildings that have garden units and also allows for rehabilitation of failing buildings in gentrifying neighborhoods such as Garfield Park and Humboldt Park. Like I said, we've met with Alderman Burnett and worked very closely with the neighbors of River West on this project, which has been a long time coming. We've been working on this one since for almost two years now and we're happy to answer any questions, but appreciate your time and consideration of this.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:17:45 - 3:17:51)
Thank you, Katie. I know we have Alderman Burnett on this item. Walter.

[Speaker 3] (3:17:52 - 3:18:54)
Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. So as the council has said, they've been working for two years on this. Matter of fact, the community organization, the neighbors of River West, I got so many community organizations, the neighbors of River West encouraged them to change this design a couple of times.

Also the planning department encouraged them to make some changes. They've worked with them. We've negotiated, as you can see on the affordable housing, we were able to get bigger units and also a couple of extra affordable units out of the deal.

This is a developer who's built something down the street. That's why it was easy for him to work with the community because he kept his commitments with the community with the past development. With that we ask, so the neighbors of River West approved it.

We had a community meeting. We approved it. We asked for the community support also.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:18:55 - 3:19:03)
Thank you, Alderman. Questions for the Alderman or the applicants? Hearing none, can I get a motion?

[Speaker 3] (3:19:05 - 3:19:06)
Move, so moved.

[Speaker 1] (3:19:07 - 3:19:19)
Alderman Roboyes moves do pass as a call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that motion? Hearing none, the item is passed as revised.

[Speaker 7] (3:19:20 - 3:19:20)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:19:21 - 3:19:59)
Thank you. Now we're going to top of page 10, item number 19900, 25th Ward. Ordinance was referred on November 14th of 2018.

Common address 1115 West Washington Boulevard and 19 through 27 North May Street. The change request residential plan development number 1357 to residential plan development number 1357 as amended. So Katie Jankydale, you're on this one again.

[Speaker 7] (3:20:00 - 3:20:18)
Great, thank you again for the record. My name is Katie Jankydale from the law firm of DLA Piper. I represent the applicant, 19 North May LLC.

The preliminary item, this matter is also heard by the planning commission on July 16th, 2020. We would request that the committee incorporate the record from that planning commission hearing.

[Speaker 1] (3:20:21 - 3:20:33)
Alderman Cardona moves to incorporate the records from the planning commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objection on the motion? Hearing none, the records are incorporated.

Continue.

[Speaker 7] (3:20:34 - 3:21:50)
Thank you. The property is located on the East side of May Street between Washington and Madison. We are seeking this PD amendment in order to modify the plans for what will be sub area B to allow for a 15 story residential building containing 58 units and 78 parking spaces.

The overall project will result in a neighborhood opportunity bonus fund payment of approximately $2.7 million. Of the 58 proposed units, 28 were previously approved pursuant to the 2015 ARO, predates the pilot and generates a three unit requirement. The 30 new units generate a six unit ARO requirement.

However, in working with the community and the alderman, the applicant has agreed to forego the ability to pay the fee in lieu for the previously approved units and instead build nine for sale, affordable single family homes pursuant to the pilot. We've worked very closely with the community, including the three different community groups and the 25th Board Zoning Advisory Board. And I'm not sure if he's on, but you should have a letter of support in your file from Alderman Sicho Lopez.

With that, we're available for any questions, but appreciate your time and consideration of this. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:21:51 - 3:22:01)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Sicho Lopez. I see he's still on the call. Alderman Sicho Lopez, would you like to comment on this?

[Speaker 10] (3:22:04 - 3:23:32)
Thank you, Chairman. Now, again, we follow up, we follow our community-driven zoning process, have multiple meetings with the stakeholders in the community, in particular our Zoning Advisory Board, recommended the approval. I know that this has been waiting for quite some time.

So we appreciate the applicant's patience to make sure that we have a good process. We will continue working with the applicant in terms of the local hiring component. I know that that was important for a lot of the people who attended the meetings and Zoning Advisory Board members.

And of course, making sure that these, I know that there's some concerns, of course, on the congestion that already the West Loop has. And I know that there's a commitment to make sure that we work with the construction company on site to make sure that we don't repeat some issues that happened in the past in the first phase. So again, we'll continue working on the application following up.

The local hiring component, of course, is something that has been brought up in several occasions. And I also like to urge our colleagues so that we, there's a work in progress and we appreciate the applicant's patience. I know we've done the best we can.

There's a lot of room for improvement, but I look forward to working together to a proposal that is beneficial to the neighborhood and the city as a whole.

[Speaker 1] (3:23:33 - 3:23:59)
Thank you, Alderman. Questions for the Alderman? I have a quick question for you, Alderman Sitio Lopez.

So just to summarize for the benefit of the committee, we have, what, 73 residential units in this handsome building. And there are how many affordable units in this building? In the building itself?

[Speaker 7] (3:24:00 - 3:24:14)
I can inspect, it's 58 units in this new building. It is a condo, luxury condo building. So we won't be providing units onsite, but we will be providing single family homes offsite.

[Speaker 1] (3:24:15 - 3:24:18)
Within the community area, I presume, Katie?

[Speaker 7] (3:24:18 - 3:24:28)
Right, the first 10% or the first three have to be within two miles. The second six have to be anywhere within the pilot or the arrow in the pilot.

[Speaker 40] (3:24:28 - 3:24:29)
Okay.

[Speaker 10] (3:24:30 - 3:25:34)
And Chairman, just to add very quickly, I know that you asked, but I want to make sure the applicant also has a time to respond. In terms of the offsite affordable housing units, these are affordable townhomes that will be available to the community. And we have worked to make it as within or the legal framework as affordable as possible.

So now the range is between 100 and 120% AMI. We have agreed with the applicant to make it at 100%, so the lower end, to make it as affordable as we can in areas of need. So we'll have identified in our areas on the West side, and I know some units will be also allocated for the Pilsen area.

So we're trying to, of course, have within the area, making sure that we serve in different communities, even outside of the 25th Ward. I understand we do have a huge issue of affordability. So we've been working with the housing department, trying to make it as affordable and as a spread out as possible so that we meet different demographics.

[Speaker 1] (3:25:35 - 3:25:42)
Thank you, Alderman. I see Alderman Villegas' hand is raised. Alderman Villegas.

[Speaker 33] (3:25:43 - 3:25:44)
Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 27] (3:25:44 - 3:25:48)
What are the costs of these luxury condos?

[Speaker 7] (3:25:48 - 3:26:13)
Well, one thing to clarify while I get that per square foot basis is to clarify we're actually doing affordable single family homes instead of townhomes for the offsite aero units, which I know it's very well received at Planning Commission. And let me just get the per square foot onsite.

[Speaker 1] (3:26:23 - 3:26:37)
While we're waiting for Katie, I wanted to tell the committee members that the Public Safety Committee is going to start at 2.30 rather than two o'clock.

[Speaker 7] (3:26:38 - 3:26:51)
And God willing, we'll be done by 2.15. So the pricing we're expecting is around $600 per square foot for the condo units onsite.

[Speaker 9] (3:26:52 - 3:26:53)
And what's the average?

[Speaker 7] (3:26:54 - 3:27:01)
Sorry, that results in about a million dollar purchase price or sale price for the units.

[Speaker 27] (3:27:02 - 3:27:09)
So about a million dollars per and the single family homes, what are the prices of the single family homes?

[Speaker 7] (3:27:10 - 3:27:46)
We've been working with the Department of Housing. We haven't identified the sites quite yet. Obviously because it's a condo project, we have a pretty significant and unfortunately probably a more significant period of pre-sales that we have to hit before we can even pull a permit and start construction.

But using the formulas from DOH will arrive at those offsite affordable. And it may be based on different numbers than what we have today, given it's based on the AMIs of the year that we start marketing those single family homes.

[Speaker 25] (3:27:48 - 3:27:50)
Can you give an approximation?

[Speaker 7] (3:27:50 - 3:28:06)
I believe that on some ones that we've been doing for the first phase, we are at about 319,000 for those homes.

[Speaker 27] (3:28:06 - 3:28:08)
319,000?

[Speaker 7] (3:28:08 - 3:28:08)
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 27] (3:28:08 - 3:28:10)
And how many bedrooms, et cetera?

[Speaker 7] (3:28:11 - 3:28:17)
They are, I believe they're all going to be four bedroom offsite single family homes.

[Speaker 27] (3:28:18 - 3:28:19)
Cool, all right.

[Speaker 28] (3:28:19 - 3:28:20)
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (3:28:21 - 3:28:36)
All right, other questions from committee members? Hearing none, can I get a motion? Move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

So moved by Osterman.

[Speaker 25] (3:28:36 - 3:28:37)
Move to pass Alderman Cardona.

[Speaker 1] (3:28:39 - 3:29:30)
Alderman Osterman moves to pass. Any objections to that motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Congratulations on that one. All right, you've heard that public safety is going to be started at 2.30, right? Okay.

Now we're on the bottom of page 10, document number 20397, 20th Ward. Ordinance was referred on April 22nd of 2020. Common address, 38 West 64th Street.

Change request, M23 Light Industry District and M12 Limited Manufacturing Business District to an M32 Heavy Industry District and then to a plan development. John Lawler is on the line representing this application.

[Speaker 13] (3:29:31 - 3:29:36)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. Can you hear me okay?

[Speaker 1] (3:29:37 - 3:29:50)
Yeah, now we can hear you. There's a little bit of static, but I think we can hear you loud and clear now, John. You're muted now, I think, so.

[Speaker 13] (3:29:52 - 3:30:27)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Okay, good. Thank you.

My name is Jack Lawler, attorney and partner with the Dentons Law Firm in Chicago, representing the applicant, the People's Gaslight and Coke Company. This application was approved by the Chicago Plan Commission at its August 20 meeting with the support of 20th Ward Alderman Jeanette Taylor. Mr. Chairman, we respectfully request that the August 20 record of the plan commission be incorporated into the record of this proceeding. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (3:30:27 - 3:30:39)
Alderman Siccio-Lopez moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to the motion? Hearing none, the records are incorporated.

[Speaker 13] (3:30:40 - 3:33:24)
Well, thank you. The People's Gaslight and Coke Company proposes to construct a two-story, approximately 86,000 square foot district field service center at 38 West 64th Street, replacing a similar century-old facility that's currently located on the site. Just so you know, a field service center houses people's personnel and assets that are engaged in operating the utility company and maintaining its infrastructure systems.

So uses include offices, vehicle storage and repair, fueling stations, and communications facilities. The subject property is located in an area that's dominated by transportation-related uses, such as the nearby Dan Ryan Expressway and the nearby rail yards. Land uses in the vicinity are also consistent with transportation type uses and orientated uses, such as Chicago's Fleet Management Facility on 65th Street, A&A Auto Repair, and Transmissions for West.

The project before you today is substantially similar to similar shop projects located at 4001 Peterson and 4201 West 35th Street, previously approved by the Plan Commission and City Council as PDs number 1413 and 1425 in 2019 and 2018. The Department of Planning's report to the Plan Commission states that the proposed development of the subject property will be generously landscaped and provide buffering and scenery, hiding the project from public view. The PD application before you first proposes to rezone the 11.27 acre site from its existing M23 and M12 zoning district to the same M3-2 classification that the city approved underlying zoning district for people similar north and south shop facilities that I described a moment ago. As required under the Chicago Zoning Ordinance, because this project is over 10 acres, we are also seeking plan development approval. The approximately $65 million south shop investment is anticipated to generate 250 construction jobs. And I have with me today, Project Architect Eric Buck, if you would like to have him walk you through the site, as well as Alan Weber, People's Facilities Construction Manager, who's available to answer questions.

[Speaker 1] (3:33:26 - 3:33:49)
John, we'll see if the Alderman have questions on it. Obviously, I think most of us are familiar with that heavily dense area there and the uses, but let's see what the Alderman have. And you've met with the Alderman?

Yeah. Because I know we had that letter of support at Planning Commission, I believe.

[Speaker 13] (3:33:49 - 3:33:50)
Correct.

[Speaker 1] (3:33:52 - 3:33:54)
And again, you've always had this site.

[Speaker 13] (3:33:56 - 3:33:57)
For over a century.

[Speaker 1] (3:33:58 - 3:34:01)
Yeah, yeah. So it's not like it's a new use to the neighbors.

[Speaker 13] (3:34:02 - 3:34:04)
No, and there are no residences nearby.

[Speaker 1] (3:34:05 - 3:34:34)
Well, that's another issue we'll talk about in the near future with this heavy industry in regards to zoning and its proximity to residential, but that's another day. So we do have a letter of support from Alderman Jeanette Taylor. Questions from committee members?

Just, I'm sorry, did I hear it in your presentation? Is there's LEED certification here?

[Speaker 13] (3:34:34 - 3:34:42)
I don't believe the building is LEED certified, but the architect is here if you have questions.

[Speaker 1] (3:34:43 - 3:34:59)
Well, that's a question I have, since it is interesting. It's a necessary use, but we've seen a lot of projects with ComEd and others that have some degree of LEED certification. So I don't know.

[Speaker 13] (3:34:59 - 3:35:05)
Well, there's a lot of very admirable features. Perhaps we could let the project architect, Eric Buck say a few words at this point.

[Speaker 11] (3:35:06 - 3:35:14)
Eric, are you with us? Please do. I'm here.

Can you hear me? Yes, we can, Eric. Yeah, we're not going to.

[Speaker 1] (3:35:17 - 3:35:18)
I can't hear you. Let me see.

[Speaker 11] (3:35:19 - 3:36:44)
Try it again. Can you hear me now? Yes, sir.

All right. This is, we're using the sustainable. Identify yourself for the record, please.

My name is Eric Buck. I'm a senior project architect with Epstein Architecture and Engineering. I've been working on all the PD projects with People's Gas here before.

Let me find my page. We're meeting the distinct Chicago Sustainable Compliance Path 100 point goal instead of LEED. If we were pursuing LEED, that would take up 80% of the project points.

But instead we're pursuing the 100 point path and kind of highlights are exceeding the baseline model required by Chicago Energy Conservation Code, exceeding the storage and rate components of stormwater ordinance, a green roof of over more than 50% of the roof, electric vehicle charging stations for company vehicles and employees. And this strategy has also been employed successfully at North and Central Shops. This is a picture of the ground floor plan with a picture of electric vehicle charging stations at Central Shop.

[Speaker 1] (3:36:46 - 3:36:50)
I think Alderman Dowell has her hand up. Alderman Dowell.

[Speaker 31] (3:36:51 - 3:37:04)
Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is also for the architect.

I see you're putting a crosswalk on 64th and State. Can you talk about your landscaping plans?

[Speaker 11] (3:37:05 - 3:38:02)
Along State Street. If we can go back to the landscape plan at the, I think it's like slide 11. There.

So that's the architectural site plan. Let's go down to the landscaping. Next slide down.

Yes. So landscaping plan is, there's landscaping in the employee parking, which is to the upper right-hand corner of the site. And there's screening around 64th, along State and West 65th Street.

We've been working with zoning and the DPD to exceed the required number of screening trees and in the approved landscape plan, which is this. And also developed along with precedent set by the North and Central Shops.

[Speaker 31] (3:38:04 - 3:38:06)
Okay, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (3:38:06 - 3:38:16)
Thank you, Alderman. Any other questions? Hearing none.

Can I get a motion to move to pass by the same to determine quorum?

[Speaker 31] (3:38:17 - 3:38:17)
Move to pass.

[Speaker 1] (3:38:18 - 3:39:42)
Alderman Dowell makes that motion. Any objections to the motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

And thank you. Maybe we should have heard for the entire presentation, but you certainly, I think have accommodated us in the energy certification and also the landscape plans. All right, now we're going to the top of page 11.

This is application number 20421, 14th Ward, Oregon, so it's referred on June 17th of 2020. The common address is 3330 through 3356 West 51st Street. The change request M12, limited manufacturing business park district to an M222 light industry district.

This is going to be a deferred item based on the attorney or based on the attorney Mark Kupiak. Alderman Roboius moves to defer this item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Hearing no objections, this item is deferred.

All right, now we are on, Nicole, thank you, staff. We're on our last item?

[Speaker 21] (3:39:42 - 3:39:43)
Our last item.

[Speaker 1] (3:39:43 - 3:40:17)
All right, middle of page 11, document number 20419, 27th Ward, Oregon, so it's referred on June 17th of 2020. Common address is 1012 through 1024 West Randolph Street and 147 to 155 North Carpenter Street. Change request, C13 neighborhood commercial district to DX5 downtown mixed use district and our attorney is Kate Duncan.

Kate.

[Speaker 36] (3:40:17 - 3:41:51)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee on Zoning. My name is Kate Duncan. I'm an attorney with Ackerman LLP with offices at 71 South Wecker Drive.

I'm appearing this afternoon on behalf of the applicant L3-1020 West Randolph LLC in connection with application number 20419. Present this afternoon on behalf of the applicant is Whitney Robinette and also present is the architect for the project, Jillian Agdern from Hartford Plunkard Architecture. The subject property is located at 1012 to 1024 West Randolph Street and is currently located in the C13 neighborhood commercial district.

The applicant filed this application for zoning amendment in order to reclassify the property to DX5 downtown mixed use district. The subject property currently contains an existing building that was formerly used as a bank with multiple drive-through lanes. Applicant is proposing to demolish the existing bank building and to construct a five-story masonry building that conforms with the character of the neighborhood.

Applicant proposes to use the building for retail on the ground floor with boutique office space on the upper floors. The property is located in Alderman Walter Burnett's ward and the applicant has met with the West Central Association, the neighbors of the West Loop and the West Loop Community Organization and has received the support of these three organizations. We also have met with the Alderman extensively and believe to speak on behalf of this matter today.

On behalf of my client, I respectfully request your favorable recommendation, thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:41:52 - 3:41:55)
Thank you, Kate. Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 3] (3:41:55 - 3:42:38)
Thank you, Chairman and members of the committee. As the councilor said, they have met with the local community organizations, which there are three, and they've garnered their support. We also had a Zoom community meeting and didn't have any objections.

This is near the landmark district over in the Fulton Market and it's very fitting that they would build a building of this size in that area. We appreciate them making the investment in our community. The community supports that I supported and ask for a committee support.

[Speaker 40] (3:42:42 - 3:42:42)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (3:42:44 - 3:43:03)
Questions for the Alderman? I just have a comment, Walter. It's a handsome building and this building in of itself is not in the landmark district, but you've asked them to kind of conform with some of the similar architecture we see in the district.

Is that correct?

[Speaker 3] (3:43:03 - 3:43:22)
No, I didn't ask them. They, this is a, you know, unique because this is a young organization and they saw fitting to do that. And I appreciate that and the community appreciates it.

Yeah. So I can't take the credit for it.

[Speaker 1] (3:43:23 - 3:43:39)
All right. Thank you, Alderman. Questions for Alderman Burnett or the applicant?

Hearing no questions, can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call as the one that determined quorum?

[Speaker 9] (3:43:40 - 3:43:41)
So moved by Alderman Austin.

[Speaker 1] (3:43:42 - 3:43:52)
Alderman Austin moves to pass. Any objections to that motion? Hearing none, the item is passed as revised.

[Speaker 40] (3:43:53 - 3:43:54)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (3:43:54 - 3:44:23)
All right. All right. I think we have no more items on the agenda.

I wanna thank my committee members for their patience. Can I get a motion to adjourn? Alderman Riley so moves.

Alderman Riley, Alderman Riley, you're quiet today. We have no applications in your ward, Alderman? Not this week.

We'll double up the next time, I think. All right. Thank you, Alderman.

Alderman Riley moves to adjourn. All those in favor?

[Speaker 40] (3:44:24 - 3:44:25)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (3:44:26 - 3:44:34)
Any opposed? The meeting is adjourned. We'll see you tomorrow, everybody.

Thank you.
