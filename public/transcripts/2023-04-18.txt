We have three and no audio, just we have three total. Okay, where's my list here? I will start with audio first.

The first speaker, Peter McNally. Peter. Good morning.

Good morning, sir.

[Speaker 27] (23:01 - 23:02)
Identify yourself.

[Speaker 1] (23:03 - 23:04)
Peter McNally. Good morning, Peter.

[Speaker 18] (23:05 - 26:20)
Yes, this is Peter McNally. Proceed. Good morning, everyone.

I'm Peter McNally, and I own the building at 3735 North Sheffield, directly next door to the applicant who is seeking to spot upstone his property at 3731 to 33 North Sheffield. We would first like to thank you all for your services as Aldermen toward the great city of Chicago, as it's understood that you all have a tough job and effort to please all the people all the time. As a mid-block and directly adjacent property owner, we object to the proposed spot upstoning of 3731, 33 North Sheffield due to the following facts and reasons.

Number one, solar obstruction. Such extended development under the proposed RM-5 spot zoning of the southerly adjacent property to ours will effectively cut us off from the sun for most of the year and thus severely impact our plans to develop a six kilowatt solar PV system. We have shared the conceptual design and solar project with our Aldermen's office, who so far appears not to be willing to give us any help in this matter.

Number two, the proposal offends the historic district. The proposed spot upstoning supports the shoving of a commercial scale development into the middle of a well-established RT-4 residential two flat zone. Thus, the upstoning is incompatible with the historical aesthetics and context of the neighborhood.

The domino effect of the proposed upstoning will set a dangerous precedent that will destroy the character of the mid-block neighborhood. The applicant's building and our directly adjacent building is identified as orange on the Chicago Historic Resource Survey. Number three, the application is misleading.

The application as presented is deceptive on at least two fronts. One, while the application cites that the addition of only one dwelling unit, it fails to address the removal of seven smaller and affordable dwelling units that exist to the applicant's building. While stating that the proposal involves the addition of only one dwelling unit, it fails to reference the 256% increased floor area and occupant load.

The proposal would effectively result with the removal of seven affordable housing units and it would be reconfigured such that all the existing tenants in the building at 3731 North Sheffield would have to be displaced for the developer's ambition. Number two, it's misleading because the project rendering fails to honestly address the whole context of the neighborhood and instead shows that the abutting buildings are nondescript modern cubic structures that would make the proposed black monolith less intrusive. Further, the project rendering implies that the effective abutting buildings each have panoramic lake views, which is not the truth.

Number four, there was inadequate notice of this matter. The sponsor's attorney snail-mailed a cryptic one page notice dated March 15th and we did not receive until early April due to slow mail and travel schedule.

[Speaker 1] (26:20 - 26:39)
We were not- Thank you, Mr. McNally. I know when that item comes up, it's in the 44th ward, so I'll be happy to opine on it when we get there. Next speaker, Staff Funk, F-U-N-K.

[Speaker 36] (26:39 - 26:44)
Good morning. Can folks hear me?

[Speaker 1] (26:45 - 26:48)
We can hear you. Could you identify yourself, please?

[Speaker 35] (26:49 - 28:24)
Sure. My name is Staff Funk. Okay, proceed.

Thank you very much. Thank you, Chairman Tunney and fellow members of the Zoning Landmarks and Building Standards Committee for the opportunity to speak today. Like I mentioned, my name is Staff Funk.

I'm the Civic Engagement Manager with the Chicago Food Policy Action Council. The council partners with communities to advocate for and implement policies that advance food sovereignty across the Chicagoland region. Today, I'm speaking in support of the amendment of Municipal Code Chapters 4-8 and 17-9 regarding licensing of urban farms and community gardens.

By moving this amendment forward, the city will expand opportunities for the production of local, sustainable, and fairly produced foods within the city of Chicago. Currently, commercial urban agriculture producers are shoehorned into other license types, which are expensive and don't properly cover their commercial activity. This has been an ongoing issue since 2011, when the commercial agriculture zone was added to the zoning code with a parallel license to reflect the zoning change.

We are excited to see this ordinance move forward after 12 years of discussion and advocacy efforts. Creating a parallel license for commercial growers will legally and safely welcome them into Chicago's local economy, bolstering job opportunities, community welfare, and public health and safety. Urban agriculture provides opportunities for community members and entrepreneurs, particularly on the South and West sides of Chicago, to transform vacant and empty lots into vibrant spaces for growing food and community gatherings.

We are elated for this ordinance to move forward in the time for the upcoming growing season. Thank you all for your time and support on this important ordinance.

[Speaker 1] (28:25 - 28:31)
Thank you. Our next speaker is Pam Piane, P-I-A-N-E.

[Speaker 36] (28:37 - 29:57)
Good morning. My name is Pam Piane, and I live at 3738 North Sheffield. I've owned and lived in that property for 45 years.

I am speaking in opposition to the project at 3731-33 North Sheffield. The reasons being that the building will dwarf all the other buildings around it by sheer size, design, and color. Actually, it resembles the new building at the Southeast corner of Sheffield and Grace, which has done nothing to enhance the street at all.

I believe the zoning code requires that new structures preserve the character of the neighborhood, and this certainly does not do that. It appears there's no attempt in the design to harmonize with other buildings in the immediate area. In fact, it is dissonant.

It will significantly cut down on the sunlight on our side, the West side of the street. Population density is already at a saturation point in the immediate area, and a building with this many units and tenants will push density over the top. As everyone knows, parking the city is a problem, and this building will only make it worse.

I hope you consider all of the oppositions that you have heard. Thank you very much for your time.

[Speaker 1] (29:58 - 30:13)
Thank you, Pam. Our next, I think those are the only ones dialed in, is that correct? So we'll go to the people that are here.

We'll start with Jack Spicer.

[Speaker 37] (30:20 - 30:24)
Good morning, Jack Spicer, representing the Promontory Point Conservancy.

[Speaker 1] (30:24 - 30:30)
Can we all hear, all good? Okay, continue, please.

[Speaker 37] (30:30 - 31:30)
This is a great honor that you're considering landmarking Promontory Point today. It's a great honor for the community, which we've worked so hard for so long. It's a great honor to the Landmarks Commission, the staff that worked on a very complicated ordinance, and the commissioners who voted unanimously to landmark Promontory Point.

It's also a great honor to our elected officials, all of whom support landmarking, Robin Kelly, Robert Peters, Curtis Tarver, Bill Lowry, and most important of all, your colleague, Leslie Hairston, who for 23 of her 24 years in office has supported saving Promontory Point. This is a great honor for her today. We've also, I think there's been a lot of learning in the last 23 years.

The community has learned that, yes, indeed, we can count on elected officials to do the right thing. And elected officials have learned that they can count on our community. We don't give up.

Thank you very, very much for your time this morning.

[Speaker 1] (31:31 - 32:10)
Thank you, Jack. Our next speaker is Mario Short. Or it could be Maria, I'm sorry.

From American Property Holdings. Mario, I think. And we don't hear from him.

We just know he is in opposition to 936 North Elston. Let's have our final speaker of this morning, George Blakemore. Mr. Blakemore.

[Speaker 19] (32:15 - 32:15)
Good morning.

[Speaker 1] (32:16 - 32:17)
Good morning, sir.

[Speaker 19] (32:17 - 35:16)
Opposition of the whole process. You have over 100 items on your agenda. Why would you, and people will be here all day.

You could even divide this up into another day. And another opposition that I have against this whole process is that you pay the play with your lawyers. If those people that want to have something rezoned, they get one of these lawyers that's hooked up with the city, pay the play.

And another thing, when the community is involved, you should have a meeting and it should be video how the people voted for or against. And they don't need the power of the alderman. They should take this power away from the local alderman of the area.

Because that's where the corruption come in, is pay the play. So this whole process is flawed. Excuse me.

When the people got to be involved, let the people vote in their community if they want this to be rezoned. And whatever the people say, that's supposed to be the final word. They should take it away from these local so-called aldermen.

That's where the corruption come in, when you pay the play. And I've been coming down here for years, and you see the same political hooked up attorney. If you pay those attorneys, then you can get it rezoned.

If you don't pay those attorneys, it's flawed. Where the individuals should be able to come in on their own without these attorneys and use this process for or against the zoning. It's waste, fraud, and abuse right here.

And I'm waiting. You used to steal my time, but I think I've got you now because people are monitoring how long I've been up here. And that little thing, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, you sit down at me because you've been doing this and you're a part of the problem too, Tony.

And I'm glad Lady Life got rid of you. So it's all down here, waste, fraud, and abuse. You gotta be politically connected to get something rezoned.

And this must stop. And the reason it goes on because the people are part of this too. They pay to play.

[Speaker 40] (35:19 - 35:21)
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

[Speaker 37] (35:26 - 35:27)
It's been a pleasure, George.

[Speaker 1] (35:29 - 36:41)
All right, we've been joined by Alderman Riley. Anybody, anybody else? All right.

That concludes the public speaking portion of the hearing. We'll start off today with the addendum to the agenda with the previously deferred urban agricultural ordinance, document number 02022-3989. The amendment municipal codes 4-8 and 17-9 regarding the licensing of urban farms and community gardens.

The item has a substitute, which was accepted by the committee at the March 14th, 2023 Committee on Zoning. All members of the committee should have received a copy of the substitute as well as a summary electronically. You will also find one in your folder today.

Correct, Nicole? Isn't Nicole great? She is something.

She is really something. All right. So we have Ruby Ferguson, the food equity policy lead in the mayor's office to present on this matter, as well as representatives from various departments to answer any questions.

Why don't we come up over here, please? Whoever the team, as I said, we've got about five to seven minutes.

[Speaker 27] (36:49 - 37:01)
All right. And then we'll do some Q&A. Fine.

[Speaker 32] (37:08 - 38:43)
Good morning. And thank you for having me to come again and provide a briefer presentation around the urban agriculture business license that we're proposing. My name is Ruby Ferguson and I staff Chicago's Food Equity Council.

And so first I wanted to ground in what the ordinance does do. And that allows us to make changes to a current license, which is the produce merchant license to allow growers, including community gardens and urban farms to sell directly to community via a produce stand. And the produce needs to be whole, uncut, unprocessed produce.

This ordinance doesn't make any changes to the zoning language as it stands. And allows community gardens and urban farms to sell processed produce or does not allow them to sell processed produce or prepared foods. So again, really focusing on selling whole uncut processed produce.

So the way that we're approaching this is through three small changes. And those small changes allow the license to be held citywide, allow farmers to keep up a stand overnight instead of taking them down at the end of each day and then making sales directly to consumers of that whole uncut, unprocessed produce. Up here, you'll see the requirements of produce stands.

So the size limitations are that they cannot exceed 150 square feet or be higher than 15 feet in height above the ground. And then they're also required to follow setback requirements. That's the quick version.

So I can stop and hold and see if we have any questions.

[Speaker 1] (38:45 - 38:51)
Questions from committee members. Now, have you reached out to Alderman Raymond Lopez?

[Speaker 32] (38:52 - 38:52)
Yes, we did.

[Speaker 1] (38:52 - 39:55)
We met with him last week. He was concerned about this. And I believe for the record, I did speak to him myself.

He has a much more comprehensive idea about farms, farm animals and residential neighborhoods. But passing this by no means deters him from moving forward on something more comprehensive, I should say. So I know I did talk to him.

He's not happy about it because of things that he and other of us have introduced that have gone nowhere. So Raymond's not here. I can't really speak for him, but I spoke to him about this issue and he is not with us today.

But I think he's, yeah, quote, on its face, I have no problem with this. It just, he would like a more comprehensive approach to farming, farm animals in the city of Chicago. All right, any questions from committee members?

Alderman David Moore.

[Speaker 27] (39:59 - 40:02)
They go through BCAP to get a license for this, right?

[Speaker 1] (40:02 - 40:03)
Could you speak into the mic, David?

[Speaker 14] (40:04 - 40:19)
They go through BACP to get a specific license for this, correct? And so it's not limited to just produce, because I'm hearing you say, talking about the farm animal piece.

[Speaker 32] (40:21 - 40:32)
That's not included. This is exclusive to produce. So that's exclusive to produce.

Exactly, and unprocessed produce. So any prepared foods or processed produce, you'd require to get a separate license.

[Speaker 40] (40:32 - 40:33)
All right, thank you.

[Speaker 1] (40:34 - 41:36)
Any other questions? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine form? Yep, that motion was made by Alderman Kappelman.

Any objections to the motion? Hearing none, this item is passed and we refer to the city council tomorrow. Thank you for that presentation within the timeframe.

I appreciate it, because we have a long agenda today. All right, next. Next on the addendum, we have two fee waivers for historical landmark properties in the fourth ward.

I'll read them into the record and we will hear them together. That being document number OR2023-67 for the property located at 3321 South Prairie Avenue and document number OR2023-66 for the property located at 3300 through 3304 South Giles. We have Michelle Rimes from the Department of Planning and Development here to speak on the item.

[Speaker 12] (41:37 - 45:39)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. I'm Michelle Rimes. I'm from the Department of Planning and Development representing the Commission on Chicago Landmarks.

We are seeking the approval of two permit fee waivers, one in the amount of $8,000 for site number one located at 3304 South Giles Avenue and $4,000 for site number two located at 3321 South Prairie Avenue. The developer for both sites is Grace K. Contractors, LLC, who is also the property owner.

Slide number two, please. The aerial photograph at site number one is on the left. It is of the proposed new construction of lots highlighted in red.

The site plan with construction of lots 11 and 12 are outlined in red on the right. Slide number three, please. The owner proposes to expend $1,850,000 for construction of two new single family frame residential buildings with brick, stone and cement hardy board facades and two, two and a half car detached garages.

Site number one, slide number four, please. The following is the proposed scope of work. Excavation of the lot, poured cement footings and walls for both structures as well as for sidewalks and patio areas.

Five, slide five, please. Construction of a two by six lumber exterior frame are attached to the foundation and enveloped with the veneer brick and rear decks with steel stairs and the installation of plumbing, electrical and HVAC systems and double hung windows with a landscape facade and yard. The installation of exterior lights as well as iron and wood fencing and other construction improvements as needed.

Next slide. The owner proposes to expend $850,000 for construction of a new single family residential building with brick, stone and cement hardy board facade and also with a two and a half car garage. This is site number two.

The aerial photograph, next slide, please. I think we've, we're out of sequence. That's all right, I'll continue.

The aerial photograph on the left is a proposed new construction for the site highlighted in red. The owner proposes to expend $850,000 for site number two at 3321 South Prairie for the new strength, pardon me, for a new frame and brick stone single family residential building which also will have a two and a half car garage. The scope of work is similar to that of the development site on 3300 and 3304 South Giles Avenue.

Both sites were vetted by the Commission on Chicago Landmarks during its November 3rd, 2022 meeting. Fourth Ward Alderman Sophia D. King supports the proposed projects and provided testimony during the commission meeting on behalf of the developments.

The Department of Planning and Development Historic Preservation Division respectfully asked for this committee to approve the proposed permit fee waivers for the construction of three new single family residential buildings and detached garages located at 3300 and 3304 South Giles Avenue and at 3321 South Prairie Avenue.

[Speaker 1] (45:42 - 45:54)
Thank you, Michelle. That would be a point of information from Alderman Burnett. Could you speak in, okay, great.

This is a landmark.

[Speaker 22] (45:54 - 45:57)
This is not, this is for profit or not for profit?

[Speaker 12] (45:59 - 46:06)
These are for profit properties. They're infill development in the existing landmark district.

[Speaker 22] (46:08 - 46:22)
And so, and I don't recall, have we ever had a fee waiver for landmarks come before? Yeah, for for profits?

[Speaker 1] (46:23 - 47:20)
Yeah. Okay, all right, thank you, Mr. Chairman. All right, as Michelle said, we do have the support of Alderman Sophia King, Alderwoman, I should say.

Any other questions or comments? Okay, motion moved to pass by the same roll call that was used in the quorum. That would be by Alderman Cardona.

Any objections to that? Hearing none, these orders will be passed and reported out. All right, next we have two historical landmark designations.

First is in the 27th Ward, document number 02023-1159 for the designation of the Greater Union Baptist Church located at 1956 West Warren Boulevard, I believe. We have Matt Crawford here from the Department of Planning and Development to present on the matter. Where's Matt?

[Speaker 20] (47:20 - 49:34)
Thank you, thank you, Chairman. Good morning, everybody. For the record, my name is Matt Crawford.

I'm a planner with the Department of Planning and Development and staff to the Commission on Chicago Landmarks. The Commission on Chicago Landmarks has recommended to council that Greater Union Baptist Church be designated as a Chicago landmark. The church stands at 1956 West Warren Boulevard in the near West Side community area in Alderman's, Walter Burnett's Ward 27.

The Landmarks Commission found that the building bears aspects of the city's heritage. It was built in 1886 as the Church of the Redeemer, a universalist congregation, which in addition to worship, attended to the social and cultural needs of the community through charitable work, musical programs, and lectures. In 1928, the church was rechristened as the Greater Union Baptist Church when it was purchased by a black Baptist congregation that was founded in 1908.

And that has maintained the building as a spiritual, social, and cultural home on the near West Side for nearly a century. The building is also important for its association with important leaders like Reverend Shelby Hamilton Graham, who embraced non-religious political organization during the Civil Rights Movement, as well as the current pastor, Reverend Dr. Walter A. McRae, a recognized scholar on the black and African presence in scripture.

Finally, architecturally, the building is a massively scaled and well-proportioned brick church with distinct terracotta details. It also includes an excellent collection of stained glass by the Chicago firm of Macaulay and Miles. And the commission's recommendation to use the building is also important as the work of William LeBaron Jenney.

He was a leading architect in Chicago and is credited with developing the steel frame skyscraper. So that's the end of my presentation. I'm happy to answer any questions you have.

Thank you, Matt.

[Speaker 1] (49:36 - 49:40)
Questions, comments, Alderman Scott Wagesbeck.

[Speaker 24] (49:44 - 49:52)
What were the other two churches that were similar and have they already gone through the process?

[Speaker 20] (49:53 - 50:10)
By William LeBaron Jenney? They're not in Chicago. One is in Michigan and one's in Riverside, Illinois.

And this is arguably the best example in terms of- And the structure is, I'm sorry, go ahead. This is the leading church designed by Jenney.

[Speaker 24] (50:12 - 50:16)
Great. And the structure is pretty sound, solid.

[Speaker 20] (50:17 - 50:34)
It's extremely well-built building. Jenney being a master of engineering and design, Jenney actually served in the Civil War as an engineer. It's a very well-built building.

It does need attention and maintenance, but it's very stable.

[Speaker 28] (50:36 - 50:42)
Excellent. Thank you. Thank you, Chairman.

It's beautiful. Okay. I'll move to pass if there's no other questions.

[Speaker 1] (50:43 - 50:47)
I think Walter, is that in your ward? Would you like to speak on it or not?

[Speaker 22] (50:52 - 50:54)
I'm in full support of it, Mr. Chair.

[Speaker 39] (50:54 - 50:54)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (50:55 - 51:17)
All right. Questions, comments? Alderman Wogsback makes the motion move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, this item is passed and will be reported out tomorrow. Congratulations.

Oh, yes, we do have Alderman Hopkins. Matt, before you go, these buildings that are up there, are any of them standing?

[Speaker 20] (51:20 - 51:41)
Three on the right-hand side of the slide are all standing in the loop, and they're all designated Chicago landmarks. The one on the left was the first steel-framed skyscraper by Jenny. It no longer stands.

It was replaced by the field building in the 1930s. Thank you. All right.

Let me see.

[Speaker 1] (51:41 - 52:12)
Now we've got a special item, I believe, in the fifth ward. Where is our alderwoman? All right.

Let me read it into the record. In the fifth ward, document number 02023-1211, the designation of Promontory Point, east of South Jean Baptiste Point-Gusavo Lakeshore Drive, between 54th Street and 56th Street. We have Candlin Hahn from the Department of Planning and Development here to present on the matter.

Good morning.

[Speaker 11] (52:13 - 52:54)
Good morning. So, my name, as you said, Candlin Hahn, and I work in the Historic Preservation Division in the Department of Planning and Development. On February 15th, the Chicago Park District Board of Commissioners voted to consent to landmark designation of Promontory Point by the city of Chicago.

Having received almost 500 letters and emails of support for the designation, including one from Illinois State Senator Robert Peters of the 13th District, on March 9th, the Commission on Chicago Landmarks made a final vote to recommend landmark designation of Promontory Point to city council. Fifth Ward Alderman Leslie A. Hairston requested and supports the landmark designation.

[Speaker 1] (52:54 - 52:59)
Really? Just, you know. Casually.

Casually.

[Speaker 11] (53:01 - 56:22)
Promontory Point's located at the southern end of Chicago's 600-acre Lakeside Burnham Park. It's a peninsula made entirely of artificial landfill. Its curving landform, edged by some of the last remaining stepped limestone revetment along the lakeshore, provides views and physical access to Lake Michigan and has been a favorite spot for Chicagoans since it was completed in 1939.

Renowned architect and planner Daniel H. Burnham proposed the construction of linear parkland from fill along the southern half of the city's lakeshore as part of his 1909 plan of Chicago. Promontory Point would be located toward the bottom left in this image, and development of this new green space began in the 19-teens.

Here's Promontory Point circa 1930. The promontory's been established, but the area behind the bulkhead has yet to be infilled. In 1934, voters approved the Park Consolidation Act, bringing together 22 independent park districts to establish the Chicago Park District, and with the means to access federal money through the Works Progress Administration, President Roosevelt's New Deal program to provide work to millions of job seekers through the completion of public works programs.

In the mid-30s, these funds allowed the Chicago Park District to complete the Promontory Point while providing jobs for hundreds of Chicagoans during the Depression. These photos show the recently infilled site being graded and stepped limestone revetments being built at the edge of the promontory. By 1937, construction of the Pavilion Building, which would function as a public shelter with bathrooms, is underway at the east end, and you can see the newly completed underpass at 55th Street at the west end.

This still provides pedestrian access to the site today. The Chicago Park District tapped new hire and talented landscape architect Alfred Caldwell to produce a landscape plan for Promontory Point. His design made dramatic use of the site's views by framing them through openings at the north and south sides of a broad central meadow edged with trees and other naturalistic plantings.

The enclosure created by the plantings contrasted with the open perimeter of the site with the limestone revetments. Those revetments are the city's last largely intact stretch of original terraced stone revetments, variations of which once defined most of Chicago's shoreline during the 20th century. Chicago Park District head architect, Emmanuel Buchsbaum, designed the point's French eclectic style pavilion with a central tower at the crux of two gabled wings.

And the David Wallach fountain, designed by established Chicago sculptors, Frank and Elizabeth Hibbard, marks the entrance to the point. The commission recognized the significance of the designers, architects, and the artists who contributed to Promontory Point, seen here, Alfred Caldwell, Emmanuel Buchsbaum, Frank and Elizabeth Hazeltine Hibbard. Finally, the commission recognizes Promontory Point as a distinctive visual feature of Chicago's southern lakeshore.

Unmatched by any other location in Hyde Park, with the park district's pavilion building for waterside shelter and Alfred Caldwell's landscape featuring an enclosed central meadow, the site has naturally served as a gathering place for groups of all kinds from its opening in 1939. And of course, it has served as a beloved recreation site for all of Chicago's citizens due to its beauty and unique location, providing direct access to Lake Michigan. On behalf of the Commission on Chicago Landmarks, thank you for your time and consideration of the proposed landmark designation of Promontory Point.

[Speaker 1] (56:24 - 56:35)
Thank you. All right. Let's hear from our Alderwoman of the Fifth Ward, who was in the public testimony, said you've been working on this 23 of the 24 years.

[Speaker 33] (56:35 - 58:12)
23 of the 24 years that I've been here yet. And it is a testament to working with your community. And it is also a testament towards time, right?

Getting to yes. Because at the beginning, it was an absolute no. And it was a no from the government, be it the park district, be it the city hall, Army Corps of Engineers, and the tenacity of the community talking about an issue that rallied a community.

This is one and this became a movement and this has been a movement for two decades. And now we are at yes. And I am proud because we were a community.

Some of us knew each other's, others didn't, but we became a family through this process. And the way that I have watched the Point Conservancy, what is now known as that, to evolve. We've had bumper stickers, we've had shirts, we've had rallies, we've got cleanup days.

I mean, this has engulfed the whole community and involved the whole community for the past two decades. And this has kept us together. This has kept us united.

I am very fortunate and grateful to have community residents that are just not there for the day, but are there for the long haul. And so I am forever grateful to them. And I am asking my colleagues to please pass this.

Thank you. Thank you, Alderwoman. And a credit to your tenacity.

[Speaker 1] (58:16 - 1:00:57)
All right, questions, comments, other than my own for the staff or Alderwoman Hairston. Hearing none then Alderman David Moore moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that?

Hearing none, this item will be passed and referred out tomorrow at the city council. Congratulations. I know you were staying to be Alderwoman until you got stunned.

As someone who had to deal with the Northside revetments, I applaud your tenacity. All right, last up on the addendum are large signs over a hundred square feet in area, 24 feet above grade. We will hear them all together.

I will read the ward followed by the address and take a motion at the end. In the fourth ward, eight East ninth street. In the 11th ward, 4330 South Racine Avenue.

Four signs in the 11th ward located at 2201 South Halsted street. One sign in the 12th ward located at 3145 South Ashland. In the 23rd ward, 6918 West Archer.

Four signs in the 27th ward located at 1574 North Kingsbury street. One sign in the 27th ward located at 140 North Halsted. In the 34th ward, 11730 South Marshfield.

In the 40th ward, 5455 North Lincoln Avenue. In the 41st ward, 630 West Cargo Road. 18 signs in the 42nd ward located at 1111 North State.

Six signs in the 42nd ward located at 600 North Wabash. Three signs in the 42nd ward located at 363 West Ontario. One sign in the 42nd ward located at 325 West Ohio.

And lastly, two signs in the 44th ward located at 3519 North Clark. Any questions by committee members? Can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

Alderman Riley makes the motion. Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, these orders will be passed.

We will now move on to the regular agenda in an effort to ensure the committee runs as smoothly as possible. The typical order in which items will be heard has been updated. Items will be grouped together according to witness attorney and will be heard in that order rather than ward order.

Alderman Raymond Lopez has joined us. Let me just ask a question here. We have non-committee members here.

[Speaker 27] (1:00:57 - 1:01:02)
Alderman Quinn is here. His item's after you. His item's right next.

[Speaker 1] (1:01:02 - 1:01:03)
Is it coming up?

[Speaker 27] (1:01:03 - 1:01:03)
Yep.

[Speaker 1] (1:01:03 - 1:01:11)
Okay, I don't want you to wait. Okay, all right. All right, so we're gonna get to you quickly.

All right. So we are on to page one, right? Yes.

Okay.

[Speaker 27] (1:01:12 - 1:01:15)
Okay, I'll just make this the first item and then we'll go to Alderman Quinn.

[Speaker 1] (1:01:16 - 1:02:21)
Oh, well, the first item is in the 44th ward, which I'm gonna ask for a deferral on item number A8778, 44th ward. Ordinance was referred on July 20th of 22. Common address 1235 through 1235 West School and 1240 West Melrose.

Can I get a motion to defer this item? Alderman Hopkins makes the motion to defer this item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, this item will be deferred. Middle of page one, document number A8886. In the 28th ward.

Ordinance was referred on February 1st of 2023. And the common address of this one is 2901 through 2943 West Harrison Street. The change request from C12 neighborhood commercial district to an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district.

We have Patrick here from the department. Alderman Irvin. And Alderman Jason Irvin is not with us today, but you will talk to him about this.

[Speaker 25] (1:02:22 - 1:03:02)
You've already talked to him about it. So Patrick, would you proceed? Yes, Patrick Murphy with the Department of Planning.

Chairman, this is the Alderman of Ordinance essentially takes the residential properties which are zoned in a non-conforming manner now and reverts them to the residential zoning that most closely fits both the development that exists and the residential neighborhood that's already zoned the same to the south. So this is, and it's a multiple, it's nearly the entire block. It's about 90% of the block as far as all the structures that exist.

So it's a very consistent rezoning for residential to get the residential correctly zoned for the properties that exist.

[Speaker 1] (1:03:02 - 1:04:04)
Great. And of course Alderman Irvin is sponsoring it. So he obviously supports it.

Any questions, comments? Otherwise I need a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum that would be made by Alderman Capelman. Any objections to the motion?

Hearing none, this item is passed. All right, bottom of page one, document number A8792 in the 13th Ward. Ordinance was referred on November 4th of 2022.

The common address is 6047 through 6057 West 65th Street. The change request from RT4 residential to flat townhouse and multi-unit district to an RS2 residential single unit detached house district. My understanding is we do have a substitute.

Alderman Capelman moves to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the substitute is before us and we have Alderman Quintin.

[Speaker 28] (1:04:05 - 1:04:37)
Thank you, Mr. Chair, members of the committee. This proposal comes in collaboration with the residents of the 6701 West 64th Place block who over 90% of them have signed a petition in support of the zoning change from RT4 to RS2. I'd like to submit the petition and photos of the property for the record.

I ask a favorable opinion of the committee. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:38 - 1:05:21)
So Marty, just explain over the department why we're doing a substitute on this. Is it an address issue? I believe that's the way I understand it.

So everything- That is correct, Chairman. So it's been properly published and noticed and- Yes, correct, Chairman. All right.

This is the correct address. So the correct address, just for the record, is 6457 through 6447 South Oak Park Avenue. And that is what the petition, so the residents are on board, the aldermen's on board, the department's on board.

[Speaker 27] (1:05:21 - 1:05:23)
That's what was published and that was what was noticed.

[Speaker 1] (1:05:23 - 1:06:24)
Okay, so proper publishing and noticed. So we have our ducks in order. Any questions, comments?

Alderman Mike Rodriguez makes a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? And this item will be passed as substituted, okay?

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Marty. All right, here.

That's for the record, I guess. All right, so now we're on page two and we have document number 8805 in the fourth ward. Ordinance was referred on February 1st of 2023 and the common address is 3654 South Dr. Martin Luther King Drive. And the change request from an RM5 residential multi-unit district to a B31 community shopping district. And this is Alderwoman King is the sponsor of this, but she's not here. Prentice is here?

I'm here.

[Speaker 27] (1:06:24 - 1:06:27)
Okay. As well as Ms. Butler to present on the matter.

[Speaker 1] (1:06:27 - 1:06:53)
All right, well, let's get going. We'll do with Liz and then I'll ask you to opine on behalf of the Alderwoman. Over here, sir.

Right there. Yeah. Very casual.

All right, Liz, you wanna start on this side?

[Speaker 5] (1:06:53 - 1:07:48)
Yes, good morning. Thank you, Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Liz Butler.

I'm a partner at the law firm of Taft Stettinius and Hollister located at 111 East Wacker Drive in Chicago. I represent the property owner in this matter. Before we give our presentation, I wanted to address a housekeeping matter.

We are requesting a substitute of the ordinance. There was an error in the ordinance as introduced and we have shared a draft of the substitute with committee staff and DPD staff this morning. The only change is instead of the B3-1, we need to go to the B3-2.

And the reason for that is that the existing floor area of the building exceeds that allowed under the DASH-1. So the DASH-1 would make the building nonconforming with respect to floor area.

[Speaker 25] (1:07:48 - 1:07:59)
Patrick, would you confirm that, please? That is correct. In addition to the floor area that they're then adding to the structure that exists.

[Speaker 1] (1:07:59 - 1:08:15)
Okay. All right, so Alderman Wogsback moves to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, the substitute is in front of us. We've got an explanation of what it is. So proceed.

[Speaker 5] (1:08:15 - 1:12:55)
Thank you, Mr. Chair. So the property owner has requested a zoning change to go from the RM-5 to the B3-2, and that will facilitate the rehabilitation and reactivation of the long vacant historic building that's located at 3654 South King Drive and shown on the screen above. So this will allow a change of use from residential to mixed use with residential, nonprofit, and commercial uses.

The property is improved with an existing historic, I apologize, let me pause and say that I'm joined today by Angela Ford, who's the Executive Director of the Obsidian Collection Archive, and Anthony Acandelli, who is with Nia Architects, the project architect. So the property is improved with this existing historic three-story structure, as well as a two-story accessory structure in the rear. The existing building was constructed in approximately 1888 and historically was used as a single-family home.

It has been vacant and dormant since approximately 2006. The Obsidian Collection Archives acquired the property in the spring of 2021, and is proposing to rehab and reactivate the site. It'll be used as office for the Obsidian Collection Archive, as well as an archive museum, cultural space.

The property owner proposes to establish a membership-based co-working space with office workspace for members, private rooms for Zoom meetings, reservable conference rooms for collaboration, creative spaces for digital content and podcast creation, and space for curated programming for members, such as networking opportunities, wellness programs, workshops, panels with guest speakers. There would be some limited sales, retail sales of merchandise branded with Obsidian Collection branding, such as T-shirts, totes, kind of like a museum gift shop. There will also be a small cafe serving beverages for members and their guests.

The property would keep two residential dwelling units that would be reserved for fellows or students who are partners with, who are visiting scholars or fellows of partner organizations. And finally, the project will feature programming that will be open to the community, such as wellness programming, cultural or educational programming for children and adults, viewings of cultural exhibits, small-scale screenings of arts and cultural work, community meetings, conversation space, and educational or professional workshops. The scope of work for the physical improvements of the property, as Patrick Murphy mentioned, there is a proposal to add a small addition to the rear of the building, which will add an additional stair for ingress and egress, as well as an elevator making the upper floors accessible.

The scope of work also includes restoration of the exterior facades, planing, tuck pointing of the masonry, as well as the complete interior renovation. So to enable this proposal and allow this approximately $9 million investment in reactivating the property, the property owner is seeking this approval of the change to the B3-2, which is necessary to authorize the change of use from residential to mixed use. We've worked closely with Alderman King and the fourth ward staff, including hosting several community meetings and inviting stakeholder engagement, feedback, and input, which has resulted in the addition of offsite parking.

The zoning change will facilitate the reactivation and preservation of this 135-year-old mansion in a manner that will honor its illustrious past. We thank Alderman King and Prentice for their shepherding this project through this approval process. And we thank the committee for its consideration of this matter.

So we respectfully request your favorable recommendation and we're available to answer any questions that the committee might have. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:12:55 - 1:13:10)
Thank you, Liz. Before we hear from Preston, I would like to, Prentice, I'm sorry. I think I'd like to hear from a little bit about this piece of property, number one.

Is it landmarked already?

[Speaker 5] (1:13:11 - 1:13:13)
It's not landmarked. It's orange rated.

[Speaker 1] (1:13:16 - 1:13:45)
I don't know why this isn't landmarked. We just passed Giles and what I didn't feel was landmarkable, but this is not. There's some inconsistency here.

But that's not my ward, but I just wanted to opine on that one, on both of them, actually. It's open for the future. Yeah.

All right, so let's hear a little bit about this, what actually happens here. You know, a little bit about the organization and could you speak onto that?

[Speaker 26] (1:13:46 - 1:13:46)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (1:13:47 - 1:13:49)
My name is- It's curiosity for me.

[Speaker 26] (1:13:49 - 1:14:57)
Sure. And thank you for entertaining our proposal. My name is Angela Ford.

I am the founder and executive director of the Obsidian Collection Archives, founded six years ago. And our goal is to reclaim the Black narrative and digitize Black archives and make them available for the world to see. Chicago has such an illustrious Black Chicago history that these younger generations haven't been able to really actuate because it's not digitized.

So that's the goal of our organization, but we also want safe spaces for our content creators to use this information and tell wonderful stories. So we purchased what is known in the community as the Lou Palmer Mansion, very celebrated Black journalists from the 70s and 80s and 90s. But we thought this would be the ideal space to renovate, create in the heart of Bronzeville for content creators to work, rest and tell great stories.

[Speaker 1] (1:14:57 - 1:14:58)
Amazing.

[Speaker 26] (1:14:58 - 1:14:59)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:15:00 - 1:15:02)
Francis, would you like to opine on this, please?

[Speaker 13] (1:15:02 - 1:15:52)
Absolutely. So I wanna commend Angela Ford and her team for bringing this transformative project to the forefront. We need to do everything we can to preserve the arts history and culture of our community.

And Angela Ford, through the Obsidian Collection, is doing just that. This project has had a rigorous community outreach process where we've answered questions to the community about how this will be a great partnership between Obsidian Collection and the community. They have gone out of their way to address issues such as parking and other concerns that neighbors have.

And I know this project will be good for the community. It'll be good for the future of Bronzeville. And I would like to commend Ms. Ford for preserving black culture here in the city of Chicago. So much success to her team. I look forward to having a bottle of champagne with you once this project is completed.

[Speaker 1] (1:15:54 - 1:16:02)
Thank you. How about our architect? Would you like to say how we're gonna work on this landmarking of this fabulous building?

[Speaker 23] (1:16:03 - 1:16:50)
Thank you very much. My name is Anthony Akindele, Principal New Architects. We have been actually working with the landmark commissions in how to really restore the exterior of the facade of this building.

So we really work vigorously with the landmarks and with some third-party restoration companies to really bring back the glory days of the building, including the windows, how we restore the windows with cost-effective ways of restoring the windows, the roofs and the interior of the facade. So it was as that the addition in the back is actually to increase the accessibility within the upper levels of the building.

[Speaker 1] (1:16:51 - 1:16:57)
So historically, who built the house?

[Speaker 26] (1:16:58 - 1:17:06)
Judge Hamer built it as for his family, 40 rooms, 15 bathrooms, you know, start a house.

[Speaker 1] (1:17:06 - 1:17:07)
And he was a judge.

[Speaker 26] (1:17:07 - 1:17:31)
He was a judge and he built it to activate that neighborhood and move further away from downtown in the South Loop, I guess, which we call the South Loop now. He wanted to go further South and build an even bigger house for himself. So it took three years to build.

And we learned that through our historic journey with this entire process.

[Speaker 1] (1:17:31 - 1:17:41)
Yeah. Well, the old saying was that the South side had all the luxury in the homes originally. It was not the North side or the Gold Coast.

We had the South Gold Coast.

[Speaker 26] (1:17:41 - 1:17:44)
So it was the World's Fair strategy.

[Speaker 1] (1:17:44 - 1:18:19)
Yeah. Well, fantastic. Any other questions, comments?

Hearing none, I had a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. That would be Alderman Ray Lopez. Any objections to his motion?

Hearing none, this item is passed as substituted. Good luck. I know it's not only a labor of love, but a lot of money that's gonna go into this thing.

And hopefully historic tax credits and some other things to help you. So look forward to being entertained there more or less. So good luck to you.

Thanks, Liz. Thanks, friends. All right.

[Speaker 27] (1:18:19 - 1:18:28)
We'll skip the next item in the third board till staffer is able to- Okay, so we're gonna move. We're not deferring it.

[Speaker 1] (1:18:29 - 1:18:53)
I know, we're just gonna hold an item in the third ward on Calumet until we have a staffer from the third ward. All right. Oh, Lord, we got this thing.

Okay, bear with me. We have many items in the 24th ward and we're gonna read them. What am I, reading them all on the record?

[Speaker 27] (1:18:54 - 1:18:54)
Yeah.

[Speaker 1] (1:18:54 - 1:22:09)
Okay, so bear with me. We're the next 18 items in the 24th ward together. I'll read out each application into the record followed by a short presentation for all the items.

And then we will take a single motion at the end. So in the middle of page two, file number 8808, common address 3243 West Lexington. The change request from an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to an RS3 residential single unit detached house district.

And next is 8809, common address is 3319 West Lexington. The change request RT4 to RS3. Document number 8810, common address is 3540 West Lexington.

Change request RT4 to RS3. We have attorney Steve Friedland to present on these matters.

[Speaker 6] (1:22:10 - 1:27:35)
Good morning. Good morning. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I am here today on behalf of all of these 18 ordinances. This is all obviously being put forward by Alderman Scott, Alderwoman Scott. And we thank her for that.

I'm here on behalf of two not-for-profit clients, the Foundation for Home and Square, which is an umbrella organization in the home and square community and IFF, which is a mission driven lender, developer and consultant working on the project as well. With me today is Eden Herb from IFF. The project, what you see on the screen is a picture of the old Sears Roebuck complex in Lawndale.

And many of you are aware that the home and square development 30 years ago redeveloped the Sears Roebuck facility with new housing, much of it affordable. What was intended to happen or hoped to happen was that some of the housing that is to the north of the Sears complex would start to redevelop with new single family homes and rehabs of some of the existing buildings. And some of that really hasn't happened.

What is before you today is part of a larger city initiative where there's a goal to establish new single family homes up to 1,000 of them in the Chicago area. And what we have before you is just a small group of those, approximately 20 homes that could be developed on these properties. The reason why we're seeking the change is that under the new connected communities ordinance, the property, which is all of these properties are vacant lots that are zoned RT4.

Because this is in a transit serve location under the connected communities ordinance, you cannot build a single family home in an RT4. And there isn't any process under the connected communities ordinance for varying that through an administrative adjustment or something. So the only way to develop these lots as single family homes is to actually down zone them to RS3.

So that's the reason why we're before you today. What is being proposed is a variety of single family homes that would be built on these lots. And the goal, the project goals are to provide high quality housing, create affordable ownership opportunities, single family homes really become the anchor for a community so that we're hoping to re-anchor that home in square area.

This gives you a sense as to what this prototype home looks like. Again, this is gonna be 20 of a thousand homes that the city and other not-for-profits are hoping to do in the city of Chicago. The home buyers will be in the 18 to 120% AMI level.

So this is really a good workforce housing development. The contractor and builder is an organization called Inherent Homes. They are located on the West side.

They're a 60% female and 90% BIPOC employee company. And they will be building these utilizing modular home technology. So these homes are sort of built in a facility and then pieces truck to the site and kind of put together.

The homes will be approximately 1,445 square feet, three bedrooms, two baths, and they're sort of, you know, smart home enabled. There is a variety of housing types. So it's not like these things go up and they look like they're cookie cutter developments.

They will be unique, you know, and there's a number of different designs. These are just three of them that show different facades. And then this gives you a census to the area that we're talking about.

Basically everything on that screen is under one of these 18 ordinances that are before you today with an exception, which is there is, I don't know if this will let me point, it doesn't, but there are four lots that are shown on the southern most site. They're on Polk Street. That's actually not before you today.

Those are located within the planned development of Holman Square and they'll be dealt with differently, but all of the other lots are for single family home development. And we are certainly willing to answer any questions and absolutely thank Alderman Scott for her assistance in moving this forward. Thank you, Steven.

Would you like to say a few words?

[Speaker 38] (1:27:37 - 1:28:02)
I believe Steve has said pretty much everything that needs to be said, but we do just wanna- You are? I'm sorry, Eden Hurd-Smith. I'm a vice president of our community development solutions team at IFF.

We've been working in partnership with Holman Square probably for the past five years to realize their strategic vision of really continuing to redevelop the Holman Square site. And this is a key component is single family home ownership. So we thank you for your consideration of the request.

[Speaker 1] (1:28:02 - 1:28:05)
Appreciate you. Alderman Raboyas.

[Speaker 29] (1:28:05 - 1:28:12)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Great project. Is any of this federally funded?

[Speaker 1] (1:28:14 - 1:28:17)
We are getting- Identify yourself again, for the record.

[Speaker 38] (1:28:19 - 1:28:32)
We are getting dollars for home buyer subsidy that are coming from ARPA funds through the state. Other than that, everything else is funded through privately raised funds that we have raised for the construction of the project.

[Speaker 29] (1:28:32 - 1:28:33)
And what's the timeline on this project?

[Speaker 38] (1:28:34 - 1:28:46)
Yeah, so this is just 2020. This is really the demonstration project for us to work through the kinks of really doing them efficiently. We're planning to do these probably in the next 24 months and then look to bring it to larger scale thereafter to contribute towards the thousand.

[Speaker 29] (1:28:46 - 1:28:49)
Great project. I'd like to see that citywide if possible.

[Speaker 38] (1:28:49 - 1:28:51)
We would love to as well. Thank you.

[Speaker 29] (1:28:52 - 1:28:54)
Good job. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:28:55 - 1:29:01)
You talked about the 80 to 120% of AMI. So what are these houses hopefully listing for?

[Speaker 38] (1:29:02 - 1:29:12)
Yeah, so the sales price is initially 350. We want those to be affordable between 250 and 275 sales price for that deep affordability, which is what we're using the home buyer subsidies for.

[Speaker 1] (1:29:14 - 1:29:50)
Other questions, comments? I know we have the support of the Alderwoman. Can I get a motion to move to pass by the same, hold on a second.

Well, we had a public comment period. Well, wait a second, wait a second. If you want to briefly, just say what you wanna speak at the mic, but it might be a private conversation with the team, but let's with all due respect.

And you are?

[Speaker 27] (1:29:52 - 1:29:53)
Hi, good afternoon.

[Speaker 26] (1:29:54 - 1:30:14)
Shoshua Shields. I own property nearby and I wanted to introduce myself and wanted to make sure that none of what you were building would convey in my property and wanted to exchange phone numbers so that we could speak privately. Okay, great.

[Speaker 1] (1:30:14 - 1:31:54)
So that conversation is a sidebar and you'll make sure that happens. Okay, any other questions, comments? If not, Alderman Wagesbeck makes the motion move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

And those are, let me just repeat because there are 18 of them, Scott. So, same rules and their items, A8808 through A8824. So Alderman Wagesbeck makes the motion move to pass.

Any objections? Hearing not these. What did you, I was praising you and now I.

Okay, let me read it back in the record. The items are A8808 through A8824. So with that, Alderman Wagesbeck makes the motion move to pass.

Any objections? Hearing none, these ordinances are passed. Good luck to you.

We're gonna go a little bit, okay, let me get my, okay. We're gonna go out of order for our Alderman. Bottom of page 19, document number 21044 in the 42nd ward.

Ordinance was referred on June 22nd of 2022. Common address is 426 through 448 East Ontario Street and 427 through 441 East Erie Street. The change request from residential business plan development number 252 to residential business plan development number 252 as amended.

We have Chris Leach.

[Speaker 17] (1:31:55 - 1:31:56)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (1:31:56 - 1:31:59)
And the team here, okay. Thank you. Good morning.

[Speaker 17] (1:31:59 - 1:33:00)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning and members to the committee on zoning landmarks and building standards. My name is Chris Leach and I'm an attorney with offices located at 71 South Wacker Drive.

I'm appearing this morning on behalf of the applicant AH441 Erie LLC in connection with an amendment to residential business plan development number 252. The subject property is located in 42nd ward and bears a common address of 426 through 448 East Ontario Street and 427 through 441 East Erie Street, Chicago, Illinois. Before presenting the details of the proposed amendment, I would like to inform the committee that this application received the unanimous recommendation of the Chicago plan commission at its meeting held on March 16th, 2023.

I respectfully request that the report of proceedings before the plan commission together with all reports and documents previously transmitted to the department of planning and development be incorporated and made a part of the record of this proceeding.

[Speaker 1] (1:33:01 - 1:33:11)
Vice-chair Roboius moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the items are incorporated.

Please proceed.

[Speaker 17] (1:33:11 - 1:35:31)
Thank you. Residential business plan development 252 was originally adopted in 1980 to allow for 594 residential units, office and parking and related uses. PD 252 was last amended in April of 2007, I'm sorry, increasing the unit count to 671 dwelling units and adding general retail sales as a permitted use.

The applicant proposes to amend PD 252 to add hotel as permitted use to allow the renovation of the existing mixed use office and residential building by converting 100,000 square feet of vacant office space into 101 hotel rooms. The hotel component is proposed on level six through 10 of the building and the residential units will remain on the upper levels of the building. There are no proposed exterior changes except for converting an atrium that runs from the sixth to the ninth floors on both sides on the east and west sides of the building into an outdoor terrace or amenity space for the hotel.

Otherwise there are no other exterior changes only interior changes and the exterior landscaping will also remain the same. The economic benefits of the proposed amendment include a $28 million investment in the renovation of an existing building, the build out and activation of currently vacant commercial space, the creation of approximately 75 construction jobs, the creation of approximately 15 to 20 permanent jobs and also a commitment to the MBE, WBE and city residency participation goals of 26, 6% and 50% since this was a dated PD that that provision wasn't originally in there and will be now. The applicant has received letters of support from Alderman Riley and the Streeterville Organization of Active Residents.

I am joined this morning by Christina Olson and Ed Bogocki on behalf of the applicants and on behalf of the applicant, I would like to thank Alderman Riley and the staff of DPD for all their work on this project and ask for your favorable recommendation. We stand ready to answer any questions that you may have. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:35:31 - 1:35:38)
Thank you, Chris. Would any of the two of you would like to make a short comment and maybe some questions then. Alderman Riley.

[Speaker 27] (1:35:40 - 1:35:47)
Thank you, chairman.

[Speaker 31] (1:35:47 - 1:36:44)
I just wanted to reiterate a couple of the key facts. The commercial space in this building has been woefully underutilized and we certainly want to have this an active and successful property. So making this conversion from commercial space to a hotel use, I think is the highest and best use for that space left in the building.

To the applicant's credit, they did visit with the Streeterville Organization of Active Residents, also known as SOAR and have secured their support for the project. There was some issues we needed to tidy up related to safety, which I think were addressed properly by the applicant. And again, there won't be any substantial changes to the exterior of the building with the exception of adding an amenity deck to replace a pretty nasty looking old atrium structure.

But all in all, the neighborhood is supportive of the project and as such, so am I. And I'd encourage my colleagues to provide an aye vote. Thank you, chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:36:45 - 1:37:00)
Thank you, Alderman. Any questions, comments for the team or the Alderman? Hearing none, Vice Chair Roboius moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, this item is passed as revised.

[Speaker 27] (1:37:00 - 1:37:01)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (1:37:01 - 1:37:44)
All right. Now, for Mr. Fritchie. All right, we're gonna, with all due respect, I'm a former state rep in my district, more or less.

So, all right, document number two, we're on page 16 on the top. Document number 22147, 27th Ward. Ordinance was referred on, I'm sorry, March 15th of 2023.

And the common address is 450 North Racine Avenue. The change request from an RT4 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district to B2-2 neighborhood mixed use district. Our witness is John Fritchie.

John.

[Speaker 8] (1:37:45 - 1:38:32)
Thank you, chairman, members of the committee. For the record, John Fritchie on behalf of the applicant, Magnum Homes. The request is sought from the RT4-2 and B2 district to allow for the legal establishment of an existing garage and two dwelling unit building.

There's a substandard lot. The depth is only 105 feet. And so that really jammed them up when it came to having the open space required.

And so in order to do that, they've moved it onto a garage deck. And then we needed the, it triggered other issues with having the stairs connect up to the garage. The request of Alderman Burnett, we did meet with the neighbors of River West.

They had no objection. And we also provided the alderman with letters of support from the surrounding neighbors on both sides and behind the property. We know of no other objections and we respectfully request a do pass.

[Speaker 1] (1:38:32 - 1:38:34)
Thank you, John. Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 22] (1:38:35 - 1:38:52)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. As the council has said, they did meet with the local community organization. They had a community meeting.

They worked in concert with both of the adjacent neighbors. No one in the community object to it. They support it.

I support it as for the committee support.

[Speaker 1] (1:38:53 - 1:39:08)
Questions for the applicant or the alderman? All right. Hearing none, Alderman David Moore moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

[Speaker 8] (1:39:08 - 1:39:10)
Thank you, Chairman. Thank you, Alderman Burnett, members of the committee.

[Speaker 1] (1:39:11 - 1:39:16)
All right, thank you. All right, so now we'll go back to page two.

[Speaker 37] (1:39:16 - 1:39:18)
On top of seven. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:39:18 - 1:39:28)
All right, moving to page seven because we went through those 18 ordinances. Let's see. Where are we at?

Which one are we doing?

[Speaker 27] (1:39:29 - 1:39:30)
Take a motion to defer.

[Speaker 1] (1:39:30 - 1:39:33)
Oh, we're deferring this one?

[Speaker 27] (1:39:33 - 1:39:33)
Right.

[Speaker 1] (1:39:35 - 1:40:49)
Where is Steve Friedland? Did he leave already? Who's deferred?

Okay. All right. I'm gonna read this one at the top of page seven.

It'll be deferred at the request of Alderwoman Dowell. And that item is number 20951 T1 in the third ward. Ordinance was referred on February 23rd of 2022.

And the common address is 5339 through 5353 South State Street, also two through 16 East 54th Street. So I would ask Alderman Kappelman to make a motion to defer on behalf of Alderwoman Dowell. Questions, comments?

No objections. So this item will be deferred. Next is middle of page seven.

And this is document number 22119 T1 in the 48th ward. 1530, common address, 1539 West Devon Street. Change request from B11 Neighborhood Shopping District to B23 Neighborhood Mixed Use District.

And we have Agnes Pleka in this item in 48. Agnes, good morning.

[Speaker 3] (1:40:50 - 1:41:36)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. For the record, my name is Agnes Pleka. I'm an attorney with law office of Jaffe and Berlin LLC located at 111 West Washington.

And I'm here to represent Skituli's Holdings LLC in their proposed rezoning from a B1-1 Neighborhood Shopping District to a B2-3 Neighborhood Mixed Use District for the property located at 1539 West Devon Avenue. And procedural matter, this is a type one application. And we did submit substitute type one plans.

They were very minor revisions. We were tweaking the front elevations to add some masonry to the storefront and to preserve existing columns, but we did submit them. And I would ask that we can proceed on those substitute type one plans and narrative.

[Speaker 1] (1:41:36 - 1:41:48)
Alderman Cardona moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call it was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the substitute is in front of us.

Please proceed.

[Speaker 3] (1:41:48 - 1:44:20)
Thank you, sir. And we are very proud of this project. In today's world, not that many applicants, developers plan to preserve SRO buildings.

This is a property improved with an existing three-story SRO building, which has some commercial units on the ground floor and 12 existing SRO units on the upper floors. And the applicant is fully committed to preserve those SRO units in compliance with the SRO preservation ordinance and maintain the availability of those affordable units in the neighborhood as the SRO ordinance intends. So the applicant proposes to preserve and rehab full interior guard rehab of all the units that are there.

Plus we are proposing to establish three new units on the ground floor at the rear of the building. And those three units will be fully accessible type A units, type A SRO units. So again, affordable units.

So we will have total 15 SRO units within the existing building. There are no changes proposed to the existing FAR or the existing height. Again, only interior rehab and some cosmetic updates for the front elevations with new porches and decks at the rear.

The applicant needs a zoning change in order to comply with the minimum lot area per unit requirements. And we truly believe that this rehab project will advance city's interest in reducing homelessness and supporting diverse economic population within the community. The commercial space on the ground floor will remain and will be occupied by Renison Social Services.

This is a wonderful not-for-profit organization who has been helping vulnerable Chicago residents for the past 20 years. And they will be responsible for the intake and support services for the residents of the building as well as outreach to the community. And we have worked very closely with Alderman Osterman and his chief of staff.

And we had a very extensive outreach to the community. We have met with the Black Lab neighbors. We have met with the Edgewater Chamber of Commerce.

We had an open house by the subject property. We also had two community meetings with notices sent and they were all very well attended. So we had an outpouring of support from the community.

And as a result, Alderman Osterman also supported the project. I don't think he's here today, but we did send his letter of support to the committee prior to- And as we have received the letter of support from Alderman Osterman.

[Speaker 1] (1:44:20 - 1:44:47)
Thank you. Any questions by community members, comments? Would you like to say a few words?

No? Taking all the risk? No, it's exciting, especially the preservation.

I mean, this is in the 48th Ward. This is a huge issue. It's a huge issue for the city.

So yeah, we're working with the city as well and their chosen lender to put it together.

[Speaker 9] (1:44:49 - 1:44:50)
She's for my next case.

[Speaker 3] (1:44:50 - 1:44:51)
I'm sorry.

[Speaker 1] (1:44:51 - 1:45:04)
All right, any other questions, comments? Otherwise Alderman Capelman moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, this item is passed with a substantive narrative and plans.

[Speaker 3] (1:45:04 - 1:45:05)
Thank you, sir.

[Speaker 1] (1:45:05 - 1:45:33)
Okay, bottom of page seven, document number 22109, 30th Ward. Ordinance was referred on March 15th of 2023. Common addresses 5254 through 5256, West Newport Avenue.

And the change request from an RS3, residential single unit detached house district to an RT4, residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district. Again, we have Agnes Plekka on the item in 30.

[Speaker 3] (1:45:34 - 1:48:07)
And again, for the record, my name is Agnes Plekka. I'm an attorney with law firm of Jaffe and Berlin. And I'm here on behalf of MF Investment LLC for this proposed rezoning from RS3, residential single unit detached house district to an RT4, residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district for the property located at 5254-56 West Newport Avenue.

And this is kind of a unique lot, corner lot. It is improved with an old non-conforming residential building with seven dwelling units. The building is spanning across two lots.

So we have a property measuring 60 by 125. The existing building doesn't comply with the MLA requirements, doesn't comply with parking or setbacks and has multiple structural issues. The units are outdated.

Floor plans are just not very livable. So this is not a good candidate for a rehab. Consequently, the applicant proposes to replace the existing seven-unit building with two new three-story residential buildings.

Each building will have three dwelling units. Each new zoning lot will have 30 feet of frontage and will strictly comply with all the setbacks. The proposed redevelopment needs a zoning change to comply with the MLA requirements and maximum floor area.

We have worked very closely with Vice-Chair Lavoris and his team. And as required by his longstanding procedure, we have organized a community meeting with notice sent, which was very well attended. We had a great feedback from that community meeting.

And then again, we met with Alderman and he requested that we incorporate that feedback and revisions to the plans. As a result, we did make some changes and I just wanted to kind of mention a few of those changes. The original plans had a larger duplex units and two simplexes.

So we actually reduced those units. We're gonna have only three simplexes. There will be no living area in the basement.

The basement will only have storage for the residents, which include bike storage. The applicant also provided additional parking and EV charging station. And what was also important to the community, we changed the elevations.

We made them a little bit more traditional. We changed the color of the brick to a dark red with some decorative architectural limestone elements more in keeping with the character of the neighborhood. We notified the community about our changes and based on that, we had a outpouring of support from the neighbors.

And I will turn over to Vice Chair.

[Speaker 1] (1:48:08 - 1:48:09)
Well, I'll turn it over to you.

[Speaker 3] (1:48:09 - 1:48:10)
Thank you, sir.

[Speaker 1] (1:48:11 - 1:48:19)
All right, Vice Chair Roboyas, obviously the community process was exhaustive and made it a better project. You wanna comment on it?

[Speaker 29] (1:48:19 - 1:48:35)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yeah, we entertained a community meeting on the subject matter. There were substantial changes made as a result of what the community requested.

Excuse me one second, excuse me. Stephen, I failed to recognize you here.

[Speaker 1] (1:48:36 - 1:48:58)
Stephen worked in the zoning department. I know you're probably going for lunch, but I just wanna thank you for all the years you've been down here and all the work that you've done. So I'm sorry I didn't do it earlier, Steve.

I was dealing with these 18 applications in the 24th ward, so. Yeah, all right. Good luck to you, all right.

[Speaker 29] (1:48:58 - 1:49:16)
All right, I'm sorry, Ariel. As stated earlier, there were substantial changes made to the project and all these changes were made as to the request by the community. So I'm asking for a favorable support in the subject matter before you.

[Speaker 1] (1:49:16 - 1:49:57)
Any questions for the Alderman and the applicant? Hearing none, Alderman Capelman moves do pass on the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, this item is passed. All right, let me, what are we at the top of, page eight. Again, in the 30th ward, document number 22110, 30th ward, ordinance was referred on March 15th of 2023, common address, 3611 West Belmont Avenue, and the change request from B31 Community Shopping District to B22 Neighborhood Mixed Use District.

Again, Agnes Fleca on this item in 30.

[Speaker 3] (1:49:58 - 1:50:50)
Again, for the record, my name is Agnes Fleca. I'm an attorney with law firm of Jaffe and Berlin, and I'm here on behalf of Mark Serda, Erica Serda, and Gabriel Nelson, who are co-owners of this property in this proposed rezoning from the existing B3-1 Community Shopping District to a B2-2 Neighborhood Mixed Use District for the property located at 3611 West Belmont Avenue. And very simply, this property is improved with an existing non-conforming residential building with three dwelling units.

The applicants fairly recently purchased this property, and while the city was able to certify two of those units, the existing old basement unit, we didn't have any permits for it, so we're just merely- That was Steve Valenciano's- Yes. Okay, now that he's locked, I just wanna say- He was already gone, so he was not able to help us.

[Speaker 1] (1:50:50 - 1:50:51)
All right, continue.

[Speaker 3] (1:50:51 - 1:51:16)
As a matter of fact. Okay. So we're just hoping to legalize and establish a permit record for that old basement unit, and again, we worked very closely with Vice Chair Robores.

The applicants reached out to the neighbors. Nobody had any objections. Everybody was supportive of that proposed rehab, and that's why Vice Chair also decided to hopefully support it, and he will affirm that today.

[Speaker 1] (1:51:17 - 1:51:19)
Ariel, would you comment on this, please? Yes.

[Speaker 29] (1:51:24 - 1:51:27)
So I'm asking for the favorable support in the manner before us.

[Speaker 1] (1:51:28 - 1:51:40)
All right, questions, comments? Hearing none, Alderman Beal makes the motion move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to his motion?

Hearing none, the item is passed. Bottom of page eight.

[Speaker 3] (1:51:40 - 1:51:48)
Thank you, sir. And I just wanted to say to you, Mr. Chairman, and to the Vice Chair, and all Aldermen that are retiring, that we will miss you.

[Speaker 1] (1:51:48 - 1:51:50)
They will miss us dearly.

[Speaker 3] (1:51:50 - 1:51:54)
We shall miss you very much, and we do wish you a happy, happy retirement.

[Speaker 1] (1:51:55 - 1:52:04)
Thank you very much. Okay, in the middle of page eight, we're gonna make a motion to defer because...

[Speaker 27] (1:52:04 - 1:52:05)
You missed that one.

[Speaker 1] (1:52:05 - 1:52:08)
Okay, but who's making them? Is it on behalf of the Aldermen, or?

[Speaker 27] (1:52:09 - 1:52:10)
He has not passed that.

[Speaker 1] (1:52:10 - 1:53:16)
Oh, okay, so this item has not passed planned commission, that being document number 22038, 29th Ward, ordinance was referred on December 14th of 2022. Common address is 5049 through 5133 West Harrison, 601 through 629 South Laramie, 5000 through 5132 West Flournoy, 610 through 628 South Laverne Avenue. And this is a school, if I'm not mistaken, right?

All right, so I need a motion to defer by Alderman Kappelman on behalf of not being at the planned commission. Any questions, objections? Hearing none, this item will be deferred.

All right, bottom of page eight, now we're in the document number 22061, T1, in the 32nd Ward. Ordinance was referred on December 14th of 2022, and the common address is 1887 North Milwaukee Avenue. The change request from B11 Neighborhood Shopping District to B33 Community Shopping District, and we have Dan Lauer on the item in 32.

[Speaker 24] (1:53:16 - 1:53:26)
Mr. Chairman, good morning. This is application 22061, T1, 1887 North Milwaukee. There is a substitute plans and narrative, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:53:26 - 1:53:40)
All right, so Alderman Marboyas moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the substitute is in front of us.

Would you please continue?

[Speaker 24] (1:53:40 - 1:53:54)
I represent Mr. John Cleary of Tyconnell, T-Y-C-O-N-N-E-L-L-C. The application is from B11 to B22 Community Shopping District, there's- Hold on a second, Dan.

[Speaker 27] (1:53:54 - 1:53:54)
Yeah.

[Speaker 1] (1:53:55 - 1:54:14)
I've been informed that we- There's a substitute ordinance as well. Yes. So we need to do that too.

So Alderman Beal moves to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? None, then substitute's before us.

So it's a substitute and a type one changes. Yes, sir. Thank you.

All righty, I'm sorry.

[Speaker 24] (1:54:15 - 1:54:54)
It's an existing muffler shop and it's been vacant for some time. And the proposal is to go to B22, a 4200 square foot Lady Bug and Friends Daycare Facility. They've already signed a letter of intent.

They've paid a deposit. The height is a modest 34 feet, 11 inches, six dwelling units above. There'll be larger three bedroom units.

There's two handicap parking spaces, even though this is equitable transit serve location. We've had several meetings with Alderman Wagaspak and his staff. Bucktown Community Association strongly approves the design and we're grateful for the Alderman's support.

[Speaker 1] (1:54:55 - 1:55:20)
Okay, so Dan, I'm looking at the narrative. I know we've substituted and type one substitute, but at the end of the day, did I hear you correct? You tell me how many units, parking space?

Only six dwelling units, three bedrooms and two- Six three bedrooms. Yes. And parking.

So it's a big reduction from what the original was.

[Speaker 24] (1:55:20 - 1:55:22)
Very big reduction, unfortunately, yeah.

[Speaker 1] (1:55:25 - 1:55:49)
And then you have the daycare on the bottom. Is that correct? That's right, sir.

Okay, all righty. I just wanted to know, because I'm reading one thing and- And can you ask him to also clarify the substitute? All right, I wrote on the substitute from B-1-1 to B-2-2.

That's right. The department has B-2-3. So what is it?

What are we settling on here?

[Speaker 24] (1:55:50 - 1:55:54)
It's B-2-3, but it's type one. So it's limited to those six dwelling units.

[Speaker 1] (1:55:58 - 1:56:08)
But you said B, in your narrative, you said B-2-2. So Anna, let's go ahead.

[Speaker 27] (1:56:08 - 1:56:13)
The organs were received as a- Correct.

[Speaker 24] (1:56:13 - 1:56:17)
I stand corrected. I'm so sorry, B-2-3, I'm sorry, but limited to those six dwelling units.

[Speaker 1] (1:56:19 - 1:56:29)
Okay, so for the record, we're going from a B-1-1 to a B-2-3. That's right. Correct?

[Speaker 27] (1:56:30 - 1:56:31)
Yes, correct, the substitute.

[Speaker 1] (1:56:32 - 1:56:33)
So now we need another correction?

[Speaker 27] (1:56:33 - 1:56:35)
Correct the narrative file.

[Speaker 1] (1:56:35 - 1:56:39)
Oh, so read that into the record, what we just said. So it's for the record.

[Speaker 24] (1:56:41 - 1:56:49)
It's a B-2-3 with a limitation on the type one to six dwelling units above commercial.

[Speaker 1] (1:56:52 - 1:56:53)
You good with that?

[Speaker 27] (1:56:54 - 1:57:06)
Alderman Wegesbeck supports a B-3-2, not a B-3-3. I have a B-2-3-3, the narrative has a B-2-3-2.

[Speaker 1] (1:57:07 - 1:57:10)
So is he, is Scott here?

[Speaker 27] (1:57:11 - 1:57:40)
His letter of support is being amended to a B-3-2 instead of the originally requested B-3-3. Hold on a second, hold on a second. Tell me that.

Why don't you hold it? I don't know. Well, just hold on.

We've talked about this enough. Let me just see, let me see what he's doing here. Turn it.

[Speaker 24] (1:58:05 - 1:58:29)
That's fine. He was very, he was adamant it would be a dash two, Mr. Chairman. The alderman was very adamant it remain a dash two.

And I believe that's the ordinance that was dropped off. The ordinance and the narrative. It may be a matter of just correcting a typo on the ordinance that was given to you, Ms. Robles.

[Speaker 27] (1:58:37 - 1:58:42)
If we could file for the dash two, six units are allowed for the minimum lot area.

[Speaker 8] (1:58:47 - 1:58:50)
Yes, to take the dash two. To change to a B-3-2.

[Speaker 1] (1:58:52 - 1:58:54)
Alderman is okay with the B-3-2.

[Speaker 27] (1:58:57 - 1:59:03)
Alderman's good with B-3-2. B-3-2, okay, we're good, we're good.

[Speaker 1] (1:59:03 - 1:59:15)
Okay, so let me just say this one more time, Dan. You'll repeat after me. We're changing this from a B-1-1 neighborhood shopping district to a B-3-2 community shopping district.

[Speaker 24] (1:59:16 - 1:59:17)
Actually, we prefer a B-3-2.

[Speaker 1] (1:59:17 - 1:59:18)
That's a type one.

[Speaker 24] (1:59:18 - 1:59:29)
Yeah, we prefer a B-2-2, but it's gotta be a dash two. And I believe that's the ordinance that was dropped off to staff, but.

[Speaker 1] (1:59:30 - 1:59:47)
All right, you know what we're gonna do? We're gonna hold this. We're not deferring it.

We need to get our act together, okay? So we're all on the same page. Okay, Dan?

Okay. I don't wanna delay it, but I wanna be copacetic. Thank you, thank you, Mr. Chair. All right, so that will be held.

[Speaker 27] (1:59:47 - 1:59:49)
During the top one. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:59:49 - 2:01:03)
All right. So we're gonna ask a motion to defer this item in 46. That being 22135-T1, 46th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on March 15th of 2023. The change, common address, 4655 through 4657 North Broadway and the change requests from B-3-2, Community Shopping District to B-2-5, Neighborhood Mixed Use District. And Alderman Capelman, you wanna defer this?

All right, so Alderman Rodriguez makes a motion to defer this item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the item will be deferred.

All right, next, middle of page nine, document number 22131-T1 in the 46th Ward. Ordinance was referred on March 15th, 2023. And the common address is 4701 North Clark Street.

The change requests from B-3-2, Community Shopping District to B-2-3, Neighborhood Mixed Use District. Sarah Barnes, please.

[Speaker 2] (2:01:04 - 2:01:07)
Thank you. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:01:07 - 2:01:11)
We got a lot of items from you, so please be brief, okay? I'm looking at the.

[Speaker 2] (2:01:11 - 2:01:14)
My last one was Alderman Capelman.

[Speaker 1] (2:01:14 - 2:01:15)
Let's go on this one.

[Speaker 2] (2:01:16 - 2:04:34)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and esteemed committee men. For the record, my name is Sarah Barnes and I'm an attorney with the lobsters of Sam Banks. I'm here this afternoon on behalf of the applicant 4701 North Clark Street, Incorporated.

I am very happy to be here presenting the proposal to the committee. This, our last proposal with Alderman Capelman. This development was construed pursuant to the new Connected Communities Ordinance.

And I think it does demonstrate and reflect the intent of the Connected Communities Ordinance on multiple levels, all the way from design to function. Towards that end, we have spent the last over 14 months with Alderman Capelman and the relevant community organizations, including the Clark Street Association and the Uptown United Chamber of Commerce, as well as the Dover Street residents and all of the neighbors in the immediately impacted area towards the programming for this proposal. I can say that this truly was a collaborative effort with the community and I will commend Alderman Capelman on encouraging and facilitating a robust community review towards this project because it truly ended up a much better project in the end after that 14 months.

Towards that end, the proposal calls for the construction of a new five-story mixed use building at the subject site, which is located directly across the street from Chase Park. The programming for the new proposed building includes a commercial unit on the first floor as well as residential amenity space and interior parking for 18 vehicles, which is the maximum 50% allotment per dwelling unit pursuant to the Connected Communities Ordinance. Towards that same end, the proposal calls for a total of 36 dwelling units to be located on and between the second through fifth floors, which will represent a mixed variety of one bedroom, two bedroom, and even three bedroom units.

Along those same lines, I'm happy to report that there will be a total of seven ARO units designated for this new development per our ongoing community review and our correspondence with the Department of Housing. The method of compliance for those affordable units will be four will be provided onsite and again will reflect a one bedroom, two bedroom and three bedroom unit. And an in lieu fee will be paid to the Affordable Housing Opportunity Fund for the other three units, which Alderman Kappelman, I believe has some projects that are in need of these additional funds.

So it's gonna have a broader impact on the entire Uptown community. With that, we do have the support of the Clark Street Association, as well as Uptown United and Alderman Kappelman is here and may be able to speak further to any additional comments.

[Speaker 1] (2:04:35 - 2:04:35)
Thank you, Sarah.

[Speaker 2] (2:04:35 - 2:04:36)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:04:36 - 2:04:36)
James.

[Speaker 39] (2:04:37 - 2:04:49)
Thank you, Chairman. This also supports our Clark Street study as well. So I wanna thank DPD for their input and ask my colleagues for their support.

[Speaker 1] (2:04:51 - 2:05:14)
Alrighty, questions, comments for the applicant or the Alderman? Hearing none, Alderman Villegas makes a motion move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to his motion?

Hearing none, the item is passed. Vice Chair is gonna take over in the 44th board and we do have some refreshments or sandwiches in 201A.

[Speaker 27] (2:05:14 - 2:05:16)
No, no, we moved all the way to 200.

[Speaker 1] (2:05:20 - 2:05:26)
Anyways, we have sandwiches in room 200 for committee members and all the persons in general.

[Speaker 29] (2:05:27 - 2:06:00)
So. All right, we're in the bottom of page nine in the 44th ward, file number 22130, referred on March 15th, 2023. Common address known as 3731-3733, North Sheffield.

The change request is an RT4 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district to an RM5 residential multi-unit district. We have with us Council Sarah Barnes, you may proceed.

[Speaker 2] (2:06:01 - 2:07:47)
Thank you so much, Vice Chair. I can't believe I'm going to be saying this for the last time to you, but you will be sorely missed. Good afternoon, once again, for the record, my name is Sarah Barnes and I'm an attorney with the Lofts of Sandbanks.

Happy to be here on behalf of Wrigleyville Flats LLC, who is seeking a zoning map amendment in order to permit the rehabilitation and expansion of the existing three-story multi-unit residential building at the subject site to encourage better use of the subject property. The programming for the new renovations and improvements calls for the erection of a new four-story lateral addition and a new one-story vertical addition off of the north side and at the top of the existing building, as well as the internal reconfiguration of the seven existing dwelling units and one newly proposed dwelling unit, which will result in the establishment of a total of eight dwelling units at the subject property. Due to its close proximity to the Addison CTA station, the applicant is proposing to add only, and because they are adding only one dwelling unit, the proposal calls for interior garage parking for six vehicles. With that, we have presented this proposal to Alderman Tunney and as well to Alderman-elect Lawson and also went through several rounds of review with the East Lakeview Neighbors Association, who, after some design changes, have offered their support of the proposal and we very respectfully would request the committee's support as well.

[Speaker 29] (2:07:49 - 2:07:54)
Thank you, Sarah. It's my understanding that Chairman-elect will speak on this matter.

[Speaker 4] (2:07:54 - 2:07:56)
Chairman-elect, Alderman-elect.

[Speaker 29] (2:07:56 - 2:07:58)
Chairman-elect.

[Speaker 4] (2:07:58 - 2:08:02)
No, no, no. Hi, I'm Bennett Lawson. I'm the Chief of Staff to Alderman Tom Tunney.

[Speaker 7] (2:08:03 - 2:08:30)
Speaking on this item, which the community is in favor of, as is our office, some of the things Sarah didn't mention, this backs up to the Red Line, so it's a good spot for some density. It's about a half a block north of the Bleacher Gate at Wrigley Field. The project also has a preservation element where we're preserving a long-term three-flat graystone while adding a modern building to the vacant side yard.

So this has the support of our office, the community, and we ask for your favorable consideration.

[Speaker 29] (2:08:30 - 2:08:37)
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, sir.

Any questions by committee members? Just a question.

[Speaker 1] (2:08:38 - 2:09:30)
You heard two public comments in opposition to this. Bennett, were you here for that? Well, I was.

Mr. McNally, I think, was one, and Pam, whatever. So out of character was a comment. One immediate neighbor, which I know you are aware of, was worried about his solar panels that he would like to erect.

The other woman was a neighbor across the street that was worried about the shadow study in terms of her access to light. But I didn't discuss that during the public comment period, but this did go through. They had obviously got noticed.

They were, correct me if I'm wrong, a number of meetings, a couple of them? Yes. With the East Lakeview neighbors?

[Speaker 2] (2:09:31 - 2:09:55)
Several. And then I actually spoke with the neighbor across the street regarding the height as well. And I believe that the architect's office is doing a shadow study, even though the CTA is actually, the elevated line is actually taller than our building will be.

And we are in the Wrigleyville tall building, special overlay district.

[Speaker 1] (2:09:55 - 2:09:56)
What is the overall, the height?

[Speaker 2] (2:09:56 - 2:10:13)
Yeah, the overlay district, which encourages the height. So, but I did have very active conversation with her. I think I spoke with her for over a half hour.

And yes, this went through several rounds of meetings with East Lakeview Neighbors Association.

[Speaker 1] (2:10:14 - 2:10:19)
Because there were two public comment period, I wanted to make sure that we addressed that on the record.

[Speaker 2] (2:10:19 - 2:10:24)
Thank you so much. I did not have an opportunity to talk to Mr. McNally, but.

[Speaker 1] (2:10:25 - 2:10:34)
I know Bennett did. All right, that was, that's my comment. Well, here, you want to address Alderman Caplan?

[Speaker 29] (2:10:34 - 2:10:35)
Alderman Caplan?

[Speaker 39] (2:10:35 - 2:11:12)
Just want to make a very quick statement, because I know this comes up a lot, that people are concerned about their block sunlight. And I get it. I had a four-story building go up directly behind my condominium that blocks my morning sunlight.

The fact of the matter is we don't own sunlight. And if we always block developments because they block sunlight, we just wouldn't have developments. We wouldn't have a downtown district.

So I get people's feelings about it. My husband's a gardener. He did not like the loss of sunlight, but we're living in a big city.

That's it. Thank you, Chair.

[Speaker 29] (2:11:15 - 2:11:30)
Thank you. Alderman Burnett, motion to do pass. The same rule called determined quorum.

Any objections? All in favor of this motion to do pass. All right.

The leader of the city council.

[Speaker 1] (2:11:31 - 2:11:34)
Thank you. We have one more item. Is that correct, Sarah?

[Speaker 2] (2:11:35 - 2:11:46)
Two more. Diversity's being deferred. Oh, I spoke with Alderman Wengeslick earlier.

He said to go ahead with both of them.

[Speaker 1] (2:11:47 - 2:11:48)
Well, let's do this.

[Speaker 2] (2:11:48 - 2:11:49)
We can do Webster.

[Speaker 1] (2:11:49 - 2:12:07)
Let's do Webster first, okay? Document number 22128 in the 32nd Ward. Ordinance was deferred on March 15th of 2023.

Common address is 2018 through 2020 West Webster Avenue. And the change request from B32, Community Shopping District, to B23, Neighborhood Mixed Use District. Sarah?

[Speaker 2] (2:12:08 - 2:13:15)
Thank you so much. Once again, Mr. Chairman and esteemed members of the committee, my name is Sarah Barnes, and I'm an attorney at the losses of Sam Bank. Happy to be here this afternoon on behalf of Development Group, LLC Bucktown, presenting a proposal that if approved will permit the construction of a new four-story six-unit residential building with onsite accessory parking for six vehicles at the subject property.

We started this proposal with Alderman Wengeslick, and then as well had went through a series of review meetings with the Bucktown Community Organization, who through their review, we made some tweaks to the plan, and we were able to garner their support. As well, a restrictive covenant will be recorded against the property to ensure full compliance or substantial compliance with the design that was proposed and presented to the community organization. With that, I know Alderman Wagesback said that he had to step out for an hour or so, but we do have his- We do, on this item, we do have a lot of support from Alderman Wagesback.

[Speaker 1] (2:13:16 - 2:13:33)
Thank you, Sarah. Any questions, comments? Hearing none, Alderman Beal makes a motion.

Do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, this item is passed.

All right, where are we at?

[Speaker 27] (2:13:35 - 2:13:39)
They're gonna call back. So Sarah, hang tight. No problem.

[Speaker 1] (2:13:40 - 2:13:50)
All right, but now we have Mr. Lauer is coming back, again, in the 32nd Ward. So let me go back. Come on down, Dan.

What page was that one on?

[Speaker 19] (2:13:51 - 2:13:51)
Final Ward.

[Speaker 1] (2:13:51 - 2:13:57)
Okay, bottom of page eight. After lengthy discussion with everybody.

[Speaker 24] (2:14:02 - 2:14:17)
Was sent in, it started as a B or as a dash three. The Alderman was very adamant about a dash two. Unfortunately, there was a typo that no one caught at the bottom of the ordinance.

It should be approved as B11 to B22, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:14:21 - 2:15:42)
It's type one, B11 to B22. And Alderman Wagesback is fine. The department's fine.

Thank goodness. All right, with that, can I get a motion to move, do pass, on the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? That would be Vice Chair Roboius.

And what are we doing this? Oh, yes, as amended. All right, so this item is passed as amended.

And with what? Substantive narrative. Oh God, and with substantive narrative and plans.

Okay, believe me if I tell you, right? All right, that's it on that one. We've still got more to do in 32, I think.

But I think, are we done with you? Thanks so much, Mr. Chairman, for everything. All right, so.

All right, the middle of page 10 we're holding until we get. Okay, bottom of page 10, document number 22117, 45th Ward, ordinance was referred on March 15th of 2023. Common address is 4401 through 4411 North Milwaukee Avenue.

Also 5040 through 5048 West Montrose Avenue in the change request from B11 Neighborhood Shopping District to B31 Community Shopping District.

[Speaker 28] (2:15:42 - 2:16:42)
Andrew Scott, are you here for Andrew? Yes, I'm filling in for Andrew today. Great, so identify yourself.

For the record, my name is Aaron Dorsey, the law offices of Dicomagaset. I'm an attorney as well. I'm sorry, the last name again?

Dorsey, D-O-R-S-E-Y. All right, proceed, please. And we are representing the applicant Mott Mill LLC in its application to rezone the property located at 4401 to 4413 North Milwaukee Avenue, also known as 5040 to 5048 West Montrose Avenue from the B11 Neighborhood Shopping District to the B31 Community Shopping District for the purposes of allowing a tenant at the subject property to be classified as a general restaurant, which will allow the tenant to pursue an incidental leaker license for the business. The applicant has held a community meeting and we have sent out the required notice to the surrounding property owners and have not received any opposition to this application. We have also briefed Alderman Gardner about the application and have received a letter of support which should be on file with the committee.

[Speaker 1] (2:16:42 - 2:16:50)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Gardner. Do we have an identified restaurant?

[Speaker 28] (2:16:51 - 2:17:04)
I believe, yes, I do not have the name. It is a breakfast and brunch restaurant. Not a Swedish one.

I hope it is not. I guess this is capitalism, right?

[Speaker 1] (2:17:05 - 2:17:09)
So, all right, we do have a letter of support from Gardner and I'm sorry, one last question, parking?

[Speaker 28] (2:17:10 - 2:17:18)
Yes, there's parking behind the building. I believe 14 spaces. Okay, all right, sure.

Any other questions, comments?

[Speaker 1] (2:17:20 - 2:17:32)
Hearing none, Alderman Burnett moves do pass. Same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, the item is passed. Good luck. Thank you, Jim.

All right, now we're, what are we at? Bottom of page 11?

[Speaker 27] (2:17:32 - 2:17:35)
We have to take a motion to defer these two items.

[Speaker 1] (2:17:35 - 2:19:04)
Okay, so the next two items in the 45th Ward, I'll read them separately, right? Because we have to defer each one. All right, I'll read the number, that first one being 22144T1 in the 45th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on March 15th of 2023 and the common address is 5411 West Higgins. The next item subsequent to that is document number 22145T1 in the 45th Ward. Ordinance again referred on March 15th of 2023.

This common address is 40, I'm sorry, 5415 West Higgins. So these are going to be deferred on behalf of Alderman Gardner, is that correct? Nicole, is this on behalf of the, all right.

Both of these are being deferred on behalf of Alderman Gardner. Alderman Capel makes a motion to defer both these items by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, both of these items on Higgins will be deferred. Bottom of page 11, document number 22138, 31st Ward. Ordinance was referred on March 15th of 2023.

And this common address is 5400 West Diversity Parkway. It's not Parkway, Diversity is a street at that far West.

[Speaker 15] (2:19:05 - 2:19:07)
Yeah, it's Avenue, I believe.

[Speaker 1] (2:19:07 - 2:19:30)
Pardon me? I believe it's Avenue. I know so, and I don't want to tell you why.

It's a Parkway to Western, and West of Western, it is a street. All right. To change request at 5400 West Diversity Street is from a B11 Neighborhood Shopping District to B31 Community Shopping District.

Nick Fatikas.

[Speaker 15] (2:19:30 - 2:20:06)
Good afternoon, Chairman. Nick Fatikas from the Law Offices of Sam Banks. I'm here on behalf of the applicant and property owner, AASJM Incorporated.

The owner currently operates a gas station and small retail convenience store at the subject property. The applicant is proposing to expand the convenience store building. And in order to do so, we need a zoning change from the B1 District to the B3 District to allow the expansion of the gas station use.

We have worked with Alderman Cardona and a letter of support should already be on file. I'd be happy to answer any questions about the project.

[Speaker 1] (2:20:06 - 2:20:50)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Cardona. And any questions, comments? Hearing none, Alderman Ravois makes a motion move to pass by the same roll call that was used at the Chairman Quorum.

Any objections to the motion? Hearing none, this item is passed. Top of page 12.

Document number 22133, T1 in the 26th Ward. Ordinance was referred on March 15th of 2023 and the common address is 3508 West Armitage Avenue. And the change request from B31 Community Shopping District to B23 Neighborhood Mixed Use District.

Nick, we have this item in 26, please.

[Speaker 15] (2:20:50 - 2:21:49)
Thank you. Again, Nick Fitikas for the record. I'm here on behalf of the applicant and property owner 3508 West Armitage LLC.

The applicant is proposing an extensive renovation and actually addition project to the existing mixed use building at the property. Today, there's a retail unit and four residential units. And if the zoning change is allowed, it would permit a rear addition and an increase from four units to five residential units.

We are proposing to maintain the retail unit as well. We have worked directly with Alderman Maldonado on this project, and we have offered to make the new fifth residential unit to offer it at, although it's not a legal, legally required affordable unit, we would market it at an affordable rent. Based on that commitment, the Alderman has issued a letter of support, which again should be on file.

And I'd be happy to answer any questions you or the members have for this project.

[Speaker 1] (2:21:50 - 2:23:34)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Maldonado. Questions, comments? Hearing none, Alderman Burnett makes a motion move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed. Just an FYI, you guys, we do have sandwiches in 200.

Hey, it's around lunchtime. We still have a little bit more to go. All right, the next three items we will hear together, I'll read them all in the third ward, and we will make one presentation from Nick, all right?

So middle of page 12, document number 22139, ordinance was referred on March 15th of 2023. Common address is 5408 South Dearborn, and the change request from RS3, residential single unit detached house district to RT4, residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district. Next item, number 22140, again in the third ward, ordinance was referred on March 15th of 2023.

This common address 5410 South Dearborn, and the change request again from an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RT4 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district. And the next item, number 22141, third ward, ordinance was referred on March 15th of 2023. Common address is 5440 South Dearborn Street, and the change request from an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RT4 residential two flat townhouse district, townhouse and multi-unit district.

Okay, so all three, they're on the same block?

[Speaker 15] (2:23:35 - 2:23:39)
They are on the same block, two I believe are adjacent, and then the last is separated.

[Speaker 1] (2:23:39 - 2:23:42)
So we'll take them all together, would you explain what we're doing here in the third ward?

[Speaker 15] (2:23:43 - 2:24:38)
Thank you, Chairman, again, Nick Fitikas for the record. The applicant is seeking to actually purchase all three of these properties from the city of Chicago, currently publicly owned land. He's worked directly with the Department of Housing, as well as Alderman Dowell's office on that process.

The goal is to purchase the property and redevelop currently vacant land with a series of three, two unit buildings. One of the issues in this case is that each of the lots is only 97 feet deep. So in order to meet the lot area total for a two unit building on each of the three properties, a zoning change is required from RS3 to RT4.

Again, each building will be 38 feet in height, there'll be two residential units, and two rear parking spaces provided for each property. We've worked again, directly with Alderman Dowell, we believe we have her support to proceed. And I do know that there's a staff person here as well.

Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:24:39 - 2:24:48)
Brian is here from Alderman Dowell's office, would you comment on these three items on Dearborn, please?

[Speaker 20] (2:24:48 - 2:24:49)
Of course, thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 21] (2:24:49 - 2:25:13)
My name is Brian Friedman, third ward Alderman Pat Dowell's office. We fully support this project, the developer Kamal Murray is a great partner for the ward. He does the adjacent access tennis facility, which has brought in world-class athletes and tennis players and community engagements.

This will help assist with housing for some of the staff and some people who want to be associated with that development. So we fully support the project, thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:25:15 - 2:26:39)
I know what a champion Alderman Dowell is of her tennis facility. So it's interesting to see that this is in conjunction with that. So any questions for Nick or Brian from the Alderman's office?

Hearing none, Alderman David Moore, moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum on items number, there's three of them on number, number 22139, that's 5408 South Dearborn, number 22140, which is 5410 South Dearborn, and document number 22141 at 5440 South Dearborn. So all three items, one motion by David Moore, any objections? Hearing none, these three items are passed.

While we have Brian here from Alderman Dowell's office, I'm gonna go back to page two and read this one into the record. That's Aldermanic 8790 in the Third Ward. Ordinance was referred on October 26th of 2022, common address 1910 South Calumet, and the change request from the DX3, Downtown Mixed Use District to a DR3, Downtown Residential District.

On behalf of Alderman Dowell, Brian.

[Speaker 21] (2:26:39 - 2:27:23)
Thank you again, Chairman. Again, Brian Friedman, Third Ward Alderman Pat Dowell's office, 1910 South Calumet. That's kind of an interesting case.

It's currently an armory that's being used by the National Guard. They are no longer going to use the armory anymore, opening it up for sale. The sale is something that's gonna have to get approval from the state legislature and the governor.

This is a primarily middle-dense residential neighborhood, and Alderman Dowell wants to make this change to the zoning in order to get some community control and input on whatever building is going to be built at that site with approval of the state legislature and the governor.

[Speaker 1] (2:27:24 - 2:27:30)
So it's owned by the state? It certainly is. And it's any historic significance?

[Speaker 21] (2:27:31 - 2:27:46)
The building itself, no. It's just kind of a not great looking windowless brick building that the Guard used for training purposes. But should they sell it to a developer that wants to put up something that's not consistent with the community, we want to retain a little bit of community input and control.

[Speaker 1] (2:27:47 - 2:28:05)
So basically future land use planning? Exactly right. Okay, questions for the Alderman's office?

Hearing none, can I get a motion to move, do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderman David Moore makes that motion. Any objections to his motion?

Hearing none, the item is passed.

[Speaker 21] (2:28:05 - 2:28:06)
Thank you so much, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:28:06 - 2:28:43)
All right, let me just make sure we are now middle of page 13, document number 22137 in T1 in the first ward ordinance was referred on March 15th of 2023. Common address is 1923 West Race Avenue. Change request from an RS3, residential single unit detached house district to an RT3.5, residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district. Nick Patikas in the first ward.

[Speaker 17] (2:28:43 - 2:28:44)
Again, thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 15] (2:28:44 - 2:29:44)
Nick Patikas from the Law Offices of Sam Banks. I'm here on behalf of the applicants and property owners, James and Mindy Kniebel. The owners currently occupy the single family home at 1923 West Race.

The lot is the issue in this case. It measures 24 feet wide by only 95 feet deep and they're proposing a one story rear addition, a mudroom addition at the very rear of the home. In order to support the new floor area total, the applicants are requesting a zoning change from the RS3 district to the RT3.5 district. We did work directly with Alderman LaSpada's office. We also met with the CGNA Community Association as well as a handful of neighbors on our side of the block of the street. And we've received support to proceed today.

We did send an email from Alderman LaSpada's office that I had forwarded to Nicole. I'm not certain whether a separate no objection letter was provided, but we did send that yesterday.

[Speaker 1] (2:29:45 - 2:29:48)
We have a letter of support from Alderman LaSpada.

[Speaker 15] (2:29:48 - 2:29:55)
Great, and with that, that concludes my presentation. I'd be happy to answer any questions you or the committee members have about our project.

[Speaker 1] (2:29:56 - 2:30:52)
Committee members, questions, comments? Hearing none, Alderman Beal makes the motion move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to his motion?

Hearing none, the item is passed. Thank you. Bottom of page 13, document number 22126, 29th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on March 15th of 2023. And the common addresses, 7152 through 7190 West North Avenue, 1601 through 1657 North Harlem, 7153 through 7191 West Wabansa, Wabansia, 1600 through 1636 West, or I'm sorry, North Neva. Change request from plan development number 1449 to B3-2 Community Shopping District.

Tyler Manick, good afternoon, sir.

[Speaker 7] (2:30:53 - 2:32:39)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Tyler Manick with Shames, Ains, Penny and Schwartz. I'm here on behalf of the applicant, Harlem and North Development LLC, who owns the subject property at 7152 to 7190 West North Avenue, 1601 to 1657 North Harlem Avenue, 7153 to 7191 West Wabansia, and 1600 through 1636 North Neva, which is a five and a half acre parcel bounded by North Avenue, Harlem Avenue, Wabansia and Neva.

In July, 2019, the predecessor owner rezoned this parcel to a residential business plan development 1449 to construct a mixed use development containing ground floor commercial space with 161 dwelling units. After determining the project was no longer feasible for them, the predecessor owner sold this property to the applicant who does not intend to construct the plans subject to PD 1449. Consequently, the applicant seeks to sunset the PD to a B3-2 Community Shopping District, which is the zoning district called out in statement number 17 of the PD in the event that the PD is not developed and section 1713-0612 of the Chicago Zoning Ordinance.

The applicant has worked closely with the alderman on this project and participate in a community meeting on March 20th to discuss this application. As a result of these efforts, the applicant has submitted a letter of support to this committee from the alderman. With the support of the alderman, I respectfully request this committee's favorable support to rezone the parcel bounded by North Avenue, Harlem, Wabandia, and Neva from PD 1449 to B3-2.

And I'd be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (2:32:41 - 2:32:43)
My question is, was this the Sears site?

[Speaker 27] (2:32:44 - 2:32:44)
Correct.

[Speaker 1] (2:32:47 - 2:32:49)
And it's not feasible with 100 and some units on it?

[Speaker 40] (2:32:51 - 2:32:53)
Not according to my client.

[Speaker 1] (2:32:53 - 2:32:59)
Because I know the alderman was supportive of this and it was somewhat controversial if I recall.

[Speaker 7] (2:33:00 - 2:33:13)
Yeah, I did not participate in the original entitlements. So I don't know exactly what happened, but my owner or my clients more of a commercial developer than a residential.

[Speaker 1] (2:33:15 - 2:33:23)
Now I recall it fairly distinctly because it went to Planning Commission first, I think.

[Speaker 7] (2:33:23 - 2:33:30)
Yeah, and there's also a site directly to the west, which is a townhome development that also went through Planning Commission.

[Speaker 1] (2:33:30 - 2:33:31)
Did that ever materialize?

[Speaker 7] (2:33:31 - 2:33:33)
That's moving forward.

[Speaker 1] (2:33:33 - 2:34:20)
All right, well, we do have a letter of support from Alderman Talaferro. Any other questions or comments? Hearing none, Vice Chair, Roboius moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, this item is passed, sunsetted. All right, let's see, top of page 14, document number 22127, T1 in the fifth ward.

Ordinance was referred to March 15th of 2023 and the common address is 6629 South Maryland. The change request from an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to an RM4.5 residential multi-unit district. Tyler Manick again in the fifth ward now.

[Speaker 7] (2:34:20 - 2:35:18)
Thank you again, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Tyler Manick of Shane Banks Kenyon Shorts. I'm here on behalf of the applicant Eagle OZB2LP, which owns the property at 6629 South Maryland.

Currently 6629 South Maryland is a vacant lot zoned RT4. The owner seeks a zoning map amendment to rezone this parcel to RM4.5 in order to develop the parcel with a three-dwelling unit building with a height of 32 feet and a three-car garage. The rezoning will allow the applicant to add third bedrooms to each of these units and provide family size units that were desired by the community.

The applicant has met with Alderwoman Harrison to discuss this project and participate in a fifth ward community meeting on January 24th. Based on the universal support at the community meeting, Alderwoman Harrison submitted to this committee her letter of support, which you should have on file.

[Speaker 1] (2:35:19 - 2:35:21)
We do have a letter of support from Alderwoman Harrison.

[Speaker 7] (2:35:21 - 2:35:36)
With the support of the Alderwoman, I respectfully request this committee's favorable recommendation to approve a zoning map amendment for 6629 South Maryland from an RT4 to an RM4.5 zoning district. And I'd be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (2:35:36 - 2:35:38)
So Tyler, is this a standard lot?

[Speaker 7] (2:35:38 - 2:35:39)
It is.

[Speaker 1] (2:35:39 - 2:35:47)
So the idea of having larger units is the reason because you obviously can build three units. So it's extra large units with more of the FAR?

[Speaker 7] (2:35:48 - 2:35:51)
Yes, correct. Add the third bedroom.

[Speaker 1] (2:35:51 - 2:35:53)
The height, this is our...

[Speaker 7] (2:35:53 - 2:35:55)
It's 32, so it's below RT4.

[Speaker 1] (2:35:56 - 2:36:38)
Okay. All right. Well, Alderman did her process and we do have a letter of support.

Any other comments, questions? Hearing none, Alderman Beall makes the motion move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, the item is passed. Now we're at middle of page 14, document number 22124 in the second ward. Ordinance was referred to March 15th of 2023.

Common address is 162 West Superior Street and the change request from a DX5 Downtown Mixed Use District to a DR5 Downtown Residential District. Again, Tyler Manick.

[Speaker 7] (2:36:39 - 2:37:49)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Tyler Manick of Shane Banks, Kenyon-Schwartz. I'm here on behalf of the applicant, Mother Superior LLC, which owns a property at 162 West Superior.

162 West Superior is a small lot, 50 foot by 50 foot, and is approved with a six story building last used as a school. At the onset of the pandemic, the school closed. For the past three years, the owner sought to activate the building with many different uses to no avail.

And it's currently vacant. With this rezoning, the owners seek to relocate their residents to the city and convert the building to their single family residence. To do so, they will not be changing the massing or appearance of the building, but will do so through interior renovations.

There will also be two indoor parking spaces provided. The applicant has met with Alderman Hopkins, who has submitted to this committee a letter of support. With the support of Alderman Hopkins, I respectfully request a zoning map amendment from a DX5 to DR5 zoning district, and I'd be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (2:37:50 - 2:37:55)
We do have Alderman Hopkins here. Brian, would you like to comment on this item?

[Speaker 34] (2:37:57 - 2:38:55)
Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman. As council indicated, there was recently a childcare center in there that closed during the pandemic, despite their best efforts to keep it open, and despite other efforts to seek alternative commercial uses for the space, none was forthcoming. So the current conditions are an abandoned structure.

Previous proposals for this site included a 17-story tower, which was met with vehement neighborhood opposition due to the unique constraints of the parcel, which as council mentioned are somewhat small. So the neighborhood is in support of this initiative to keep it in its existing envelope, and the owner has indicated he intends to invest a substantial amount of his personal funds to bring the building up into full code compliance and to occupy it as a residence. So with that, it has my full support.

There's no opposition from the immediate neighborhood, and I would urge an aye vote.

[Speaker 1] (2:38:56 - 2:39:16)
Thank you, Brian. Any questions for the applicant or the alderman? Hearing none, Alderman, Vice-Chair Roboyas, moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed. All right, what about this one?

[Speaker 27] (2:39:16 - 2:39:17)
We're gonna take a motion to defer it.

[Speaker 1] (2:39:17 - 2:39:22)
All right, we're gonna finish this page, and then we're gonna go back to some other drama.

[Speaker 7] (2:39:22 - 2:39:23)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:39:23 - 2:40:02)
All right, bottom page 14, we'll ask for a deferral on this item, number 22134 in the 41st Ward. Ordinance was deferred on March 15th of 2023. The common address, 6945 West Farragut Avenue.

Change request from an RS2 residential single-unit detached house district to an RS3 residential single-unit detached house district. Alderman Beal makes a motion to defer this item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

This was done on behalf of Napolitano. Okay, any objections? Hearing none, the item will be deferred.

[Speaker 27] (2:40:03 - 2:40:04)
We're going to the bottom page 28.

[Speaker 1] (2:40:05 - 2:40:15)
All right, we're moving a little bit out of order. Who is this? Oh, okay.

This one?

[Speaker 27] (2:40:15 - 2:40:16)
Yep, and then we'll stop.

[Speaker 1] (2:40:17 - 2:40:42)
Okay, bottom of page 20, document number 22063 in the 27th Ward. Ordinance was deferred on January 18th of 2023. The common address is 330 West Chestnut Street.

The change request. Residential business plan development number 1551 to residential business plan development number 1551 as amended. Mariah Degrino is the attorney on this.

Mariah?

[Speaker 16] (2:40:42 - 2:41:05)
Thank you, Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Mariah Degrino with DLA Piper. My colleagues, Katie Jinkydale and Rich Clowder are also working on this matter with me.

The applicant is DK Chestnut LLC. As a preliminary matter, this application was considered and recommended for approval at the March 16th plan commission hearing. I would ask that the transcript from that hearing be incorporated into the record.

[Speaker 1] (2:41:07 - 2:41:17)
Alderman Mike Rodriguez moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, we'll proceed.

[Speaker 16] (2:41:18 - 2:42:31)
Thank you. The property is located at the northeast corner of Chestnut and Orleans and is currently vacant. The applicant requests an amendment to PD 1551, which was approved in October of 2022.

The PD approved development of a nine-story residential building containing approximately 128 dwelling units and 11 parking spaces. Purpose of the PD amendment is to increase the project FAR from 7.55 to 7.86 and to approve modifications to the building that emerged as more detailed plans for the project were developed. These changes include modifications to level one lobby and amenity areas to loading and back of house areas, modifications to MEP equipment areas, reducing the number of overhead garage doors and modifications to the balconies.

The overall FAR will be 7.86, which is achieved through an approximately $1.4 million contribution to the Neighborhoods Opportunity Fund. No changes to the approved ARO strategy are proposed. The approved strategy is to provide 20% onsite ARO units.

The project team has worked with Alderman Burnett and I understand he's here and can speak to his position on the project, but we would respectfully request the committee's recommendation of the proposed amendment.

[Speaker 1] (2:42:32 - 2:42:35)
Thank you, Mariah. Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 22] (2:42:36 - 2:43:08)
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. We did have a community meeting on this project in my ward with the local community organization, which in this case is the New North Unity Program. At that meeting, no one had any objections and the developer adhered to some of the changes that the community wanted.

So with that, Mr. Chairman, they supported, I supported, I asked for the committee's support. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:43:08 - 2:43:56)
So Alderman questions for the Alderman and the applicant. Hearing none, Vice-Chair, revoius moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, this item is passed as revised. All right, top page 21 in the ninth, infamous ninth, that is item number 21126. The ordinance was referred on September 21st of 2022 and the common address is 756 East 111th Street, sub area B of plan development number 1167 as amended and the change request, plan development number 1167 as amended to plan development number 1167 as amended again.

Mariah Degrino.

[Speaker 16] (2:43:56 - 2:44:25)
Thank you. The applicant in this one is Cup of Joe Coffee, LLC, which is doing business as veteran roasters. The purpose of the amendment is somewhat of a technical amendment.

It's to allow the use of the property for a coffee roastery and beer brewery that will be developed by veteran roasters. The application was considered and recommended for approval by the Chicago Plan Commission at a public hearing on March 16th. I would like to ask that the transcript from that hearing be incorporated into the record of today's proceedings.

[Speaker 1] (2:44:25 - 2:44:35)
Alderman Kappelman moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the records are incorporated.

Please proceed.

[Speaker 16] (2:44:36 - 2:46:10)
Thank you. The facility, the coffee roastery, beer brewery would also include a restaurant and an event space. It is approximately 16,500 square feet, two stories.

It would provide 54 parking spaces on site. No new curb cuts are proposed. This is within existing sub area B, which is planned for and has been developed with multiple phases of commercial oriented retail uses fronting on 111th Street.

So again, the technical nature of the change is to allow the coffee roastery and beer brewery, which is a type of food production use. The developer of veteran roasters is a mission-driven coffee roaster. They are committed to changing the lives of veterans.

They provide workforce development and job opportunities to at-risk veterans, helping them reintegrate into civilian life. Veteran roasters works with local housing and other service organizations as part of a broader continuum to help veterans thrive in civilian life. And the purpose again here for the Pullman facility would be to provide an opportunity for veterans to have job opportunities, workforce development in the production and back of house and front of house opportunities.

And then also provide kind of a physical beacon where veterans can gather and interact with each other for the community. Several stakeholders have submitted letters of support, which are part of the plan commission record, including Pullman Civic Organization, Civic Staffing, a Safe Haven, Greater Roseland Chamber of Commerce and Rosemore Community Association. And I know that Alderman Beal is here and can speak to the project as well, but would respectfully ask for this committee's recommendation of the amendment.

[Speaker 1] (2:46:10 - 2:46:13)
Thank you, Mariah. Alderman Beal.

[Speaker 23] (2:46:14 - 2:47:32)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. Actually, Mariah really knocked it out of the park with our presentation. This is a great project that is gonna cater to veterans.

To employ veterans with a coffee rose brewery and the addition of a restaurant that will employ nothing but veterans is really something special that the city should really be looking at as a model for the city of Chicago to, again, to provide those services for our veterans when they come back that have served our country and are just looking for stable work and housing. And also wanna note that Veterans Roast is also looking in the immediate area to build at least 60 units of affordable housing for veterans as well. So Veterans Roast is looking to house veterans, put them to work and giving them all the wraparound services they need to make sure that they come back and can function in a positive manner in our community.

So I'm really excited about this development. Mark Doyle is behind this push, who is a phenomenal supporter of veterans. And I look for your favorable support for this particular project.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:47:33 - 2:47:41)
Thank you, Alderman. Questions, comments? Oh, Chairman Villegas.

[Speaker 31] (2:47:42 - 2:48:23)
Not a question, Chairman, just a statement around this project. Very excited for my colleague from the Ninth Ward. Mr. Doyle has been a champion for veterans, wanting to make sure that providing job opportunities from his other endeavors with rags of honor and really just at the forefront at the federal level, pushing forward veteran issues. And so I'm very glad to see that this project's finally coming to fruition, creating jobs specifically for veterans. I'm glad to hear that there's even an opportunity to house veterans. So really, really glad to see that this project's moving forward and looking forward to supporting more projects in the Ninth Ward.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:48:24 - 2:48:40)
Thank you. Gil, other questions? Maybe it's for the Alderman.

Anthony, so we talked about the coffee, the roasting, whatever, but the narrative says there's a brewery.

[Speaker 23] (2:48:40 - 2:48:41)
Who's doing the brewery?

[Speaker 1] (2:48:42 - 2:48:43)
Is it the same company?

[Speaker 23] (2:48:43 - 2:48:44)
Same company's doing it all, yeah.

[Speaker 1] (2:48:44 - 2:48:46)
And a full service restaurant?

[Speaker 23] (2:48:46 - 2:48:59)
That is correct. With an outdoor, according to the plans, it's gonna be outdoor terrace as well, which is something that's very badly needed in the Ninth Ward, where somebody can actually have lunch outdoors. So we're really excited about it.

[Speaker 1] (2:48:59 - 2:49:31)
Fantastic, congratulations. Any other questions or comments? Hearing none, Alderman Capelman, moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, the item's passed as revised, correct? Okay.

All right. Now we're gonna take a motion to defer the next item on page 21, the request of Alderman Beal, that is document number 20752 in the Ninth Ward. Ordinance was referred on June 23rd of 21.

[Speaker 27] (2:49:32 - 2:49:32)
Yeah.

[Speaker 1] (2:49:33 - 2:51:13)
Common address is 13722 South Layton Avenue in the change request from the M11 Limited Manufacturing District to an M21 Light Industry District. All right, so Alderman Rodriguez makes a motion to defer this item. Again, on behalf of Alderman Beal, any comments, questions?

Hearing none, this item will be deferred. We're gonna take a motion to defer the next item in the Third Ward, again, at the request of Alderwoman Dowling. Yeah.

Okay, this item is number 22078, Third Ward. Ordinance was referred on January 18th of 2023. The common address is 4005 South Dearborn in the change request from an RT4 Residential Two-Plat Townhouse and Multi-Unit District to a C12 Neighborhood Commercial District.

Alderman Rodriguez makes a motion to defer this item on behalf of Alderwoman Dowling. Any questions, comments? Hearing none, this item, again, is gonna be deferred in the Third Ward.

Now, back to top of 15. Again, document number 22132, 27th Ward. Ordinance was referred on March 15th of 2023.

The common address is 1449 through 1453 North Sedgwick Street. The change request from B33 Community Shopping District to B25 Neighborhood Mixed Use District. Mike Esgar in the 27th Ward.

[Speaker 4] (2:51:14 - 2:52:12)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. Michael Esgar from the law firm of Acosta. I'm here on behalf of the applicant, Sedgwick Properties, LLC.

And with this property, which currently consists of two buildings, there's four units total. We worked with Alderman Burnett in the 27th Ward process to request an upzone to the B25 to allow for the construction of a five-story multifamily building with 27 units. And there will be, as a result of the upzone, five affordable units on site, all of the affordable on site.

It's also in a highly transit-served location, approximately 400 feet away from the Sedgwick CTA stop. And that was one of the reasons that the Old Town Merchants and Residents Association supported the density, as well as the project itself. And I have a letter of support from them.

And Alderman Burnett is here to speak on it. And I'm available for questions.

[Speaker 1] (2:52:13 - 2:52:13)
Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 22] (2:52:14 - 2:52:34)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Members of the committee. As the council has said, he did meet with the local community organization, which is the Old Town Merchants and Residents Association.

And we also had a community meeting. We didn't have any objections at that community meeting. So the community support this, so do I ask for the committee support.

[Speaker 1] (2:52:35 - 2:52:46)
Thank you. Questions, comments? Just a quick one, Walter.

So you have, what's on the property right now? Two, two flats or two?

[Speaker 4] (2:52:46 - 2:52:52)
Like two, two flats, two, two unit. They look like homes almost, but there's two units in each.

[Speaker 1] (2:52:52 - 2:53:10)
And the community was good with going that increase in density like that? Yeah. Good, okay.

My chief of staff likes that density argument here. So I just know how sometimes our Old Town neighbors are not so densely driven, I should say. So, yeah.

[Speaker 22] (2:53:10 - 2:53:14)
I really, a lot of density, but what's happening over there.

[Speaker 1] (2:53:14 - 2:54:00)
Okay. All right, any other questions, comments? Hearing none, Alderman Rodriguez makes a motion move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed. All right, middle of page 15, document number 21124, 27th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on September 21st of 2022. Common address, 1200 through 1234 West Randolph Street. Also 146 through 162 North Racine.

A change request, business plan development number 1458 to DX7, Downtown Mixed Use District. Then to residential business plan development number 1458 as amended. Michael Esger.

[Speaker 4] (2:54:01 - 2:54:41)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Again, Michael Esger from the law firm of Acosta Esger for the record. And this project was approved in 2019 as a hotel property.

And since that time, the hotel use was not able to get financed. And the owners of the property collaborated to do with the city winery to the east to create this new proposed project. As a preliminary matter, this was unanimously approved at the March 16th plan commission hearing.

And I'd like to respectfully request that the record of that proceeding be incorporated here today.

[Speaker 1] (2:54:41 - 2:54:50)
The vice chair, Robles moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the records are incorporated.

[Speaker 4] (2:54:50 - 2:57:13)
Thank you very much. The first slide that we're looking at talks about the community outreach. And again, in the 27th Ward, it's quite robust.

There's several different community stakeholders and community organizations. We met with everyone. There was a starting at, basically last spring and early summer, we went through a process of meeting with West Central Association, the neighbors of West Loop.

And we had a full community meeting on February 6th. The project was modified over time to reduce the scale and scope of the base, the podium of the building to have it be more in scale with the neighboring properties. We also added retail and activated the uses along Randolph Street further.

And that resulted in the building being reduced in height from 470 to 460 feet. It also reduced the number of units from 400 to 395, but still that generated with all 20% of the affordable units on site, which was the developer's commitment to Alderman Burnett, that's 79 affordable units in this area of Randolph Street for the West Loop, which was looked at very favorably. There's also commitment to WB and local hiring, in particular on the minority hiring, the team has committed to joint venture with a minority contractor.

And that was something that they also committed to with Alderman Burnett. If you go to the next slide, I'll just show you briefly the, you can see looking to the Northwest, you can see the tower itself and the building itself. And then the next slide, you'll see the base and sort of what happens at the street level and improvement to the pedestrian experience.

The site is currently a manufacturing and industrial dairy warehouse with semi trucks pulling in. So this is a great improvement to the traffic and pedestrian experience as well. Next slide.

If you can, Nicole, you might be far, again, a closeup of the pedestrian experience. I think that that's the entire slideshow. It is, and so with that, I'll be available for questions.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:57:14 - 2:57:17)
All right, Alderman Burnett on this item.

[Speaker 22] (2:57:18 - 2:58:08)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. As the counselor said, he did meet with several of the community organizations in this area. Then we had a community meeting.

There were no objections at the community meeting. I know one community organization supported it. Another community organization was asking for some other things.

So the majority of the people support it. People were very impressed with the outside dining area, how they widen the sidewalks and allow for more things to happen there. And also people were also impressed with all of the affordable housing that's going into the development.

So with that, we ask for the committee support. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:58:09 - 2:58:52)
Thank you, Alderman. Any questions for the Alderman or the applicant? Hearing none, Alderman Capelman moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, this item is passed as revised. All right, bottom of page 15, document number 22031 in the second ward, ordinance was referred on December 14th of 2022.

This common address is 1523 through 1547 North Fremont and the change request from the C35 Commercial Manufacturing and Employment District to B35 Community Shopping District and then to a residential business plan development. Mike Esger, again, in the second ward.

[Speaker 4] (2:58:53 - 2:59:27)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. Mike Esger on behalf of the applicant CityPads LLC. And this project, we approached Alderman Hopkins last year to start the process.

This lot is currently, you may know it on Weed in Fremont. It's a parking lot that's long been there and there's been proposals, but none of them have been able to come to fruition. This proposal went to the plan commission on March 16th and it was unanimously approved.

So I'd respectfully request the record of that proceeding be incorporated here today.

[Speaker 1] (2:59:27 - 2:59:39)
Alderman Rodriguez makes a motion to incorporate the records from the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the records are incorporated and please proceed.

[Speaker 4] (2:59:40 - 3:00:44)
Thank you very much. So the changes over time, working closely with DPD and also the community was to enhance the architectural definitions and the expressions on the facades. The most significant change you can see at the very bottom, which was the enclosure of a garage working with CDOT that was deemed to be the best solution for the parking.

There's only 29 parking spaces in this 132 unit five-story building. And that's because it is highly transit served. It's about 515 feet away from the Clyburn CTA stop, which certainly informed the project and the program and the development itself.

As a five-story building, the neighbors were very supportive and wanted to see development occur on that lot. And so we didn't receive any objections. And I know Alderman Hopkins is here to speak on it.

And so I'm available for any questions. Brian, would you like to speak on this please? Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 34] (3:00:45 - 3:01:17)
This was subject to a robust community review process primarily by the immediate residential towers who have some very active residents there. Their input was key. Their suggestions were incorporated and we are ready to move forward on this project.

It has onsite affordability. It has a transit orientation. As council mentioned, the design and aesthetics were improved as a result of community input.

So I'm proud to support this project and I would ask for an aye vote.

[Speaker 1] (3:01:18 - 3:02:12)
Thank you, Alderman. Questions for the Alderman or the applicant? Hearing none, Alderman David Moore makes a motion move, do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, this item is passed as revised. Thank you very much.

Bye, Michael. All right. Now, Mr. Moore, on top of page 16, document number 22147, oh wait, that was the one we did already. Okay, middle of page 16, document number 22120, 26th Ward. Ordinance was referred on March 15th of 2023. Common address on this one is 2432 West Erie Street and the change request from an RS3, residential single unit detached house district to an RM4.5 residential multi-unit district. Mr. Tom Moore.

[Speaker 8] (3:02:13 - 3:03:23)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name for the record is Tom Moore and this is a property in the 26th Ward owned by a family. There's an existing three flat with a quote unquote vacant lot next door.

The family would like to build a single family home on that lot for one of the two brothers to raise his family there. And so what needs to happen in that kind of situation is to bring the existing three flat, which is non-conforming into conformity and then the next door lot would become a buildable lot. So that is the request.

And if we were to change this, if you grant our motion to change this to an RM4.5, the lot next door will become buildable and the current three flat will become conforming. We did have several meetings with Alderman Maldonado and he is supportive and you do have a letter of support and we'd ask for your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (3:03:23 - 3:03:38)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Maldonado. So any questions for the applicant, the attorney? So we, my only question, existing three unit building and then they're gonna build another three unit?

[Speaker 8] (3:03:39 - 3:03:49)
No, a single family next door. So we're not doing anything with the lot next door. It'll stay in R3 and they'll do an as of right single family home there.

[Speaker 1] (3:03:49 - 3:04:27)
All right, other questions, comments? Hearing none, Alderman Caput makes a motion move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

None, hearing none, the item is passed. All right, bottom of page 16, document number 22112, 11th Ward. Ordinance was referred on March 15th of 2023.

Common address is 2924 through 2928 South Loomis Street. Change request from an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RT4 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district. Mr. Moore.

[Speaker 8] (3:04:27 - 3:04:53)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Tom Moore and this is for the Lamb family. They're a prominent importer in the Chinese neighborhood.

And they grew up in this building. It had a fire where a turtle, a pet turtle knocked over a heat lamp. And so the building has been unoccupied for some time.

[Speaker 1] (3:04:54 - 3:05:01)
And the family wants- That's the first unique reason that I've heard in the years I've been down here.

[Speaker 8] (3:05:02 - 3:05:34)
And so the family wants to move back in it with the siblings and their children and the parent, the Lamb parents. So it would, the three units would each have the parents and two of the siblings with their children. The cousins would grow up together as did the previous generation.

And we had a community meeting in the 11th ward with Alderman Lee and there was no objection to it. And we have a letter of support from Alderman Lee and we'd request your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (3:05:37 - 3:06:23)
We do have a letter of support from Alderwoman Lee. Any other questions or comments? Hearing none, Alderman Mike Rodriguez moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed. I'm not gonna say another word about the turtle.

All right, top of page 17. Let's see, document number 22121 in the fourth ward. Ordinance was referred on March 15th of 2023.

And the common address is 3305 through 3321 South Prairie. And the change request from an RM5 residential multi-unit district to an RS3 residential single unit detached house district. Mr. Moore.

[Speaker 8] (3:06:23 - 3:07:18)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name for the record is Thomas Moore. There was another case earlier that described this same problem.

Under the connected communities ordinance, you can no longer have a single family in a RM5 district. This is a piece of property where the gap community organization and the alderman and everybody has been working for years to build a bunch of single families there. And so to allow that to happen as has been planned for years this is a request to down zone from an RM5 to an RS3.

And we have a letter of support from Alderman Dahl and from the gap community organization and we would request your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (3:07:20 - 3:07:21)
Alderwoman King.

[Speaker 8] (3:07:22 - 3:07:22)
Yes, excuse me.

[Speaker 1] (3:07:24 - 3:08:01)
We do have a lot of support from Alderwoman King. Questions for the applicant? Hearing none, Alderman Mike Rodriguez makes a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, this item is passed. All right.

So now we're in the middle of page 17 and this is one of the ones we heard on the landmarking, right? Correct. Okay.

Okay, document number 2212. Excuse me, Mr. Yes, Mr. Moore.

[Speaker 8] (3:08:02 - 3:08:07)
Oh, so you're doing the other half, right? Yeah. I'm sorry, excuse me, thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:08:07 - 3:08:29)
Middle of page 17, document number 22122, fourth ward, ordinance was referred on March 15th of 2023. Common address on this one is 3300 to 3324 South Giles. Change request, RM5, residential multi-unit district to an RS3, residential single unit detached house district.

Again, Mr. Moore.

[Speaker 8] (3:08:29 - 3:09:12)
Yes, thank you. My name for the record is Thomas S. Moore and this really is the other half of the same project that was in the previous case.

It is a area that the GAP organization and the Alderman's office have long been working on a single family development and under the connected communities ordinance, you could no longer build the single families in an RM5. So this is a request to down zone from an RM5 to an RS3 to allow the single family development. And again, we have a letter of support from Alderman King.

[Speaker 1] (3:09:14 - 3:09:52)
We do, okay. We do have a letter of support from Alderman King. Questions for the applicant?

Hearing none, Vice Chair Roboius makes a motion move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Now, bottom page 17, document number 22111 in the 22nd ward. Ordinance was referred to March 15th of 2023. Common address is 2433 South Central Park Avenue and the change request from an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to B22 neighborhood mixed use district.

[Speaker 40] (3:09:54 - 3:09:55)
Mr. Pekarsky.

[Speaker 14] (3:10:02 - 3:11:23)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. I am Tom Pekarsky of the law firm of Gordon and Pekarsky. On behalf of the applicant, Jesus Ruiz, we're before you seeking an amendment to the city of Chicago zoning map form the current RT4 to that of a B22 for the property commonly known as 2433 South Central Park Avenue.

The subject site is a traditionally sized city lot measuring 25 by 125.25 feet is improved with a one story building. The property has traditionally been used as a neighborhood grocery store. Use was nonconforming under the existing RT4 zoning designation.

Unfortunately, the previous owner allowed the or did not maintain the license prior to their sale, which affected the legally nonconforming status of the use. The applicant would like to reestablish the use as a grocery store and is seeking an amendment to the B22 district to do so. We have reviewed our plans with Alderman Rodriguez and appeared before a virtual community meeting.

No objections have been voiced to the proposal and Alderman Rodriguez is present today to issue his opinion of the request. And therefore we would ask the committee to vote its recommendation of passage of the application to the full city council.

[Speaker 1] (3:11:25 - 3:11:27)
Thank you, Tom. Alderman Mike Rodriguez. Yes.

[Speaker 4] (3:11:29 - 3:11:50)
Chairman, I can attest since I grew up a block and a half from this location that we've frequented this location as a grocery store as children. And it's very consistent with what Mr. Pekarski said. No objections from neighbors or from my advisory council.

Thank you, Mr. Pekarski for the good job on this one. And thank you, Mr. Chair. I urge my colleagues to move this forward.

[Speaker 1] (3:11:52 - 3:12:09)
Thank you, Mike. Any questions for the Alderman or the applicant? Hearing none, Alderman Capelman moves to pass by the same roll call that was used for determined quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, this item is passed. Are we deferring?

[Speaker 27] (3:12:10 - 3:12:10)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (3:12:10 - 3:12:47)
All right, Tom, you're aware we're deferring the Emerald thing? Yes, Emerald definitely. Okay, so at the request of Alderman Lee, document number 22123 in the 11th ward, ordinance was referred to March 15th of 2023.

Common address is 3257 to 59 South Emerald. Again, the change is deferred per Alderman Lee. Can I get a motion to defer this item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

Alderman Capelman so does, so moves it. Any objections? Hearing none, this item will be deferred.

And then just skip the next one. We're skipping the next one?

[Speaker 14] (3:12:47 - 3:13:05)
If we could, I have the Alderman Lee support letter and there appears to be some, I think we'll have this resolved quickly.

[Speaker 1] (3:13:07 - 3:13:55)
Thank you. Okay, we're gonna skip that one and go to the bottom of page 18, document number 22129 in the 15th ward. Ordinance is deferred on March 15th of 2023.

This common address, 1938 to 1942 West 63rd Street. And the change request from an RS3, residential unit, detached house district to a C21 motor vehicle related commercial district, Manuel Cardenas, Mr. Cardenas.

[Speaker 40] (3:13:57 - 3:13:58)
All right, we'll put a hold on that one.

[Speaker 1] (3:14:03 - 3:14:27)
Top of page 19, document number 22114 in the 11th ward. Ordinance is deferred on March 15th of 2023. Common address is 3733 South Parnell Avenue.

And the change request from an RS3, residential single unit, detached house district to an RT4, residential two-plat townhouse and multi-unit district, Rich Tolf.

[Speaker 13] (3:14:27 - 3:15:10)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I was tempted to say I had two more pet turtle cases, but that's not the case. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My name is Rich Tolf. I'm an attorney at Georgeson-Sinowicki in Chicago. I'm appearing on behalf of the applicant, M.

Defogio Investments LLC, regarding application number 22114, as you said, seeking a zoning change from RS3 to RT4. The applicant purchased the property last year. Shortly afterwards, removed a dilapidated home.

We're proposing to replace that home. The applicant's principal, Mario Defogio, is a lifelong resident of the ward and operates a family plumbing business in the ward that's been in operation since 1887.

[Speaker 25] (3:15:10 - 3:15:11)
What kind of business?

[Speaker 13] (3:15:11 - 3:15:54)
What kind of business? Plumbing. Oh, sorry, plumbing.

They serve hundreds of buildings in Chicago and the surrounding area. The applicant proposes to build a three-dwelling unit home for the applicant's principal and his grown children, so the family will be living there. The applicant has, of course, presented the matter to elder person, Nicole Lee, and made a presentation at a meeting that the elder person hosted.

Based on that successful meeting, elder person Lee graciously provided a letter of support of the rezoning. I believe that letter of support was submitted to your committee. On behalf of the applicant, we do request your favorable recommendation for passage.

[Speaker 1] (3:15:56 - 3:16:44)
We do have a letter of support from elder woman Lee. Questions for the applicant? Hearing none, Vice Chair Arroyo's moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed. All right, middle of page 19, document number 22115 in the third ward.

Ordinance was referred on March 15th of 2023, common address 101 through 117 East 47th Street, also 4701 through 4705 South Michigan Avenue. The change request from B33 Community Shopping District and RM5 Residential Multi-Unit District all to a B33 Community Shopping District. Again, Rich Toth on this item.

[Speaker 13] (3:16:45 - 3:18:29)
Thank you, Chairman Toney. My name is Rich Toth. I'm an attorney at Georgeson-Sinowicki in Chicago.

I'm appearing on behalf of the applicant, East Lake Management and Development Corporation on this matter, which seeks a zoning change from a split zoning district of B33 and RM5 to a uniform B3-3 district. The applicant has owned the property since 1889. It also operates the property.

The property is an existing two-story mixed-use building with commercial spaces on the ground floor and dwelling units on the upper floor. Although we understand the existing building and commercial uses to have been located on the site for many decades, for some reason, the southern portion of the building is zoned RM5, although there have been many licensed businesses at the property for many years, upon newly realizing that this was a split zoning district situation, the city found itself unable to issue any new business licenses for the property based on the split zoning, the partial residential zoning.

This rezoning will resolve the split zoning district issue and will therefore allow new business licenses to be issued in conformance with the building's long history. The applicant also owns a separate residential building directly to the south, so there's no issue with somehow impacting an adjacent property owner. The applicant has, of course, presented the matter to Alderperson Pat Dowell, who's knowledgeable about the issues, and we believe Brian from her office will speak in support of this matter.

On behalf of the applicant, we do request your favorable recommendation for passage.

[Speaker 1] (3:18:32 - 3:18:34)
Brian from Alderwoman Dowell's office, please.

[Speaker 21] (3:18:35 - 3:18:39)
Brian Freedman, Third Ward Alderman Pat Dowell's office. We support the project.

[Speaker 1] (3:18:41 - 3:18:47)
So this, correct me if I'm wrong, this long-established ownership.

[Speaker 21] (3:18:47 - 3:18:48)
1886, yeah.

[Speaker 1] (3:18:48 - 3:18:55)
Business has been thriving 100 years, and we're now seeming we have a problem with the split zoning?

[Speaker 21] (3:18:56 - 3:19:13)
I think that maybe the zoning administrator might be able to give you the history about why this has been neglected over time, but yes, businesses have been thriving on that corridor, and we would support the city's ability to issue more business licenses to existing properties.

[Speaker 25] (3:19:14 - 3:19:41)
Patrick, do you have any comment on that? Slightly, yes, Chairman. Patrick Murphy, Department of Planning.

So the split zoning has existed, as Rich testified for a number of years. I don't know why business licenses were issued by BACP, but once we were aware of the issue with the split, we had to seek its correction, even if licenses were erroneously issued in the past for various businesses there.

[Speaker 1] (3:19:42 - 3:19:48)
So not to embarrass anybody, but I will. How long has it been an R5?

[Speaker 25] (3:19:49 - 3:19:55)
I don't recall. I know we looked up some of the history. I don't recall off the top of my head.

I can, I'll go back and figure it out again.

[Speaker 28] (3:19:55 - 3:19:58)
I don't remember. A number of years. We're gonna correct it.

We're gonna correct that, okay.

[Speaker 13] (3:19:58 - 3:20:03)
We're just tidying it up and we've got no objection to it. And then we wanna make it right.

[Speaker 1] (3:20:04 - 3:20:24)
Okay, well, I'm happy to be able to set it straight for the next 100 years. Any other questions or comments? If not, Vice Chair, Roboius moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

[Speaker 13] (3:20:24 - 3:20:26)
All right. All thanks to the committee. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (3:20:27 - 3:21:05)
Now, Mr. Bukarski, we have now heard from Alderwoman Lee. Chief Alderman. Chief Alderman.

So let me read it back into the record. This is Archer. Yes.

Document number 22146T1 in the 11th Ward. Ordinance was referred on March 15th of 2023. Common address is 2964 through 2968 South Archer.

And the change request from B11 Neighborhood Shopping District to B23 Neighborhood Mixed-Use District. Mr. Bukarski, Tom.

[Speaker 14] (3:21:05 - 3:21:38)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. I am Tom Bukarski of the Law Firm of Gordon and Bukarski representing the applicant, Hugh Chin. Before I begin my case in chief, I'd like to state that this is a type one zoning amendment.

The narrative in the application has been amended after submitting the application. But prior to today's hearing, the amended application has been submitted to the department and committee as a substitute. I ask that the substitute narrative and plans be accepted by the committee and be included in all decisions and findings on this matter.

[Speaker 1] (3:21:39 - 3:21:48)
This moves to accept the substantive narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the substitute is in front of us.

[Speaker 29] (3:21:49 - 3:21:49)
Please continue.

[Speaker 14] (3:21:50 - 3:22:49)
And before you this afternoon seeking an amendment of the City of Chicago zoning map from the current B11 to that of a B23 for the property commonly known as 2964 through 68 South Archer Avenue. The subject site is composed of three legal lots. The lots are vacant.

The applicant proposes to construct one building on each of the lots. Each of the buildings will provide ground floor commercial space and three residential units above for a total of nine residential units for the project. We have reviewed our plans with Alderman Lee and appeared before an extensive community process.

No objections have been voiced to the proposal and Alderman Lee has submitted her support in the form of a letter to the chairman and follow up information this morning. Therefore, we ask the committee to vote its recommendation of passage of the application to full city council. And you'll provide that letter to us.

[Speaker 20] (3:22:49 - 3:22:50)
I can.

[Speaker 14] (3:22:50 - 3:22:50)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (3:22:51 - 3:23:13)
All right. So we do have the support of Alderman Lee. Any questions for Mr. Piekarski?

Hearing none, Alderman Capelman moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, this item is passed with the substantive narrative and plans.

[Speaker 14] (3:23:14 - 3:23:41)
Thank you. And Mr. Chairman, as others have voiced and other members of the committee and staff as well, thank you for your service. For anybody else who's outgoing and we won't be seeing at the committee anymore, thank you for your service.

I know when members of- It's our pleasure to serve. Member of the bar understand that the amount of work that's put into this by all members of the city. So thank you.

Thank you, Tom. All right.

[Speaker 1] (3:23:44 - 3:23:51)
Let me ask again, do we have a Manuel Cardenas here? He got tired.

[Speaker 27] (3:23:52 - 3:23:53)
No, she wasn't.

[Speaker 1] (3:23:53 - 3:24:26)
All right. So I'm gonna ask for a motion to defer this item since we have no attorney. That is item number 22129 in the 15th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on March 15th of 2023. Common address, 1938 through 1942 West 63rd Street. Alderman Capelman moves to defer this item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, this item is deferred. Okay, where are we at now?

What page?

[Speaker 27] (3:24:29 - 3:24:29)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (3:24:30 - 3:24:55)
And we're on the top of page 20. Document number 20810T1 in the 33rd Ward. Ordinance was referred on September 14th of 2021.

This common address is 2837 through 2843 West Belmont. Change request from B31 Community Shopping District to B23 Neighborhood Mixed Use District. Mark Kupiak on this item in 33.

[Speaker 30] (3:24:56 - 3:25:18)
Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. My name is Mark Kupiak. I represent the applicant in this matter.

I have with me today Stan Pluta seated next to me on behalf of the applicant. One procedural point before we start is this was filed as a type one and we did submit a substitute narrative and plans. And with your permission, we'd like to proceed on the substitute.

[Speaker 1] (3:25:19 - 3:25:34)
Vice Chair Roboius moves to accept the substantive narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the substantive narrative and plans are in front of us.

[Speaker 30] (3:25:34 - 3:26:11)
Thank you. As you can see from that introduction date, we've been working on this project a long, long time at at least two big community meetings, both with mailed notice to the neighbors at some distance from the property, asking to rezone from B3-1 to B2-3 to allow a mixed use building. We're gonna do commercial on the ground floor and we'll do residential units above and it would be 24 residential dwelling units.

As I said, we work with the Alderman, we work with staff, talk to the neighbors and I do believe the Alderman has submitted a letter of support and we would ask for your recommendation.

[Speaker 1] (3:26:11 - 3:26:26)
We do have a letter of support from Alderwoman Rodriguez Sanchez. Any questions, comments other than my own? What took so long?

[Speaker 40] (3:26:27 - 3:26:27)
Pardon?

[Speaker 1] (3:26:28 - 3:26:38)
What took so long? What would the community process, exhaustive? What was the complaints?

I mean, I'm very familiar with Belmont over here. Was it just the fifth floor that was a problem?

[Speaker 30] (3:26:38 - 3:26:56)
Well, actually the height of the building and actually the substitute that we submitted and the plans we submitted reduced the height of the building. So actually our proposed building will be no taller than the building next door. The original building was taller and that was really the only- What is the height of the building?

[Speaker 40] (3:27:05 - 3:27:08)
54 feet, nine inches. All right.

[Speaker 30] (3:27:09 - 3:27:26)
Yeah, and the delay was not just the project. There was some staffing problem. We went through several chiefs of staff for the Alderman so it was a little difficult with each new chief of staff had to bring themselves up to date so it took a little longer than usual.

[Speaker 1] (3:27:29 - 3:27:39)
And you're a representative from Wilmot Construction? All right. Well, good luck.

Hopefully it won't take you two years to build it. Thank you very much. All right, thank you.

[Speaker 30] (3:27:40 - 3:27:43)
And Chairman, by the way, personal comment. Thank you for your service.

[Speaker 1] (3:27:44 - 3:28:02)
Did we approve it? I got a motion to pass. Okay, so Alderman Capelman makes a motion to pass this by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, this item is passed with the substantive narrative and plans. All right.

[Speaker 30] (3:28:02 - 3:28:10)
Thank you. And just a personal comment. Thank you for your service.

You've done a great job. I'm getting tired of all this. I know, I know.

But I had to say it. Seriously, we're gonna miss you.

[Speaker 1] (3:28:10 - 3:28:42)
Yep. Well, I'll be on Belmont, okay? So I'll be on Belmont.

All right, let's see. Middle of page 20. Document number 20930-T1 in the 27th ward.

Ordinance was referred on January 26th of 2022. Common address 936 North Elston Avenue. Also 11, I'm sorry, 111 West Augusta Boulevard.

The change request from M33 Heavy Industry District to B22 Neighborhood Mixed Use District. All right, Ed Cuss. Oh, it's not Ed Cuss.

[Speaker 10] (3:28:42 - 3:28:43)
I'm not Ed Cuss.

[Speaker 1] (3:28:45 - 3:28:49)
Let me see how it changes like that. Like that Four Eyes commercial?

[Speaker 10] (3:28:49 - 3:29:29)
They're coming out with great medications these days, but I'm not Ed Cuss. Thank you, you are. My name is Brayden Lord, and I work with Ted Cuss at the law firm of Taft, Stettinius, and Hollister.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. I am here representing, and with the applicant in this matter, American Property Holdings, LLC, specifically joined by Mr. Mario Short, managing member of the applicant. And before I give a brief overview, there are a few quick housekeeping matters.

First, this matter was heard before and approved by the Plan Commission on March 16th. So I'd like to request that the transcript of the 316 Plan Commission hearing be incorporated into the record of these proceedings.

[Speaker 1] (3:29:30 - 3:29:39)
So Vice Chair Roboys moves to incorporate the records of the Plan Commission by the same roll call used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the records are in front of us.

Please proceed.

[Speaker 10] (3:29:40 - 3:29:58)
The second housekeeping matter is with regards to how this item appears on the agenda. There's a Scrivener's error with regards to the address. The second house number associated with the subject property is 1111 West Augusta, rather than 111.

This seems to have only affected the agenda.

[Speaker 1] (3:29:59 - 3:30:03)
Is that okay? We don't need a substitute?

[Speaker 25] (3:30:03 - 3:30:11)
It provided the notice, and the boundaries was correct, and we can proceed with the change for the common address.

[Speaker 10] (3:30:11 - 3:30:36)
All right, let's go and we'll see if we need to. Okay, then the second is that since this matter was introduced, the applicant has become the property owner. They were originally the contract purchaser.

So I know the agenda lists a previous owner as the owner of the property. The owner is who? Is now American Property Holdings LLC.

That's now the applicant and the property owner, rather than Allen Katz.

[Speaker 1] (3:30:39 - 3:30:45)
Okay, now with both of those changes, I don't think the ownership is an issue, is it?

[Speaker 25] (3:30:48 - 3:30:54)
Filed regardless, and this is not uncommon for ownership to change as legislation makes its way through the process.

[Speaker 1] (3:30:55 - 3:30:57)
And on the address?

[Speaker 27] (3:31:01 - 3:31:06)
The ordinance is correct, we do not need a substitute. The boundary is correct?

[Speaker 40] (3:31:09 - 3:31:11)
Yeah, correct, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (3:31:15 - 3:31:36)
All right, and I don't know, Walter, I don't know if you were here in the public comment period. We had, I don't think he was available when we asked, because this was a call in from American Property Holdings.

[Speaker 10] (3:31:36 - 3:31:45)
Oh, I think there was just mistakenly the applicant submitting one of those forms as a- Well, he didn't have anything to comment other than he didn't, he wasn't here, right?

[Speaker 1] (3:31:45 - 3:31:56)
No, okay. So it was incorrect on the application, but we don't need any additional- So it was incorrect on the application, but we do not need to get a substitute. Scrivener's error.

[Speaker 10] (3:31:57 - 3:34:33)
Okay, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'll give a brief overview.

The applicant is requesting a type one zoning map amendment to rezone the subject property from the M33 Heavy Industry District to the B22 Neighborhood Mixed Use District. And this is to allow the rehabilitation, renovation, and construction of a third floor addition to the existing two-story building at the subject property, and then to use that existing and renovated building as a single family home. The subject property is located within the North Branch Industrial Corridor, and that's why it's rezoning required review and approval before the plan commission.

As indicated in the subject property's application packet and ordinance, the subject property is a strange L-shaped site. It contains approximately 4,934 square feet of site area and consists of an Eastern leg that fronts on Elston Avenue, and that is where the existing building is located, and then a Northern leg that fronts on Augusta Boulevard and is improved with a driveway and a two-car garage. As I mentioned, the applicant proposes to renovate and construct a second and third floor addition to that existing building in order to use the building as a single family home.

It's currently been a longstanding vacant property that historically had residential use, but most previously before this was used as a warehouse. As a result of the proposed renovation and addition, the building will be approximately 34 feet, six inches tall and contain approximately 4,954 square feet of floor area. The requested zoning change will allow residential use of the subject property in a manner that's generally consistent with the zoning and land uses to the North, South and West of the site, and will allow for the preservation of a building that architecturally contributes to the industrial heritage of the surrounding area, but thus far, but has been vacant for quite some time.

The development team engaged in various forms of outreach in connection with this proposal, including a meeting with Alderman Burnett's staff, and then at their recommendation, a meeting with the Neighbors of River West, which has since issued a letter of support. I will defer to the Alderman regarding his support today. Otherwise, we are very grateful for your time.

Respectfully request your favorable consideration of this matter and are available for any questions you may have.

[Speaker 1] (3:34:33 - 3:34:35)
Thank you. Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 22] (3:34:36 - 3:34:49)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So they met with the local community organization of Neighbors of River West. They had a community meeting.

I don't see a problem with it. They didn't have any problems we asked for the community support.

[Speaker 1] (3:34:49 - 3:35:02)
All right, questions for the applicant or the Alderman? Hearing none, Alderman David, more moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, this item is passed as revised.

[Speaker 40] (3:35:03 - 3:35:03)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (3:35:04 - 3:35:05)
All right, our last item.

[Speaker 40] (3:35:05 - 3:35:07)
Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (3:35:12 - 3:35:18)
I'm sorry, are you the happy homeowner? I am. Good luck to you.

[Speaker 27] (3:35:18 - 3:35:18)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:35:19 - 3:36:07)
All right, and on page 22, last item. We are on number 22023 in the third ward ordinance was referred on November 16th of 2022. The common address is 328 West 40th Place.

And the change request from plan manufacturing development number eight to plan development, what, as amended? Why is that? What is that?

Is it amended? Okay, so plan manufacturing development number eight just to a plan development. I'm not sure you'll explain that.

And we have, who's going to be speaking on this, Robert?

[Speaker 9] (3:36:08 - 3:36:08)
Nope.

[Speaker 1] (3:36:09 - 3:36:10)
Or not Robert.

[Speaker 9] (3:36:10 - 3:36:57)
I'm not Robert. I'm Betsy Gates-Alford from Burke, Warren, McKay and Saratella. I'm here representing the applicant, the Missner group regarding the property at 328 West 40th Place.

And specifically the request for a change from PMD 8A to plan development, as you mentioned. The reason for the change is that this is a proposed new industrial facility, larger than 10 acres. So under the recent amendments to the air quality ordinance that requires approval as a plan development.

We did appear before the plan commission regarding this plan development on March 16th, 2023. And we're pleased to receive their unanimous positive recommendation on the application. As a preliminary matter, I would ask to incorporate the record from the plan commission hearing into today's proceeding.

[Speaker 1] (3:36:59 - 3:37:09)
Alderman or vice-chair Roboius moves to incorporate the records to the plan commission by the same roll call that was used to determine form. Any objections? Hearing none, the records are in front of us.

Please proceed.

[Speaker 9] (3:37:10 - 3:40:35)
Thank you. And as I mentioned, this is a proposed new industrial development on a site that was historically used for industrial buildings. There were several vacant and dilapidated industrial buildings on the site, which are proposed to be demolished and replaced with a single new industrial facility.

It is 180,900 square feet in size. We did hold three community meetings both before and after the application was filed, received no objections. The one comment that came out of those meetings was to route any truck traffic away from the residents that live on the South side of Root Street, which is South of this project, which we have addressed in our plan get to on the next slide.

Alderman Dowell's office has worked closely with us in connection with those community meetings. And we were pleased to have her expression of support to the plan commission. I know Mr. Friedman from her office is here today as well. As I mentioned, this new industrial facility will be a 180,900 square foot new industrial building that represents an investment of over $27 million in the Fuller Park neighborhood and will replace the existing vacant and dilapidated improvements on the site with a new state-of-the-art facility. This will add jobs, both temporary construction jobs and new permanent jobs to the neighborhood. And the applicant is committed to meeting the city's minority and women business enterprise participation goals.

The site is an irregularly shaped property. It's located slightly West of the 9094 Expressway as shown on the aerial image above. The property does have a small amount of frontage on Root Street on the South and then on Princeton Avenue on the East and the West and North sides of the site are bounded by railroads.

On the next slide, please. The site has been designed to put the building back from the public street frontages and to have the green space and detention facing the neighborhood residents on the South side of Root Street and then also to provide buffering along the Princeton Avenue frontage with the building and the loading docks being oriented towards the railroad tracks. As I mentioned, one of the comments that came out of the community meeting related to truck traffic, ingress and egress from the site, all truck traffic would be routed coming Westbound to Princeton Avenue and then going North on Princeton to the entrance at the far Northeast corner of the site, which would be the only point of ingress for truck traffic.

There is an ingress and egress point on Root Street, but that would be limited to passenger vehicles only. That also the movement of truck traffic further West on Root Street would also be impossible due to the height of the railroad overpass. So there would be absolutely no traffic crossing in front of those residents on Root Street.

We will provide loading docks, 35 loading docks and 38 trailer spaces on the site, which would be oriented facing the railroad tracks to the West as well as 176 passenger vehicle parking spaces and 18 bike parking spaces. I'm joined today here by representatives of the applicant, Barry Missner and Cody Bailog and by Meric Pula from where Malcolm, who is the project architect. And we're happy to address any questions that the committee has.

[Speaker 1] (3:40:36 - 3:40:39)
We hear from Brian from the third ward, please.

[Speaker 21] (3:40:41 - 3:41:32)
Thank you very much, Chairman. Again, Brian Friedman, third ward Alderman Pat Dowell's office. Everything the attorney for the applicant said is true.

They went through an extensive community process, worked with the neighbors, worked with Alderman Dowell's office to present a really exciting and drastically changed building for the property. Really good use for kind of an outdated, underused, underutilized property adjacent to some intermodal so they can get the warehousing in. If you go just North of the property on Pershing, parking lot for the Sox Park, so they're not really gonna affect any residents there.

They did take into account some of the residents South on route, like they said. So Alderman Dowell was very happy to welcome this new thriving business to the ward.

[Speaker 1] (3:41:33 - 3:41:40)
Great, questions, comments? Yes, Alderman Villegas.

[Speaker 27] (3:41:40 - 3:41:46)
Is there already a potential renter for the facility?

[Speaker 25] (3:41:47 - 3:42:20)
Yes, would you identify yourself for the record? Barry Misner, the Misner Group. There aren't right now, but we have two other projects going on, one on Pershing and one in the Stockyards Industrial Park.

And what we've seen is once the projects are actually under construction, most of the potential tenants are looking for occupancy much closer on this project may not be able to break ground until next spring, which means it's another 10 to 12 months after next spring. So we don't have any prospects right now, but we couldn't promise occupancy until probably the end of 24 or late into 24.

[Speaker 1] (3:42:20 - 3:42:31)
Got you, okay, thank you. All right, it'd be interesting to have the current site. Do you have the current, what it looks like now?

Because obviously it's a big improvement. I'd like to see what it is now.

[Speaker 9] (3:42:32 - 3:42:34)
If you go back one, I'm sorry, two slides. Yes.

[Speaker 25] (3:42:34 - 3:42:35)
That's the current site.

[Speaker 9] (3:42:35 - 3:42:35)
Yes, thanks.

[Speaker 25] (3:42:36 - 3:42:44)
I know what it looks like. Kind of the. It's actually the buildings have been torn down.

These are the old plating manufacturing buildings were torn down by the current owner.

[Speaker 1] (3:42:45 - 3:43:07)
Okey-doke. All right, okay. Any other questions, comments?

Otherwise Alderman Kappelman, moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed as revised.

All right, we have one more deferral and we're gonna complete this, I think. Which one? The middle one?

[Speaker 40] (3:43:08 - 3:43:08)
Yep.

[Speaker 1] (3:43:09 - 3:43:14)
Okey-doke. This one.

[Speaker 27] (3:43:15 - 3:43:16)
The Sarah one, yes.

[Speaker 1] (3:43:16 - 3:44:30)
Oh, I just looked at Wrigley and I'm like, what the heck is that? Okay, this is on page 10. Number 22136, 32nd Ward.

Ordinance was referred on March 15th of 2023. Common address is 1354 West Diversity Parkway. The change request from B3-2 Community Shopping District to B2-2 Neighborhood Mixed Use District.

Alderman Kappelman on behalf of Alderman Wagesman would like this to be deferred. So Alderman Kappelman makes a motion to defer this item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, this item will be deferred and that concludes our agenda. I wanna thank my staff, local, downtown department. It's been great working with you guys.

Yep. All right. Oh no, no.

I told you not to do any of this shit. What do I got? Alderman Kappelman makes a motion definitely to adjourn and turn that screen off too, so.

All right. Hearing no objection, this meeting will be deferred. We'll see you all tomorrow.

Okay.
