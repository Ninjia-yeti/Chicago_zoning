[Speaker 5] (2:29 - 2:31)
Happy snow day, dear colleagues.

[Speaker 4] (2:37 - 2:46)
Hey Ray. Hopefully this is the last year for this year.

[Speaker 5] (2:51 - 2:53)
Is it coming down pretty good by you?

[Speaker 4] (2:54 - 3:00)
Yeah, you know, but not. It's real light it's dissipate soon as it hits ground.

[Speaker 3] (3:01 - 4:04)
Hi colleagues. Good afternoon. Good afternoon.

The March 15. The March 15 2021 committee on zoning landmarks and building standards is called to order. Pursuant to applicable law that has determined that an in person meeting is not practical or prudent.

Accordingly attendance at the meeting will be held by remote means only. We'll start off with the roll call, and your name is called please unmute yourself. We'll start with Vice Chair.

Ariel. Okay. Alderman Dow.

Here. Alderman Hopkins. Present.

Alderman Sawyer. Sorry. Alderman Beal.

Right here Mr. Chairman. Thank you. Alderman Ray Lopez.

[Speaker 5] (4:06 - 4:07)
The original is present.

[Speaker 3] (4:09 - 4:33)
Alderman David Moore. Alderman Mike Rodriguez. Present.

Alderman Ciccio Lopez. Present. Alderman Burnett.

Alderman Cardona. Present Chairman. Alderman Wagesveld.

[Speaker 19] (4:33 - 4:34)
Here.

[Speaker 3] (4:35 - 4:40)
Alderman Kerry Austin. Here. Alderman Villegas.

[Speaker 19] (4:41 - 4:41)
Here.

[Speaker 3] (4:42 - 4:43)
Alderman Riley.

[Speaker 19] (4:44 - 4:44)
Here.

[Speaker 3] (4:44 - 4:46)
Alderman Kappelman.

[Speaker 19] (4:46 - 4:47)
Here.

[Speaker 3] (4:47 - 6:25)
Alderman Osterman. Present. Alderman Hatton.

I obviously I'm here. Okay, so we have 14 members present and we do have a quorum. There are no speakers that have signed up for the public comment period, but we did get a couple of correspondences one was sent to the committee members with the packet.

That was from the environment, Illinois Environmental Council. And just within the last half hour. I believe.

Well that was in the negative. And then two other emails, one from Chicago lawyers committee to civil rights opposition air quality ordinance. And the other is from organization called stream.

And they are not in support. But there are no members that will be speaking, since none signed up. So now we'll move directly to the ordinance.

And that will be document number 02020 dash 4590, a text amendment of municipal code title 17 regarding requirements associated with manufacturing in manufacturing districts. It is my understanding. Thank God we have a substitute on this matter.

I'm going to ask. Can I get a motion to accept the substitute.

[Speaker 5] (6:27 - 6:29)
Chairman Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 3] (6:29 - 7:17)
Ray Lopez moves to David Morris present. Thank you, David, we'll have you down. All the Burnett present also.

Anybody else. Okay, so Alderman Ray Lopez moves to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections.

Hearing none, the substitute is accepted and before us. And we will start with Angela Tovar, the city's chief sustainability officer here to testify on the matter. And then he and she will be followed by Patrick Murphy from planning department.

All right. Oh, I'm sorry. Alderman Beal, your hand is up.

[Speaker 10] (7:18 - 8:13)
Yes, Mr. Chairman. You know, first, I would like to start by commending Alderman Garza and Alderman Thompson for getting us to this point. But after really going through the ordinance, along with my Calumet Industrial Commission, who this would have a huge, huge impact on.

I was just wondering if I can offer up a friendly amendment to the substitute that is being proposed on the air quality piece to give the alderman the authority to have final say on the air quality or portion of the ordinance. As of right now, the commissioner or whoever the commissioner is would have final say. So on a air quality test or, you know, whatever the standard is, it will be in the hands of the commissioners.

[Speaker 3] (8:14 - 9:05)
I'm happy to entertain that. But I think for the benefit of the committee members, I'd like to make the presentation, both from the department and from the mayor's office. And then we can entertain.

We have the sponsors already, too. So my goal was to get the presentation from the mayor's office and from the department and then talk to our sponsors on that, Mike Rodriguez, Susan Garza, and also George Cardenas. And then we're going to open up for some Q&A.

And I think we'll be happy to entertain that idea at that point. All right. Thank you.

Thank you. All right. With that said, Angela, are you on the call, ready to go?

[Speaker 11] (9:07 - 9:08)
Yes, chair. Can you hear me?

[Speaker 3] (9:09 - 9:12)
We can. We're ready to go.

[Speaker 11] (9:12 - 12:44)
Okay, great. Thank you, Chairman Tunney and esteemed members of this committee. We are here today to discuss ordinance 02020-490, which is an amendment of municipal code title 17 regarding requirements associated with manufacturing and planned manufacturing district.

Next slide, please. I'd like to start today by providing some context. In 2020, the city of Chicago released its first ever air quality and health report, which analyzed which neighborhoods must be prioritized for efforts to mitigate and reduce air pollution.

Air pollution, to be clear, is harmful to Chicago's residents' health and quality of life. Exposure to pollutants such as ozone and PM 2.5 is associated with increased risk of lung irritation, respiratory problems, cardiovascular disease, asthma, cancer, and early death. The report acknowledges that while all communities within the city of Chicago suffer from poor air quality, underlying socioeconomic factors like race, income, and health variables also play a role in who is most vulnerable to air pollution.

The city's Department of Public Health epidemiologists measured this vulnerability, combining the pollution risks and overall health risks in each area. The data that was used as the source and the methodology to formulate this map are commonly used. This is a scientific methodology that is also used by the US EPA, the state of California, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and here in Illinois, a similar methodology is used to identify environmental justice communities for Illinois Solar for All.

Next slide, please. I will share with you a similar map that again shows the areas of highest air quality vulnerability. This time, this map is overlaid with the locations of our PMDs and manufacturing districts.

You will see that there is a prevalence of industry in our highest scoring area, which are commonly our low-income communities and communities of color on the south, southeast, and southwest sides. The air quality health report revealed pollutants such as diesel particulate matter are more prevalent in areas with significant traffic and industry. Next slide, please.

Our work must continue beyond this one organ to bring systematic regulatory reform aimed at mitigating air pollution and protecting our communities, particularly those that are located near heavy industry. The broader air quality reform agenda, which was announced by Mayor Lightfoot in July 2020, will continue to move forward and will include the revision of existing rules for demolition, rock crushing, and other recycling facilities, new laws and regulations to evaluate the cumulative impact of polluting industries, and the strengthening of permitting requirements over businesses who emit air pollution and reforms to the city's inspection process. I will turn it over to Patrick Murphy, our zoning administrator, who will provide additional details on the specifics of this ordinance.

And we are also joined by our colleagues from the Department of Transportation, the Department of Health, and the Department of Planning and Development, who will share additional information and be available to answer any questions. Thank you.

[Speaker 3] (12:45 - 12:53)
Thank you, Angela. As Angela said, Patrick Murphy, you ready?

[Speaker 1] (12:53 - 17:52)
Yes, sir. Yes, Chairman. Hi.

Good afternoon. Thank you, sir. Good afternoon, everyone.

First, I'd like to back up just a little bit and go through some of the details about the ordinance itself, and then get into some of the reasons for the substitute, as well as highlighting some of the proposal to propose changes that we have. As you can see on the screen, the chart that we'll go through will highlight the impacted industrial land uses, and we'll walk through what the proposed changes are that are containing this ordinance. So, first of all, the proposed changes will include the elimination of certain manufacturing-based land uses, the adjustment of use standards associated with certain manufacturing-based land uses which are remaining, and modifications to retail activities allowed in manufacturing and planned manufacturing zoning districts.

As the Chairman said, there is a substitute today, and the substitute specifically discusses oversight for warehousing, wholesaling, and freight movement uses in commercial and planned manufacturing zoning districts as it relates to planned development designations, the introduction of site plan review criteria for the various industrial uses shown on the far left-hand column of the screen, the increasing in notice requirements related to special uses, and addresses retail activity in manufacturing and planned manufacturing districts for which the general public is not allowed on the premises. So, in regards to the specific zoning details, as reflected in the proposed substitute ordinance amendment, they are designed to focus on the following.

One, as you see on the bottom of the chart, the elimination of mining, excavation, public and private incinerators, sanitary landfills, and daycare uses from various manufacturing and planned manufacturing districts. Proposals for all windrow composting, intensive manufacturing, production, and industrial services, the most intensive recycling classifications, warehousing, wholesaling, freight movement uses, container storage, freight terminals, the outdoor storage of raw material as a principal use, and all remaining waste-related uses, would require a mandatory planned development being automatically triggered if any sites exceed 10 acres.

That's identified on the bullet points on the right, and we're talking about the eight uses on the left-hand column. And then furthermore, for all of those above uses, except for warehousing, wholesaling, and freight movement, an additional planned development trigger is proposed when any such use is located within 660 feet, so one city block, of a residential, business, commercial, or parks and open space district. Additionally, all of those above industrial uses, including the warehousing, wholesaling, and freight movement, would be subject to site plan review standards related to landscaping and lighting, along with a mandated public comment and meeting opportunity regarding not only the environmental and traffic analysis done by the City's Departments of Transportation and Public Health, but the entire project or proposal.

These steps equate to the establishment of new city authorities over by-right projects to the same degree that oversight is available for projects subject to special use or planned development review. Finally, as it relates to all the aforementioned industrial uses, they will all be subject to the Sustainable Development Policy of the City's Department of Planning and Development. Conversely, if a Type 1 Zoning Map Amendment is proposed for certain sensitive uses, such as residential, daycare, hospital, parks and open space, schools, restaurant with an outdoor patio, or other outdoor assembly uses, and this is highlighted in the bullet points on the bottom of the screen, which are proposed to be within 660 feet of the previously listed industrial uses, then such sensitive uses are subject to special use review and approval unless they otherwise trigger a planned development. Now, regarding the special use notification requirements, applicants for all special uses will now be required to send notification to the Aldermanic Office of the ward in which the project is proposed to be located. This language mirrors regulations which already exist related to notification for administrative adjustments.

And then finally, regarding retail activities in manufacturing and planned manufacturing districts, warehouses may include the distribution of retail products, both general and food and beverage, to the consumer, provided there is no customer accessible sales area on site. Such products do not have to be produced on site. And thank you again, Chairman and members of the committee.

I'm happy to answer any questions and dive into more of these details, and I'll turn it over to the Department of Transportation to talk about their aspects of the proposal.

[Speaker 9] (17:58 - 22:31)
Good afternoon. This is Big Krishna Murthy, Deputy Commissioner for CDOT. I'd just like to give a review of the CDOT traffic study process and the scope and process that that entails.

This is built off the existing traffic study standards that CDOT uses for existing planned developments and special uses. The scope of those studies includes trip generation and traffic distribution. So we work with the applicant and their traffic study consultant to review projections for generation of how many vehicles, what type of vehicles, what time of day those vehicles would be coming to and from a site.

And then also what assignment of streets, intersections, highway on ramps and routes through neighborhoods or through communities that would be used in order to get a baseline understanding of what is the traffic impact for a proposed use. Also, we request site plan information so that we can review the location of driveways, floating docks, pedestrian entrances, and other multimodal facilities that may be impacted from a transportation perspective, such as bike lanes, bus lanes, bus stops, bike parking. These are all evaluated through a few key performance indicators or KPIs, both operationally as well as in terms of physical geometry.

So those include intersection and signal operations. For example, looking at what is the impact of added traffic on a street traffic light, for example, requirement, for example, of left turn or right turn arrows to accommodate proposed traffic volumes. Queue lengths, particularly looking at impacts on nearby intersections, driveways to understand how at peak times intersections and streets may perform based on proposed traffic generation from a development.

Geometry of streets, particularly with an attention to large vehicles and their turning movements to understand how this can or cannot be accommodated based on the existing geometry of streets and alignment of curbs and lanes. And then multimodal access, both bicycle, pedestrian and transit access to a site, particularly for job access, not so much on the freight side, but workers and people getting to and from. And then truck routing.

And we understand that this is one of sort of the aspects that this entire ordinance package is trying to address the issue of trucks in our city. And so we do work to understand what are proposed plans for how vehicles will make it from the interstate network, arterial street network, ultimately to access a driveway and loading dock and what that entire journey looks like. We then work cooperatively with a lot of back and forth with the applicant to understand that all of these projections and assumptions are really evidence based and consistent with our experience and understanding of how uses like this perform and the true traffic generation associated with various uses like this in the city of Chicago.

And then these information will be used as inputs to the air quality review that CDPH will ultimately be responsible for overseeing. But the vehicle generation, number of vehicles and type of vehicles is a key input that can be used to model air quality impacts, which is a new process that kind of doesn't exist today as part of the PD. Then mitigations that we typically consider include infrastructure mitigations like new or modified traffic control devices, such as developer required traffic signals, modification to existing traffic signals, addition of stop sign or other traffic control signs, as well as multimodal roadway improvements, such as the addition of new vehicular lanes, new bicycle lanes, or other facilities that can help manage traffic impacts.

Then operational mitigations include working with proposed developments on their traffic management strategies, including managing the number of vehicles coming and going at a given time, off hour movements of vehicles when that is applicable, as well as other management plans like routing for trucks as well as turn restrictions for vehicles to make sure that traffic generated is being most appropriately directed onto the street network. I'd like to pass it on to the Department of Public Health so they can provide more information on the air quality study. Thank you.

[Speaker 3] (22:31 - 22:55)
All right, before we get to the Department of Health though, I see Alderman Haddon has her hand up and Alderman La Spada, and then just for the record, Vice Chair Roboius is in attendance. All right. Thanks, Chairman.

[Speaker 7] (22:55 - 23:02)
Just wanted to be noted for the roll call as present, and I'll reserve my questions on the matter until the presentations are over. Thank you.

[Speaker 3] (23:03 - 23:04)
Thank you. Alderman La Spada.

[Speaker 12] (23:06 - 23:09)
Also reserving questions till the end. Thank you.

[Speaker 3] (23:09 - 23:30)
Okay. Alrighty. Is there anyone else that we missed in the roll call?

All right. So let's move on to the Department of Health. We lost the connection on that.

[Speaker 2] (23:38 - 23:40)
I apologize. Can you hear me now?

[Speaker 3] (23:41 - 23:44)
Yes. Identify yourself for the record, please.

[Speaker 2] (23:44 - 31:30)
My name is Dave Graham, Assistant Commissioner for Environmental Permitting and Inspections at Public Health. So I'm here today to talk about the concern with regards to zoning and health. Based on the number of industrial sites throughout the city, what we would like to do is ensure that through this ordinance that we can review individual sites that could be non-industrial that are close by to new development and try to develop potential mitigation strategies to further improve public health.

Next slide, please. For example, we have numerous facilities throughout the city that handle waste or construction and demolition debris. Many of these operations include places where we take our trash or it gets sent off to somewhere else, liquid waste facilities that may collect unused material that can be reprocessed for reuse or can be used as a fuel source.

We also have many places where construction and demolition material, rock crushers, can be taken to be recycled for reuse when they can't be done on site. Many of the issues that we deal with are either due to truck traffic or because of the operations that they have where it's pretty intensive where they can crush material, which creates dust and track out and those type of things. Some of the issues that we can do to mitigate that is to have appropriate sweeping activities along the adjacent streets, also on internal roads.

Midterm, we can work with a company to make sure that they have appropriate screening. It could be walls, it could be higher fences with meshing, something along that nature to ensure we don't have dust going off and leaving the site. That's a big concern when we're talking about silica that is contained in the concrete.

For a long-term solution, some operations, depending on their location, may be ideal to be fully enclosed so this way it can be managed more effectively. Next slide, please. Recycling facilities.

There are a number of different types of recycling facilities throughout the city. There are companies that they collect metals, they may collect glass, they collect composting material, paper. All those things have the ability to either blow off the site or migrate off the site.

Some of the facilities like Winrow and other composting have an opportunity to have odors going off into the neighborhood. All of these facilities have the potential for increased truck traffic. That's how the material gets to these sites.

You need to get it there somehow and it's usually through trucks. Some of the short-term mitigation activities, depending on the nature of the site, could be growing different types of trees that would provide a screen for dust that would leave the site. Mid-term, storage piles could be better screened.

Things could be done on-site where three-sided bins or three-sided bins with covers or some type of facility that would enclose such material that's a concern. For a longer term, we could also talk about enclosure or processing equipment and loading areas to reduce odors from migrating. A specific example is depending on the type of composting you might use, composting could be done in-vessel or it could be done in a building that would have some type of odor controls.

Part of the intent of the ordinance is that we would use an existing process that developers go through. Whenever a new facility comes into play, CDOT requires specific traffic studies. These traffic studies are a method for us to find out what type of equipment and what type of vehicles and how many vehicles are going to be there.

The intent is to take a look and use the traffic study to determine what impact that could have, including with what are some of the proposed activities on those sites at the proposed site. All of the truck traffic information is used to develop what type of air pollutants, greenhouse gases, air toxics that are determined from the traffic study. It goes into an established model using US EPA's Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator MOVES and AIRMOD, which is pretty much the standard that everybody uses as far as modeling air emissions.

This would be the first time applicants would be required to provide estimates of air quality for impact before it goes for a site plan approval. Generally speaking, this process is already required by federal regulations for large projects with traffic impacts. Next slide, please.

Next slide, please. We skipped one. There we go.

The recommendations that we would look at is once, based on the traffic study and then the inputs that go into US EPA's MOVES, that information could be compared to health standards. It also would then fall into the Illinois State Implementation Plan, which sets the cumulative amount of pollution that is allowed in an area. If required, additional evaluation through well-established rules could be taken a look to see what's the true impact for a community with a new facility coming on site.

Some of the things that could be done is recommending that there's reduced truck capacity to eliminate impacts, bolstering up the type of landscaping that's at the site to increase carbon capture. An important part of this would be asking folks who drive trucks and come to a site to have an anti-idling plan. Often, folks are waiting in a truck because of the weather.

There are facilities that already have places where the truck drivers can get out, wait their turn, and not have to have their truck idling as we're going along. The recommendations would be enforceable as conditions of the site plan review and the zoning approval. Again, developers and consultants who prepare traffic studies are familiar with these federal regulations already.

I'll turn it back over to my colleagues.

[Speaker 3] (31:36 - 31:37)
Patrick, who else is presenting?

[Speaker 1] (31:39 - 32:00)
I can wrap up the conversation here, Chairman. What I can also do then is we're here to answer questions for any of the aldermen about either the specifics of the ordinance or potential processes that may be involved in any of the reviews. There's no other staff information to add at this time, but we can answer any questions that there might be of the committee.

[Speaker 3] (32:02 - 32:33)
CDOT and Department of Health and yourself will be here for questions because there will be questions, I know. With that being said, I'm going to ask some limited time for the sponsors of the ordinance to say a few words. The original sponsors were George Cardenas and Susan Sedlowski-Garza and Mike Rodriguez.

Susan, I'll start with you first.

[Speaker 13] (32:34 - 33:35)
Thank you, Chairman. I appreciate it. I just want to say that I do support this substitute, and I want to say thank you to CDPH, the mayor's office, as well as my colleagues for hanging in there.

This has been a long haul, a lot of back and forth. We've heard from a lot of different people on this. Is it perfect?

No, but I think it's a step in the right direction. I think CDPH said it very well, that we're working towards more environmental mitigations in our wards to make sure that people don't get sick from the surrounding areas. I just want to say a huge thank you to my colleagues, especially for hanging in there with us and for always checking in to make sure that we were heading in the right direction.

I just want to say thank you again to everybody for their collaboration here.

[Speaker 3] (33:35 - 33:38)
Thank you, Alderman. Alderman Cardenas?

[Speaker 5] (33:41 - 37:07)
Thank you, Chair, and I echo the sentiments of my colleague Sue Garza. I want to also thank, obviously, Thompson and Mike Rodriguez. I'm not sure if he's on the call or not, but it's been a long process.

I think it started out, just like it's ending, with the idea to improve air quality in the city, to have input from community organizations, to have the Alderman have more of a say-so in what happens in the process with adjudicating a lot of the PDs and non-PDs from a development standpoint. I think TDPH has been working on improving standards for a while, and this is where now it's coming to fruition. I've been working with them for a year and a half or so.

When I started out, I wanted to have the CBA take this process and push it forward and bring it to fruition. Unfortunately, there are some things that came out of the CBA that made a lot of us a little uncomfortable, but I think we came to a conclusion that it was really best in our hands. I really believe that.

I think I saw the CBA process, and we wanted to mirror that in this legislation. Look, nobody wins if we don't do anything here. Industry would like us not to pass anything.

I think the environmentalists want a pure ordinance, and I don't see how we achieve that when we have so many stakeholders weighing in one way or the other. I know this much. When we strengthen environmental quality, and especially when it comes to air pollution, companies like Ozinga, when they expand, will now have to abide by more stringent guidelines when it comes to air quality, when it comes to the recycling operations and protecting our waterways like the river where they operate.

All that matters. If we do nothing, then nothing changes, and our residents are still going to be sad by asthma and all these other ailments that come from having poor air quality. I think this takes a step in the right direction.

It's not perfect, but it continues to bring forth more legislation. We don't want to kill the industry. I don't think it does that at all.

I think what it does, it brings them into the table, and we negotiate what's best for both ends, constituents and also development. I think it does that, and I'm a strong proponent of that. I've spoken to the majority of committee members on this, basically weighing in as to why this is important.

I know the majority are going to support this, and I thank them for listening and also weighing in. I know it doesn't affect them all. It affects a few of us, but it doesn't affect them.

It affects them when their constituents have to travel to areas like mine where there's poor air quality, I should say. I appreciate everybody involved, and thank you for your leadership. Chairman, we should move on this today without further delay.

Thank you. Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 3] (37:08 - 37:11)
Alderman Mike Rodriguez. Michael?

[Speaker 14] (37:11 - 39:10)
Thank you, Chairman. It's been a real rollercoaster ride on this ordinance, and I feel from the get, I've been steadfast in my support of increased environmental regulations. At the end of the day, I think that this is about regulation.

First of all, before going to my comments, I wanted to thank Angela Tuvar and Patrick Murphy, who have been steadfast professionals in their fields and very communicative and open to conversations about this initiative. I've played a key role in making sure regulations in our city are strong and will continue to advocate for such, because our communities, particularly those on the southwest side that I represent, have been systematically locations for industrial pollution. If we understand anything from the national scope, President Barack Obama came into office.

He instituted many strong regulations and industry then, and continues to cry foul and purport that the sky is falling. And when strong and reasonable regulation is introduced, especially if that regulation mandates more community engagement, involvement, and oversight, this ordinance does take some steps forward. But to be quite frank, it's not enough.

The concessions that have been made, and one additional concession this weekend, have been very favorable towards industry at the expense of community engagement and support from environmental justice organizations. And for these reasons, this ordinance in its current form has not earned my support, so I will be a no vote. Thank you for the time, Chairman, and I look forward to the further dialogue.

And moving this very important issue forward, this is just one step. We've got a lot more to do and a lot more to engage on, but on this one, I will be a no. Thank you.

[Speaker 3] (39:11 - 39:27)
Thank you, Alderman. And I'm going to ask, before I open up for questions, I know that Alderman Thompson, who's not a member of the committee, but has been steadfast in his interest and impact on his ward, so I'm going to ask him to say a few words and then we'll open it up, starting with Alderman Thompson.

[Speaker 4] (39:30 - 45:47)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and to all my colleagues. This has been a long journey. I want to thank Alderman Sue Garza for her tireless work on this.

I also want to thank Alderman Cardenas for his efforts to get this done. And to all my colleagues, thank you for listening as we talk to you during this process, explain concerns and listen to you as well and understand the issues and standing with us. So I appreciate that to all the stakeholders that have been involved with this, from environmental to the industry folks and everyone that's been concerned about this.

And finally, last but not least, I want to thank the mayor for working with us to craft an ordinance that I believe will have a positive impact on air quality and environmental impacts throughout all of Chicago. And to the mayor's team, as mentioned, who worked many hours helping to craft this ordinance. As some have said, we may not agree on 100% of the provisions.

And my colleague just mentioned he had some concerns about some additional changes. We've had some concerns as well. And, you know, we're not going to agree on 100%.

Some don't think it goes far enough. Some think it goes too far. But I can't say that everyone has had the right intention.

I think that intention is to make Chicago a safer city, to raise our families and to work. It was President Lyndon Johnson who said, a man who wouldn't take a half a loaf never went to bed hungry. And so I think this ordinance is outlined by CDPH, is outlined by Patrick Murphy and others, addresses a lot of the air quality issues by eliminating certain uses in the city.

I don't need to go through those. But also tightening the oversight on more intense recycling, container storage, freight terminal, a lot of those issues. And then as it comes to warehousing wholesaling, to increase those requirements on 10-acre or more developments.

And under 10 acres, I think really to have an impact. And this is so important that these are all going to be LEED certified. These are going to be sustainable built buildings, as well as having the traffic and oversight.

I do have concerns with, you know, the CDPH and the air quality monitoring. Make sure that we fully understand what we're doing there. We have some concerns.

We're going to have to sort of work through those. And if we need to come back and make adjustments because we find that it's not firm enough, we can do that. We need to make adjustments, make sure if it's stifling job growth in the city, then we can always come back and amend it.

And I have some concerns. So I know a lot of my colleagues have mentioned that this is a start. I also have concerns, you know, the map that we showed earlier in the presentation, showing those hotspots.

You know, that map itself, that's from the CDPH 2020 air quality survey. It also went on to say you can't use that map for making regulatory and enforcement decisions. Because that factors in not only pollution, but it's also health and also social and economic issues.

And we've seen that with this pandemic in those same areas. In my community, 60609 zip code, for example, is one of the highest with COVID in those communities where we see health concerns. This does go towards improving health, but there's other issues besides pollution in our communities that we also have to continue to work with CDPH on addressing.

We also have to work in Springfield, in Washington, DC, where we can all make a big difference as well. And that's where we all collectively, whether it be the environmental or the industry side, working together to push our legislators in Washington to address climate change. So, as Alderman Garza and I also talked about, we've gotten more comfortable in talking to administration.

The Department of Planning is committed to completing its review of the Pilsen PMD study, and then conducting the study for Lake Calumet and PMD 6, which should be during more long-term strategic planning. And going forward, looking at PMDs on an annual basis, we have 15 PMDs, 25 in different corridors. We should be reviewing those as things change.

We need to make sure that we're also addressing those issues. So, as the world changes from retail and manufacturing, housing and office, as those change, so must we. So, we must always be on the forefront, so we can be responsive for opportunities in a thoughtful and intelligent manner.

And I do think that this is a great start. It was a good collaboration. It's a long effort, many hours.

And Chairman, I want to thank you, especially as Chairman of this committee, who brought people together on this particular issue and included me to make sure that all of the concerns were addressed. Make sure we're all heard one another. And most importantly, I think this is a great, where we all listen to one another.

We might not agree, but we agreed to disagree and be respectful to one another. So, with that, Chairman, I do thank you for your time and indulgence. I would ask my colleagues on the committee to please support this ordinance.

It's not final. We could always look to address and amend if we need to. But I think for right now, this is an excellent opportunity for us to improve air quality in Chicago.

So, thank you, Mr. Chair.

[Speaker 3] (45:47 - 46:55)
Thank you, Alderman. Before I call on Alderman Beal, I just had a point of clarification and a question, as has come up during this process, was, and I'll start with, first of all, I'll start with Patrick. Patrick, you know, the aldermen are, as Alderman Cardenas says, not too comfortable with the Zoning Board of Appeals.

But in these permitted by right applications, tell us the role of the aldermen in that. And I know the notice requirement requires the alderman to be noticed and also the 250. But let's clarify that particular issue.

And then secondly, I know Department of Health is going to be questioned, but I'll start off with their role in navigating both the community concerns and the manufacturing concerns. And as all of us know, sometimes there's conflict. So, we'll start with you, Patrick, and then move to Dave Graham.

[Speaker 1] (46:56 - 48:15)
Yes, Chairman. So, all of the projects, whether they are planned developments, special uses, or if they're by right, and just to reiterate, we're not changing or expanding any of the special use designations that are in the code today. So, the uses that are permitted or special use are staying as they are.

However, all of those projects will be subject to a site plan review ahead of time. And one of these specific components is the community process of which the alderman will be notified, made aware of, the hosting by the applicant to discuss not only the project details themselves, but also any traffic issues, any overarching environmental evaluation impact issues. It's an opportunity for the community and the alderman to be made aware both of the project and have the opportunity to comment on it in a public forum.

There are explicit rules regarding the notice, including to aldermanic offices, as well as adhering to the notice boundaries that we would otherwise have for a zoning map amendment. So, there is a very specific section that does walk through all of the community aspect and aldermanic notification processes, regardless of the legislative route. By right, special use, or plan development.

It will always apply.

[Speaker 3] (48:15 - 48:26)
So, my assumption is the alderman will be hosting the meeting and directing the departments to answer whatever questions they need under his or her leadership.

[Speaker 1] (48:27 - 48:29)
Well, yes, that is absolutely possible.

[Speaker 3] (48:30 - 48:31)
If that's their desire.

[Speaker 1] (48:31 - 48:41)
Correct. Yes, yes, sir. They can host the meeting, or they can have the applicant lead the meeting with whichever impacted city departments need to be there in order to respond and provide clarification.

[Speaker 3] (48:42 - 48:49)
And they'll also be instrumental in some of the mitigation efforts working with the community and the applicant, correct?

[Speaker 1] (48:50 - 48:50)
Absolutely. Yes, sir.

[Speaker 3] (48:50 - 49:45)
Okay. So now let's move on to what was always a question about air quality. And Dave, would you expound on that a little bit?

I know there are federal guidelines and state guidelines that are part of this issue. Let's say we get down to an issue in Alderman Thompson's ward. And tell us what you do with the report.

And how do you respond to the community? And how do you respond to the alderman when there needs to be corrective actions and there's dispute? So with that, what role is the alderman going to play assisting your department?

Dave, you need to unmute yourself.

[Speaker 2] (49:48 - 52:58)
Somebody put me on mute. Sorry. Thank you.

First and foremost, the idea is that there will be an air traffic study to look at what the impact of air quality would be. And then also with that is to take a look and see what that future operations is going to be to determine what the impact on the community would be. And so when I talk about existing federal standards, how these get looked at is codified, for lack of a better word.

So you do a traffic study in a specific way. And that traffic study will tell you the number of vehicles. And based on the number of vehicles, you can determine what those emissions are.

And so through US EPA's MOVES program or computer software, then based on that, you can look and see what are the impacts from vehicular traffic. You can also look at modeling that's done through AEROMOD to determine what are the future activities at this site and how that would be a problem or could be a problem. So we would work with the alderman so that they understood what the risk could be and how that works with the developer, you know, whoever owns the property, whatever they're going to do.

We can guide them and let them know these are the things that you need to correct and these are how they need. This is how they should be corrected. So we would work with the alderman to make sure that everybody understood.

So I did a lot of brownfields work throughout the city before I took this position. So the best way I can frame it is because folks have a valid concern about what does this mean to have a new facility come in your area. On brownfield sites, you could have facilities that may have been operating for 100 years.

But I've seen sites where, you know, they're really not dirty. So the goal for the project is to identify in advance for the alderman and their constituents how this could impact their neighborhoods and how we could mitigate those neighborhoods. And, you know, the concern is that if you live in an area that does have some particular health issues or does have some other issues, you know, the impact on them is more than what you would see just from a general population.

So the goal is, as we move forward, identify those issues that we see, answer questions, and mitigate those issues. And we would do that with working through the alderman to make sure that their folks understand what's happening.

[Speaker 3] (52:59 - 53:18)
And this is all done in a really preventative way, right? Let's make sure when designing these PDs and expansion or developments of these projects that they know what could be the problems and maybe to address them in the planning phase rather than a reactive phase.

[Speaker 2] (53:19 - 54:46)
Yes, that's correct. I mean, we more or less do that now. You know, somebody will go through zoning and they're interested in creating something new in the community.

And zoning reaches out to us and asks, do you have any concerns? So I think the benefit of doing it this way is that everybody understands what the issues are. And if there are ways that we can mitigate those issues, then we can identify those ahead of time.

Because then we're working hand-in-hand with the people who live in the community. We're working hand-in-hand with the alderman who work closely with them. And then we're also working with the developers to make sure they understand what to expect and what's not going to be acceptable.

So I'll give you a quick example. So on rock crushing activities, that is something that can be managed pretty well. You can water and you can manage all of that.

And so there are concerns on those that can be handled pretty easily. But then we would also work with zoning. And that's all their decision.

It's just like, does it make sense for this business to come in? So at the end of the day, we'll be working with zoning to inform their opinion with the alderman.

[Speaker 3] (54:48 - 55:07)
All right, Dave, I know you'll be on the call for a while here with questions. Sure. For the record, Deborah Silverstein, not a committee member, though, is in attendance.

As obviously Alderman LaSvada and others, I think. But I will go now to Alderman Beal.

[Speaker 10] (55:08 - 55:39)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just have a couple of questions here. And again, let me just go back in.

And I want to thank each and every one of the sponsors. I know they've been working hard to get to this point. And I really want to commend each and every one of them for their hard work and determination on working towards this ordinance.

But I do have a couple of quick questions. The first one is, you know, at the end of the day, who has the final say so in approval over this ordinance?

[Speaker 2] (55:39 - 57:15)
I would defer to zoning. We would provide the rationale for why something makes sense and then provide information on what the potential impacts would be. And I know folks are particularly concerned about truck traffic.

And I think with the change in fuel standards and the less miles traveled or more miles traveled per gallon, those are things that I think projects that don't normally go through a larger review and analysis, we will force folks to show this is what the impact is going to be. And then the other concern is that we always say, what's the actual facility? So if you have a new facility that's coming in and we'll make sure that what they're proposing, that they will agree to that so that everyone knows what the potential impacts on the neighborhood is going to be.

I mean, that's the key to all this. It's now we are, we will be looking a little bit closer on what the impacts could be on the future use and then tie into that the vehicular traffic. And that's all pretty well established methodology.

[Speaker 10] (57:17 - 57:19)
I'd like to hear from Patrick.

[Speaker 3] (57:19 - 57:29)
Let me get from Patrick too, because he's obviously, David said that he would make that recommendation to the Department of Planning and Zoning. Patrick?

[Speaker 1] (57:29 - 58:15)
Yes. Yes. So ultimately it would come down to three different classifications.

If the project is, would trigger a plan development, then all of the analysis that Dave discussed, as well as the analysis by the Department of Transportation and from the zoning, would be crafted into a recommendation to the plan commission that would go to committee on zoning subsequent to the plan development hearing. If it's a special use, those same recommendations would be transmitted to the zoning board as a recommendation for the special use request. And if it is permitted by right, then that recommendation would be coming from the zoning administrator's office to the applicant as a part of their permit process.

So depending on the avenue that the project has to take legislatively, the final decision on the recommendation would come from one of three different sources.

[Speaker 10] (58:17 - 58:20)
Okay. So you have a three-way split on recommendation.

[Speaker 1] (58:22 - 58:42)
Well, it's just a path that it would go through. So today, if a special use were to be filed and it had nothing to do with the site plan review process, the Department of Planning would issue a recommendation to the zoning board of appeals. That same step would still take place.

It's just our recommendation could not happen until we went through all the site plan review criteria that are proposed in this ordinance.

[Speaker 10] (58:42 - 58:45)
What if the alderman disagreed with the zoning board of appeals?

[Speaker 1] (58:46 - 59:09)
Well, if the alderman is opposed to the project prior to the zoning board's decision, we would be working with the alderman to address what their concerns are, first of all. If the alderman is still opposed to whatever the project is, we would still want to work with them to have them appear at the hearing, explain their objections and why, so that the zoning board hears it directly from the alderman about their community.

[Speaker 10] (59:11 - 59:35)
We've already had scenarios where zoning board of appeals has already gone against the alderman on numerous occasions with a bunch of my colleagues. And so that is a huge concern that I have, that once again, we're giving up more jurisdiction to the zoning board of appeals instead of the legislative body. We're given authority to appointed people and not elected people.

[Speaker 3] (59:35 - 1:00:07)
So alderman, I think that was the crux of the substitute and the concern that many of us have had. But avenue number three, I think is what Alderman Beal wants to get to. So it's by right and you have CDOT, you have your department and health.

And how are you going to work on a controversial project that maybe the alderman is not supportive of and the department when there's tension?

[Speaker 1] (1:00:09 - 1:00:52)
Well, so I guess, first of all, Alderman Beal, I just wanted to say that like Alderman Tunney said, that was the specific difference that we made. We did not expand any of the zoning board authority through this amended ordinance. But then to Alderman Tunney's last point, we would still work with the alderman offices and the alderman themselves and the community, regardless of the legislative route that the project would take.

So whether it's by right, special use or a plan development, we would still be working with all of your offices as we review the project, as it goes through the community review, as groups that are in support or opposed to it, review the information, come through the community meetings that the applicant has. We will still work with your offices on all three avenues.

[Speaker 10] (1:00:52 - 1:01:02)
Okay. I just need to know point blank, Pat. If the alderman disagrees with the zoning board of appeals, is there an avenue for the alderman to have final say?

[Speaker 1] (1:01:04 - 1:01:17)
If the zoning board of appeals issues a decision that is counter to what an alderman's position is, the avenue for appeal would be through the circuit court. And that exists today under legislative rules that exist today for special uses.

[Speaker 10] (1:01:18 - 1:01:46)
Okay. All right. So I just hope the rest of my colleagues just heard that plain and clear.

Also, you mentioned that the alderman or the applicant can host a community meeting. So therefore, there's another avenue where if the developer disagrees with the alderman, you're telling me now the developer can have a town hall meeting on a project that the alderman may be either for or against for approval?

[Speaker 1] (1:01:47 - 1:02:22)
Well, the ordinance is structured, first of all, to mirror the cannabis ordinances community meeting requirements. So there is at least one community meeting that's required. We were not explicit that it needs to be hosted by an alderman or that it can only be by an applicant.

We want to work with whomever the alderman is and whomever the applicant is to make sure that the information is out there regardless of who actually hosts the meeting. And it doesn't have to just be one meeting. So we left it flexible so that it can evolve depending on the type of project and the circumstances.

[Speaker 10] (1:02:24 - 1:02:51)
Okay. Well, that's just another scenario. Because if there's a town hall meeting on a project, whether the alderman is there or not, we're going to be blamed one way or the other either for or against if we're not participating and it's being hosted by somebody else.

So that's neither here nor there. Next, the approval of the site plan has to be approved by Department of Planning? Is that also part of this?

[Speaker 1] (1:02:51 - 1:03:28)
So right now, site plan review authority, if there is no other legislative action, so if it's a permitted by right use, put aside this ordinance. If it's a permitted by right use and there is a site plan review requirement, then yes, for a by right project, then yes, that approval authority rests with the Zoning Bureau from DPD. However, if there's a special use or a plan development component to that project, then as opposed to an outright approval, it becomes a recommendation to either of those voting bodies.

And if it goes through the plan development process to plan commission, then that ultimate decision would sit with city council and the committee on zoning.

[Speaker 10] (1:03:29 - 1:03:29)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:03:29 - 1:03:30)
Those steps.

[Speaker 10] (1:03:31 - 1:04:06)
Let me just give you a quick scenario. I mean, I just had a Culver's that was held up by about six to eight months because the commissioner of planning wouldn't sign off on a site plan that Culver's and I agreed with. And it wasn't until Culver's wrote a letter that they were about to pull out that the project got approved.

So what would be the process on a situation like that, where you have Culver's and the alderman in agreement with a site plan, but the commissioner disagrees. What's the avenue for approval as far as the community and the alderman over the objection of a commissioner. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:06 - 1:04:41)
So that project was slightly different than this scenario in that that was a site plan approval process specifically laid out through an existing plan development. So there, so all plan developments have site plan approval allowances that allow for administrative review and approval of a whole variety of, of, of issues within PDs, not necessarily limited to drive. In instances like that going forward, though, we would want to work more closely with your office to make sure that what you're reviewing and what the applicant wants to see done is reviewed in tandem with the department.

So there isn't that type of miscommunication going forward.

[Speaker 10] (1:04:42 - 1:04:48)
Okay. I just have two more questions. Mr. Chairman, I'll be done. Um, when does this ordinance take effect?

[Speaker 1] (1:04:50 - 1:05:05)
Uh, there is no, there is no forecasted, uh, date for it to take effect. So upon approval by the full council and signature by the mayor and publication, it would take effect as, as a normal ordinance. We did not put out a forward date in this case.

[Speaker 10] (1:05:05 - 1:05:05)
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:05:06 - 1:05:09)
So it would run through the regular, regular signature and approval process.

[Speaker 10] (1:05:10 - 1:05:25)
Okay. All right. Last question, Tony on round one.

Okay. I just, okay. Round one.

Okay. And the second question is once again, the commissioner of health has to sign off on an air quality ordinance before this thing is also approved, not an air quality ordinance.

[Speaker 1] (1:05:25 - 1:06:11)
So two components of the site plan review will be a specific analysis by the department of transportation related to the traffic impact, whatever that may be, whatever the vehicles may be and whatever the cumulative effect may be, they would have to provide a recommendation to zoning concurrent with that. The department of public health would have to review air impact, an air impact analysis that's not just limited to vehicles and it might vary depending on the actual use that's proposed. We're, we're running a whole gamut of intensive industrial uses here.

So that department of public department of public health commissioner would also have to provide a recommendation to zoning. And only once those two recommendations are received with zoning, consider the application complete. And then we would start our, we would, we would finalize our reviews.

[Speaker 10] (1:06:11 - 1:06:13)
Okay. All right. I'm done.

[Speaker 3] (1:06:13 - 1:06:17)
Um, we're for round two then if you want to go on.

[Speaker 10] (1:06:18 - 1:06:23)
Well, I just want to, I just want to offer up my friendly amendments if I can. So they're on the record, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 3] (1:06:23 - 1:06:47)
Well, um, we, we, I know Vicki crafts on the call. So given the fact that we do not have a written copy of this notice, the clerk, I would like to amend it on its face, Mr. Chairman. Let me just ask, uh, our, uh, Vicki craft, would you opine?

I think the alderman would like to offer a friendly amendment.

[Speaker 16] (1:06:50 - 1:06:51)
Can you hear me alderman?

[Speaker 3] (1:06:52 - 1:06:53)
We can.

[Speaker 16] (1:06:53 - 1:07:57)
You can. Uh, yes. Well, uh, this issue is governed by rule 41 of the city council rules of procedure.

And, uh, those rules provide that, you know, unless you're talking about, you know, just correcting a typographical error or a punctuation mistake, uh, the type of, uh, amendment, unless that's the amendment he's proposing, which I adapt the type of amendment alderman deal is proposing as a substantive amendment to the ordinance that's in front of you and pursuant to rule 41. Um, it would be out of order for the committee to vote on that amendment, unless and until a formal amendment, uh, has been prepared and copies of it distributed to all of the committee members so that the committee and the committee members know exactly what it is that they're voting on. So it would have to be reduced to a writing in order for the committee to proceed.

And that writing would have to be distributed to all members of the committee for them to.

[Speaker 3] (1:07:58 - 1:08:33)
So I'm going to ask that, um, we move on and as Alderman Beal knows, and many of the other aldermen have said, this is, this is a day in the life of the air quality ordinance. And as we move forward, uh, I think that we're going to have to react in different ways about, um, whether it's moving to more stringent control or more, uh, business friendly control. So I'm going to ask, uh, that that's out of order and I'm going to move to Alderman Hadden.

Alderman Hadden.

[Speaker 7] (1:08:34 - 1:08:55)
Thank you chair. Um, I've got a couple of questions and some comments to share. So, um, first a couple clarifying questions, um, and this might be for Patrick Murphy, um, on the slides, could you just let me know the difference between class three recycling versus some of the other classes?

[Speaker 1] (1:09:01 - 1:09:05)
Yes. Um, hold on a second.

[Speaker 7] (1:09:06 - 1:09:10)
Sorry. I know that's really specific. I just was noting the difference and wondering.

[Speaker 1] (1:09:11 - 1:09:38)
No, no, that's okay. I, I had a audio glitch, so I had to, I had to switch real quick here. Hold on a second.

So, uh, I will put, I want to see if we could go back to the PowerPoint, I may have it on the bottom of one of the slides, just a breakout of all the different, uh, generalizations of the different types of classes for recycling. If not Alderman, um, we can run through just generally speaking, what you're asking about. Generally, if you go to the chart, it might be on the bottom.

[Speaker 17] (1:09:50 - 1:09:53)
One moment. I'm having computer problems as well.

[Speaker 7] (1:09:54 - 1:09:55)
Thank you. Yes.

[Speaker 1] (1:09:58 - 1:11:39)
Alderman, while she's pulling that up, uh, essentially what we've excluded from this are the class one and class two, which are the lowest intensity of the recycling facilities. Those are going to be your class ones, your typical, uh, manual separation of, uh, products that you would collect outside in the blue in the blue bins outside of your, your home or your business. Uh, then a class two is going to deal with the processing that goes through for those types of, uh, uh, glass paper, rubber type of items, as well as organic waste.

So those are the lowest intensity of the recycling facilities. They are allowed in other zoning districts beyond M and PMD. And so we did, we did not include those in the ordinance.

The ones that we started with were the class three. So that starts with the composting of both of the, uh, lower intensity types of uses. And the composting is already addressed in the, uh, use standards that we're modifying as a part of this proposed ordinance.

Then you start getting to the class four A's and four B's. Now you're starting to deal with the vehicles and not only the vehicle itself, but also the method by which it is broken down, whether it's crushed shredded used by hand tools, going from an A to a B increases the intensity. And that's specifically what we were addressing of the intensive recycling facilities.

And then finally we get to the class five, which generally speaking, we're going to be your, uh, demolition and construction, demolition and construction debris and the crushing and sorting of those products. So we're talking of the four highest intensity classifications of recycling facilities. And then that are unique to the manufacturing and plan manufacturing districts.

[Speaker 7] (1:11:40 - 1:12:44)
Thank you for that clarification. I appreciate you taking the time for that. Um, so it's just a curiosity.

Um, so I've got a question and, and I'm not sure who this is for. Um, maybe one of the lead sponsors, um, perhaps, I'm wondering why was warehousing wholesaling and free, um, movement changed at the last minute? Um, because thinking about the, if we're looking at really improving the air quality for residents in our city, um, that would have a significant impact, right.

To have more of a say, um, and to hold to higher standards, um, those industries. So can someone speak to why that was removed? And I asked this as someone who supported the original ordinance, um, was asked to be, um, uh, you know, uh, a lead on this when lead sponsors, some lead sponsors removed their support from the original ordinance.

Um, and up until last week was speaking with colleagues, right. About how important this was to air quality. So just for some context.

[Speaker 3] (1:12:47 - 1:12:54)
All right, Patrick, do you want, or do you want to ask one of the sponsors, um, or all of them?

[Speaker 7] (1:12:54 - 1:13:02)
One of the sponsors, or if, um, you know, someone, someone else from policy or policy or CDPH want to speak to this, why it was okay.

[Speaker 5] (1:13:02 - 1:13:56)
Madam. Uh, I mean, uh, chair, chair, this is part of the nest. Um, I, I've, um, obviously I've been working on this feverishly with a lot of members and Patrick Murphy, and we talked about this, uh, you know, uh, and this was done, uh, to lay some fears, um, from Alderman Thompson about affecting warehousing, small scale warehousing in his district.

Uh, and Patrick, uh, and I talked about this and I asked, uh, poignantly about how does it, how does this in fact, um, you know, legislation, the legislation and the attempts that we're trying to, um, uh, to accomplish in our quality. And he said, um, it doesn't, it is, it was a distance that there was in there to standardize, uh, because it was done, um, in many other ordinances. Patrick, can you, can you illuminate on that and explain more of a technical analysis on what we talked about?

[Speaker 1] (1:13:57 - 1:14:00)
Sure. Oh, go ahead. Chairman.

[Speaker 3] (1:14:00 - 1:14:04)
No, Patrick, Patrick Murphy is what I'm saying. Oh, yeah. Patrick.

[Speaker 1] (1:14:05 - 1:14:09)
Okay. Alderman Garza, did you? Oh, okay.

Sure.

[Speaker 13] (1:14:09 - 1:14:23)
I, I, you know, I, I, yeah, thank you. I, I just think that, um, Alderman Thompson has a great example of, um, of a coffee. Um, you know, he, I don't know if Alderman Thompson, if you want to take this one, you have a great example.

[Speaker 3] (1:14:23 - 1:14:28)
All right. So, uh, which Patrick would like to, uh, and.

[Speaker 5] (1:14:29 - 1:14:33)
Chairman, I would like Patrick Murphy to talk as well, but Patrick Thompson has, does have an example.

[Speaker 3] (1:14:34 - 1:14:37)
Wait a second. Wait a second. Alderman Cardenas.

I think I'm the chairman of this committee.

[Speaker 5] (1:14:38 - 1:14:40)
So. No, I understand. I'm just, you know, thank you.

[Speaker 3] (1:14:40 - 1:14:45)
So we're going to, we're going to get to, we're going to get to both Patrick's, but who would like to start?

[Speaker 1] (1:14:46 - 1:14:49)
I can defer to the Alderman. That's fine. Whatever he prefers.

[Speaker 4] (1:14:51 - 1:15:01)
Patrick, the first. You know, I raised my hand to try to respond, but you know, you're the chair. So however you, well, I can give it.

[Speaker 3] (1:15:02 - 1:15:10)
I mean, Alderman, give us the example that Alderman Garza was talking about just so to put it into some practical terms.

[Speaker 4] (1:15:10 - 1:16:48)
Sure. Sure. So Alderman Hayden, the, the under, you know, the 10 acres above are, those are the bigger, uh, facilities that we're talking about that has the truck traffic that has the, the more congestion that could create traffic pollution.

And so those are all done as a plan development, uh, underneath there with the safeguards that we have put in place by building these as sustainable and with the site plan, which requires traffic and air study, we, in a sense, we're, we're getting a getting the same or similar type of oversight. Uh, but I had a, uh, coffee shop that opened up. We went to the opening on Friday and it's a coffee shop that also has a bean roaster about 1800 square feet.

Okay. So the coffee shop is over from six 30 to three after three o'clock they convert and they start the bean roaster and they do wholesale bean sales. Well, that would technically be a wholesale.

And so an 1800 square foot would have to be a plan development, which isn't what we were getting at. And I think what we were all trying to achieve here were the larger, you know, the big warehouse facilities. And, and most of those, the size of those are the 10 acres or more.

So we capture that with the PD and this was more of a practical, there's a lot of smaller size, uh, warehouse wholesalers like, uh, uh, now I'll do a, uh, a plug the bad owl on Morgan street. So it's a great coffee shop, but wholesalers like that, uh, that, that, uh, would be impacted on this ordinance. And I think that was the unintended.

[Speaker 3] (1:16:49 - 1:16:57)
All right. So Patrick Murphy, is there anything else you wanted to, uh, add to Alderman Thompson's, uh, uh, situation?

[Speaker 1] (1:16:58 - 1:17:39)
No, not to the specific situation, but just to build on what Alderman Cardenas said, we did craft in this version, the substitute that's in front of you to build on the plan development triggers and exemptions that exist in manufacturing districts for industrial uses. So we, we built on not being more strenuous than that from a size standpoint for these, uh, warehousing wholesaling and freight movement uses. So like Alderman Cardenas was saying, we built on existing PD triggers, and that's why those are slightly different without the 660 foot buffer, uh, trigger than all of the other, far more intensive uses, the recycling and waste management, uh, waste related uses.

[Speaker 3] (1:17:39 - 1:17:50)
All right. Alderman Hatton. Thank you.

Uh, thank you. Thank you Alderman Cardenas, uh, by the way, uh, my fellow chairman. Alderman Hatton.

[Speaker 7] (1:17:50 - 1:18:25)
I appreciate that. Uh, so then I guess another question, um, is, um, and this is for Dave from CDPH, right? This is supposed to be about air quality, um, and improving air quality.

So I'm wondering, you know, as proposed as this ordinance, is it going to meaningfully actually reduce disparities in air pollution, um, between city neighborhoods? Cause really like that's the bigger issue we're trying to address. So will this meaningfully, um, have an impact to decrease decrease disparity in the air pollution suffered by residents in different neighborhoods in the city?

[Speaker 2] (1:18:26 - 1:19:57)
Um, sure. So, you know, I've mentioned this before, so we meet, uh, Patrick staff, uh, we'll call us and say, Hey, there's, there's this facility company. What do you think?

And then sometimes we're like, this is not good. Meaning there, it could be something that's intensive. Like I always go back to rock crushing because it's something that people can understand and see.

Um, and it also be somebody who does some type of manufacturing. Like, so for instance, there is a company in the city called OxyChem. So in my, in my mind, when I heard OxyChem, I think of the East coast accidental chemical, which was involved with a whole bunch of things like love canal.

And so immediately I go through and I see, Oh, they make glass. They don't, they don't really generate anything. What you see is steam.

So the goal would be if we see something that's an issue, then we would now have the ability to, to tell them, these are the things you need to fix and make sure that are not a problem. So we would head off those things ahead of time and make recommendations to zoning to say, you know what this, unless they can guarantee they're going to do X, Y, and Z, um, that's, you know, that's our recommendation. And, and we, we've made, we've been on other projects.

Uh, I had mentioned, uh, Dave, Dave, um, we all got examples.

[Speaker 3] (1:19:57 - 1:20:12)
Okay. We got witnesses here answering the question. I'm not going to answer it for you, but that originally was, uh, was a yes or no.

She's talking about, are we moving in the right direction? Yes. All right.

All of Manhattan. Okay.

[Speaker 7] (1:20:12 - 1:21:44)
Um, thanks Sharon. And thanks Dave. Um, I guess the last piece I'll, I'll ask and kind of put forth.

Um, so I have strong concerns about this ordinance. I have strong concerns about the path this ordinance has taken, um, the influences that have led us to this version. Um, and you know, there were, um, a lot of our environmental groups, and we talk about improving air quality and we talk about supporting environmental justice and the health of our residents, some of our best partners in pushing us forward because as government we're often really slow, right?

Um, the city of Chicago doesn't have a good record in my opinion, um, uh, on protecting environmental health of their residents. So there were large environmental groups and small neighborhood based ones that were in support of the original version of this ordinance. And now they have all pulled their support.

Um, so, um, for, um, for, you know, Alderman Daley Thompson for Alderman Sadowski Garza, for Alderman Cardenas, can you tell me which of our Chicago environmental organizations are currently for it? Cause I know on file here, we've got the Illinois Environmental Council, the Respiratory Health Association, the Center for Neighborhood Technology, the Nature Conservancy, the Chicago Environmental Justice Network, and the Natural Resources Defense Council in opposition to it, all groups who I respect strongly and who had previously supported. So why would environmental groups pull their support?

And can you tell me which environmental groups are you working with that support this current version?

[Speaker 3] (1:21:44 - 1:22:16)
So before I ask Dave to speak, I just want to reiterate for the record, um, as of this morning, um, we gave, there's three organizations that are in objection to it. So we have not, for instance, I, we have not heard from the Chicago Respiratory Council. Uh, the ones that we have are Illinois Environmental Council, the lawyers committee, uh, to civil rights, Chicago lawyers committee, and then, um, stream, uh, stream.

[Speaker 14] (1:22:16 - 1:22:25)
I have information, Alderman Rodriguez, that IEC letter has a number of institutions that are also signed on. Oh, I'm sorry.

[Speaker 3] (1:22:25 - 1:22:44)
So I'm sorry. Thank, thank you. It is signed by Respiratory Health Center for Neighborhood.

Yeah. Nature Conservancy. Yeah.

So. Okay. And then as Alderman Beals said, yes.

Okay. So rephrase the question and, uh, and let's get an answer.

[Speaker 7] (1:22:47 - 1:22:59)
Sure. So I, I don't, I'll, I'll just say it again, which environmental groups are you working with, or that currently support this ordinance that is meant to improve environmental health of our residents?

[Speaker 3] (1:22:59 - 1:23:09)
All right. So I think, that's for the department of health or, or the, or the sponsors or the lead sponsors.

[Speaker 13] (1:23:13 - 1:24:57)
This is Alderman Garza. Um, we did meet with environmental groups, Patrick, um, Daley Thompson and myself did meet with environmental groups. Um, one of the things that, um, the, this current version has more environmental controls than the original ordinance.

The original ordinance did not have to build to the green sustainability policy policy. The original ordinance did not have an air quality study. We have way more environmental controls in this substitute than we did moving forward on the first one.

So, um, nobody knows better than me on, on what's happening with air quality and, and the largest planned manufacturing district in the whole city of Chicago. I also have the international port authority in my ward and we have to look at, at, at a balance also between industry and, um, you know, we don't want jobs that are going to make people sick, but we have to also be aware of people need to put food on their table and, and have jobs as well. And I'm, my ward is very unique in the fact that I have, again, the international port authority from 92nd street to 137th and, um, the, the environmental groups that we met with, some were in favor, some were not in favor.

Um, I think Patrick, you know, we said, um, look, when you, you go to the negotiating table, if everybody walks away feeling like they did not get everything they wanted, then you did something right. Um, this was a long, long drawn out process and I'm very comfortable with, with how this is right now. I think we're moving in the right direction and it's stronger than the original Alderman head.

[Speaker 7] (1:24:58 - 1:26:23)
Um, thanks. Uh, I appreciate that. I did not hear an answer, um, but I won't, I won't push the question.

I'll just say, um, for our colleagues on this committee, I'm not supporting this at this time and I don't know if it needs to be held to be worked with more or not. Um, but I urge you if you haven't been very involved in this to really consider, I know there are a lot of, um, there are a lot of competing pieces there, like, you know, the commercial piece, the industry piece, the Aldermanic piece. Um, but also this is ultimately as it is named, supposed to be about air quality, supposed to be about improving the health of our residents.

We're in the middle of a global pandemic. Our public health disparities are gross, um, in the city. And as, as someone who felt strongly in support of this and has removed my support And then seeing all of our environmental groups who were strongly in support of this for their support.

I just leave that out there for you to think about why that might be. Um, if this is really, um, in the best interest, um, Alderman Cardenas said nobody wins if we do nothing, but I think that it can be harmful sometimes to pass what seems like reform and what seems like something quality. Um, and it really isn't.

Um, because if it isn't, then we're not going to come back to it. We're not going to address the real underlying causes. And I think that is dangerous.

So thank you chair.

[Speaker 3] (1:26:24 - 1:26:26)
Thank you. Um, Alderman, uh, Pat Dahl.

[Speaker 15] (1:26:30 - 1:27:11)
Uh, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Uh, this question's for Patrick. Um, Patrick, I have in my ward, uh, rail yards, existing rail yards that are probably go above the 10 acres and more threshold.

Um, just, and those, uh, rail yards have a number of trucks that, you know, run through the community off of the Dan Ryan through streets like 47th street, 51st street. How does this ordinance impact those existing facility? And how are you thinking about getting them under the tent of this ordinance?

[Speaker 1] (1:27:15 - 1:28:02)
So there's probably two answers to that question. One presuming it's not zone T for transportation, which some freight and commuter rail lines can be, but we'll presume for the sake of the argument, it's not zone T. The way you described it would probably fall under one of two classifications.

Most likely though, being a freight terminal, depending on how they're transferring the goods. It may also be a distribution facility. Like we were talking about with Alderman Thompson earlier in both cases, if the size.

So, well, I guess let me back up. First of all, we did not change any of the designation. So be it permitted by right or a special use under the freight terminal.

That's one aspect that it will still remain. Then if it exceeds 10 acres and is a warehousing distribution site, then it would trigger an automatic plan development under this ordinance.

[Speaker 15] (1:28:04 - 1:28:05)
It's existing though.

[Speaker 1] (1:28:06 - 1:28:32)
Okay. So if they're, if they are existing, we're not retroactively applying this to any current uses. It would only apply in the case of an expansion or expansion of the existing facility, or if something is established new.

So for any of the existing operations, regardless of whether they have a freight movement involved or not, they would still proceed under their current zoning classifications and approvals moving forward. It would only be once they expand operations.

[Speaker 15] (1:28:35 - 1:28:55)
So let's say they they're not going to expand. Is there any way in, I mean, have you given any thought to how to go back because they are having an impact on, you know, air quality in the community. So how do you go back and try to get them to be in compliance with this ordinance?

[Speaker 1] (1:28:56 - 1:29:30)
So that, that, but the inability for us to do that would not be just limited to this ordinance in any type of zoning ordinance. If we propose if a new regulation is approved by council, regardless of what the use is that's involved, we would not in, in nearly all cases be, we would not be able to apply that retroactively to someone who was lawfully established before, whether they were established one day before or 20 years before, we would not be able to, we would not be able to apply that in reverse. It would only be going forward to the degree they change their use or expand their intensity or size.

[Speaker 15] (1:29:33 - 1:29:34)
All right. Thank you.

[Speaker 3] (1:29:35 - 1:30:21)
Yeah. But Patrick, while Almondale is on the line, I think it would behoove her ability to work with the issues in the community, regardless of this ordinance and try to mitigate without as you know, having the, the, the ordinance backing her up. And I know it's a big issue on the South side.

And, you know, just because you're not going to be, you'll be preexisting nonconforming. I would say, as I remember it, I think at some point the department of health and, and, and, and planning might, might have a nice meeting with the, with these operators. If there were, I think they would be, will hopefully be willing to sit at the table.

[Speaker 15] (1:30:23 - 1:30:35)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. That's actually an excellent point. And Patrick and David, is this something that you can make a commitment to do from the zoning standpoint?

[Speaker 1] (1:30:35 - 1:30:54)
I can certainly make a commitment to sitting down with you and the operator to look at what they're doing. And to the degree they need further approvals from the city or they need additional permits, then to, to, to whatever extent they are, they have that requirement. We can certainly talk about mitigation efforts.

Absolutely. I would absolutely participate. All right, David.

[Speaker 2] (1:30:56 - 1:31:00)
Yes, certainly. I mean, I can give one example. Yeah.

Anyways, nobody wants to do an example.

[Speaker 15] (1:31:00 - 1:31:03)
The example, if the chairman.

[Speaker 3] (1:31:04 - 1:31:08)
All right, David, a quick example that they can.

[Speaker 2] (1:31:10 - 1:31:21)
Norfolk Southern. We had an issue with their load shifters. And we asked them to put electric load shifters in.

I don't know if they were electric, but they were lower emissions.

[Speaker 15] (1:31:23 - 1:31:25)
Okay. I remember that. Thank you.

[Speaker 3] (1:31:25 - 1:31:29)
Thank you. Chairman Dow. Alderman La Spada.

[Speaker 12] (1:31:29 - 1:32:07)
Thank you so much, chairman. Glad for this conversation, but I do have a number of questions related to the ordinance. Someone from CDPH spoke much earlier on in the hearing about mitigation strategies to explore, as he put it.

And. I was curious why we're still at the exploration phase of some of these mitigation strategies. If they work, why aren't we just incorporating them?

Is there someone from CDPH who can speak to that for me?

[Speaker 2] (1:32:07 - 1:32:28)
Well, explore is the, you know. People much farther than me can pick apart the words. We wouldn't explore.

We would investigate which ones would be the most. What should you use? Now we could explore if you think there's an issue, but there's many mitigations that are already out there that are existing.

[Speaker 12] (1:32:31 - 1:32:46)
Yeah, but you see what I'm getting at, Dave? Like if there are some that work, yes, we can tailor based on what the site is. But are there mitigation strategies that are going to be required of these facilities?

How does that fit into this ordinance?

[Speaker 2] (1:32:48 - 1:33:44)
So if we know, I'll go back to the rock crusher. So if we, and we've done this before, if we know somebody is going to come in and do rock crushing, and there's something that's above and beyond what the current rules are, what we could do is say, listen, you know, you've got these controls in place. You're going to be watering.

You're going to, we recommend that you use a higher efficiency street cleaner. And on top of that, we're going to ask you to put up air monitoring. Those are the type of things that we would ask that could go above and beyond.

Conversely, you know, if there's a facility that has an opportunity for expanding its truck fleet, we might recommend to planning, make sure that you have that facility EV ready. And these are the things that we would ask to add as we look at ways to mitigate potential impact on the neighborhood.

[Speaker 12] (1:33:47 - 1:34:40)
Okay. I appreciate that, sir. My second question was trying to understand the, the 660 foot standard for the distance between where certain industries could be cited from parks and residentially zoned spaces, commercially owned spaces.

So I was, I was mapping this out. By example, like I live at Belden and Campbell, 660 feet as a standard means from Belden to Fullerton, it's like less than an eighth of a mile on Fullerton. You could be building these facilities.

And I just know like if that was in my neck of the woods, people would really be pushing me for a longer standard. So why, why 660 feet? Is that tied to the length?

[Speaker 3] (1:34:40 - 1:34:44)
Let's ask Patrick because that's a pretty good.

[Speaker 1] (1:34:44 - 1:36:27)
Sure. Lucia, if you could put up, there's a map in the presentation that shows a 660 feet distance around all of the designated plan manufacturing districts and the impact on residential properties. So Alderman 660 feet was used for two reasons.

One, it gives us a uniform standard that is very easily, easy to understand in the sense that it is one city block. Secondarily, that was the map. Go back.

There you go. It might, it might need to be zoomed in, but what this map shows, I'll get back to another point to you in a second. Alderman, what this map shows is around all of the plan manufacturing districts in the city, which are, which are highlighted in orange, filled in, in orange, then the pink or reddish boundary around those represent a 660 foot buffer away from the plan manufacturing districts.

And then in between that pink buffer and the orange plan manufacturing district are the designations of property that have a residential zoning classification. So these are the particular properties that we wanted to highlight to show that there are sensitive zoning districts with sensitive uses within very close proximity to nearly every plan manufacturing district in the city. And those are the areas we wanted to provide the protection to, for mitigation purposes.

So Alderman, my second point, about the 660 feet beyond it being a, a, a, an easily to describe distance is that it is a distance that's used otherwise in the zoning code formerly and currently to designate distances that we want to protect from. So this was a, a repeatable and consistent distance and it's specifically used to capture areas that are particularly adjacent to our PMD and M zoning.

[Speaker 3] (1:36:28 - 1:36:35)
So, so back to your, let me ask Daniel next question. Sure. No comment.

I'm sorry.

[Speaker 12] (1:36:36 - 1:36:50)
Well, it's a question and it's a comment, right? Because I don't doubt that it is easily repeatable, a standardized distance. My question is, is why, why is this an adequate distance from a health data perspective?

[Speaker 1] (1:36:52 - 1:37:47)
I can let somebody from DPH speak to the, the air movement and the health, the health data, but I will speak from the zoning side of it is we wanted to have something that provided a significant distance and it's been a distance that we have used before. And so I know that it is a defensible amount of protection to be applying. We would not be accused of being overly aggressive by having this distance because of the impact it could have on applicants.

Were we to say it had to be a mile that might be seen as being too difficult for applicants to adhere to that might create too much of a burden. This is something we know that we've been able to defend in the past. And so it provided us a very good framework to lay out the guidelines of this ordinance.

Now that's also not to say it can't be expanded, but we wanted to start at a distance that gave some protection, both to the sensitive sides of the community, as well as gave some very, some very consistent predictability to the industrial operators that would be impacted.

[Speaker 12] (1:37:50 - 1:38:01)
I understand the legal defensibility. Dave, do you have a health defensibility in terms of why CDPH felt like this was a reasonable standard?

[Speaker 2] (1:38:04 - 1:38:50)
So we, we follow, we follow what the zoning rules are. And part of what we do is that there were also half, we would also take a look at what, so somebody comes in, they say they're going to do something. And then we would take a look and ask them, okay, you're going to do this something.

So why don't you model it out and see what the actual impacts on the community would be? You know, so for instance, anyways, that, that would, that would, that would be the, that would be how we would move forward and look at it. So we're not, we're not saying at 660 feet, we're not worried about it.

We're asking for modeling so that we can review and take a look and see what impacts it would have on the community.

[Speaker 3] (1:38:52 - 1:38:53)
All right, Daniel.

[Speaker 12] (1:38:54 - 1:39:34)
Okay. All right. I, I don't understand the answer, but I'll accept it.

My last question here is related to warehousing and logistics. So I am, I'm really trying to understand the carve out for warehousing and logistics because frequently this has been, what's been brought up to me from outside of these areas is polluting impacts related to warehousing and logistics specifically. And so can someone explain why we would decide to make that carve out when we're hearing such concern from impacted communities related to these facilities?

[Speaker 3] (1:39:35 - 1:39:59)
Alderman LaSpada, I think Alderman Hadden asked the question just previously before you, I know you're trying to reiterate it, but this was answered by first, Alderman Garza and, and, and Alderman Thompson. So we gave examples. She wasn't satisfied with it, but this, this exact question was just asked about 15 minutes ago.

[Speaker 12] (1:39:59 - 1:40:35)
Well, my, my apologies then I, I will get a rehash from her and maybe I'll find a way to be satisfied because I'm not there yet. I, if I may ask one more question, so it was brought up that the administration and sponsors met with environmental groups, at least in passing, it was said some were in favor, some were against. I know again, Alderman Hadden asked a version of this question, but can someone share the groups that were in favor or the aspects of the ordinance that they were in favor of?

[Speaker 3] (1:40:36 - 1:41:01)
Somebody can opine, but I heard a long, long pause when Alderman Hadden asked the question. Yeah, me too. So any of the sponsors at all, otherwise we're going to move to Alderman Sitio Lopez.

All right. I guess that answers your question. It does.

It really does. Thank you. All right.

Alderman Sitio Lopez.

[Speaker 8] (1:41:02 - 1:41:40)
Thank you, Chairman. And thank you for this important conversation. And I think definitely concerning that we don't have any groups in support, especially when we originally had several community groups, environmental groups in support.

My question around the air pollution, especially as it relates to areas that are already community burdened by air pollution. Will these ordinance allowed increases in air pollution in areas that are already most community burdened by pollution? That's, that's the first question I have.

[Speaker 3] (1:41:40 - 1:41:47)
That would be Department of Public Health, I believe. Yep.

[Speaker 2] (1:41:47 - 1:42:08)
Can you hear me? We can. Yes.

Okay. Sorry. The goal is to mitigate.

So based on traffic studies, based on looking at what the companies that would be coming in would do, the goal would be to mitigate, to ensure that we're not in, to minimize as much as possible.

[Speaker 8] (1:42:11 - 1:43:03)
Right. And let me, let me just follow up then because certainly mitigation is not the same as control, right? Or reduction.

So it seems like this might be the case where increases still may be allowed. At what point does the threshold become harmful? At what point does the Department of Public Health denies?

I'm telling that because we do have communities where we have pollution in the top percentile for diesel emissions, for hazardous materials for asthma rates and so forth. Right. So at what point will be denial of permits in areas where air pollution is already harming the residents?

[Speaker 2] (1:43:05 - 1:45:07)
Our intent would be to provide information with regards to what, what those increases would be. So as far as the truck traffic, that all gets modeled together to make sure it does not impact the state implementation plan. I could defer to others on this call, but you know, is this would be the first step to take a look and actually understand what the impacts are across the city.

First and foremost, what's in those areas where there are health concerns. And so we want to make sure that if we're at a level that's, what level are we at and what are we really dealing with? Because again, often when things come in, especially on dirty property, people think the worst case, but we want to look at it and understand really what is that issue?

Where are we at and how can we mitigate it? And you know, there could be times in the future where we, you know, we look at when we have cumulative impact on and we look at all these things, we may make recommendations to, at least through my commissioner to the mayor and the chief sustainability officer that we are getting to the point where it is untenable. It's not something that is not appreciative or I'm not appreciative, but that's something that we can manage anymore.

So that's going to take a little bit more time to get to that point. But I think at least with this ordinance, we will be able to have a seat at the table to inform the zoning on the conditions of things and not just say, well, you know, it's, it's X, Y, Z. We're going to ask them to provide that information and engage with the alderman in their community.

[Speaker 8] (1:45:08 - 1:46:06)
Yeah. My follow-up question then goes in terms, and I think you, like you mentioned, Dave, around having a seat at the table. And as you mentioned, there are indeed communities and I do oversee a industrial corridor where we already have reached those on a table and attainable unsustainable levels.

My concern is that we are not, and again, alderman Beal, I think point out about the, the, the issue with the process. I don't see how these ordinance addresses the seat at the table. And this is going beyond the mayoral prerogative, aldermanic prerogative.

Where is the community prerogative in all this process? We know that there are communities that are burdened by cumulative effects. This, does it stop them or not?

Does this stops pollution? Does that stop the dirty industry? Yes or no?

[Speaker 3] (1:46:08 - 1:46:25)
And just Dave one word, because I know this question was asked in a different format, but passing this ordinance with will there, will our communities see an improvement in the air quality?

[Speaker 2] (1:46:26 - 1:46:27)
Yes, we believe so.

[Speaker 3] (1:46:29 - 1:46:33)
All right. See, Joe Byron. Next question.

[Speaker 8] (1:46:34 - 1:47:11)
Yes. So again, and I think that there, I think that there's a disconnect here between alleviating future development versus remediating the damage that's been done already. So there's a disconnect.

I think that there will be future projects where we may not be able to stop them. And the process does not allow that. My last question, my, you know, my next question is around current proposals that will be impacted by this ordinance.

And if so, if you can provide some examples, maybe the sponsors or the department of public health around a specific proposal that may be impacted, that you can be used with these ordinance.

[Speaker 3] (1:47:13 - 1:47:15)
Hi, Patrick Murphy.

[Speaker 1] (1:47:19 - 1:50:01)
Well, as a part, in regards to specific projects, it would be a large, current, current recycling facilities, for instance, or any type of industrial. If you can go back to my list, actually, if you go back to the chart, just talk through some of the different items that are, that are subject to this. So Alderman, the various intensive industrial uses that are listed on the left-hand side of the column, that's going to be up on the screen here shortly would be the, the, the, the full extent of what might be what might be, this might be applicable to, it would run the gamut of recycling type facilities, as well as a number of waste related facilities that some of which may not be operating in many of the wards or many of the PMDs, but all would be addressed on this going forward. There we go.

So Alderman on the, on the left-hand, the left-hand column, the recycling facilities, like I was talking with Alderman Hayden earlier about the different types that those, those entertain or those, those entail the container storage and the freight terminal container storage was not particularly what Alderman Dowell was asking about, but a freight terminal activity would be something that is, we're not changing the designations permitted or special use, depending on your zoning classification, but we are in all of these instances adding that site plan review criteria. And then as you get to the last, the last handful of intensive uses, you have intensive industrial uses, which are very specific to exclude things like food manufacturing and lower scale development of, of manufacturing parts and wood related products. And also, so you're dealing with concrete plants.

You're dealing with any type of petroleum based manufacturing process. And then finally the outdoor storage of raw material of which as a principal use. So currently we do not have any of those facilities operating in the city and we are not, we are not changing or diminishing any of the oversight for those as it relates to manganese and coal and issues that are very prevalent in Alderman Garza's ward.

The, the warehousing and wholesale, while it doesn't have the plan development trigger, and this was asked earlier, I believe by Alderman La Spada, all of these uses are subject to what we've never had before, which is this site plan review, which is very specific to what Dave was referring to and to what CDOT discussed before. So regardless of the legislative route that one of these projects could go through, they're all subject to far more strenuous criteria on the front end before any decision is made regarding zoning than any of these uses have been up to this point.

[Speaker 3] (1:50:04 - 1:50:12)
I think that you're going to use this as a model too Patrick, right? You've, you know, there were special use incinerators and mining. Correct.

[Speaker 1] (1:50:13 - 1:50:19)
Those, those are go, those, those use categories, those items are going away from the municipal code. Yes, sir.

[Speaker 8] (1:50:21 - 1:52:05)
Thank you. So I think that we heard a lot, you know, there is a very good questions, very good conversation. The reality is that we do have a lot of communities.

And are you looking at the map where it is clear that we, we deal, still in this day and age with serious issues of environmental racism, there is a disparity in terms of the air quality between neighborhoods in the city of Chicago. We need to move towards greener areas, greener technology. That's where the future is at.

That's where we're going to get sustainable growth for the city instead of getting stuck in the past. How do we move towards a, towards legislation where we can make sure that we have remediation where we have already done so much damage to all residential areas in black and brown communities? So how can we, as I mean, and I tell you, I tell you this because I have a cement plant right now that was approved despite reservations.

We have already a lot of, a lot of pollution in the industrial corridor that I oversee. And I don't believe that going to the circuit court will do any justice to our communities. So how are we going to make sure that we respect federal mandates where it is clear that community effects are just simply unattainable or unsustainable.

And we need to change course. This does not do justice for those federal mandates. And my last question is how are we going to stop more proposals for coming to industrial corridors when we have reached that limit as they've already mentioned?

[Speaker 3] (1:52:05 - 1:52:12)
Okay. Thank you, Byron. Who wants to tackle that question?

Patrick?

[Speaker 1] (1:52:13 - 1:53:29)
Sure. I can handle part of it. And I would also add that Kathy Dickett's here from our department to talk about some of the long range industrial planning efforts that the city is continuing that we'd already started in a number of PMDs and industrial corridors prior to this.

So Alderman, part of what Dave was speaking to earlier in regards to the cumulative effect is looking at not only the types of industries and the output that those industries have in a community now, but then also what the cumulative effect of new industries could be. And part of the recommendations that can come out of projects that are proposed is that while a use may be allowed in a particular area or in a particular corridor, it's intensity, the amount of trucks, the amount of acreage, the amount of output that it can, can qualify to administer might be reined in, might have to be reined in because of the environmental and the traffic oversight that we're getting on the front end of these projects now. So that is one of the clear benefits that is different to how we look at these projects today.

And that it's specifically designed to look at the cumulative effect on these different, on these different areas, these sensitive uses around these industrial corridors. If Kathy's available, she might be able to speak to some of the department's other longterm efforts to look at narrowing some of these community industrial areas down.

[Speaker 3] (1:53:30 - 1:53:45)
If Kathy's on there, she can be brief on it. We've got a couple more. There she is.

Kathy. Sorry, quickly. You heard this question about.

Yeah.

[Speaker 18] (1:53:45 - 1:54:19)
In general, what the Alderman is asking is like, why aren't we going to greener manufacturing? Are there greener practices? And that is the future.

I think even if you thought Bill Gates late lately talking about concrete and how that those kinds of things have to be, that's the next generation of improving carbon is improvements to how those things are made. So we will be looking at the industrial corridors on the Southwest side, which includes those in little village, Stephenson and on the far South, as Alderman Garza knows, we're getting ready to have those conversations in the beginning of the next quarter. So.

Okay. All right.

[Speaker 3] (1:54:21 - 1:54:23)
Can we move on? Thank you.

[Speaker 8] (1:54:24 - 1:54:25)
Thank you, chairman.

[Speaker 3] (1:54:25 - 1:54:53)
Okay. Alderman Michelle Smith. Alderman Smith.

All right. Well, I think then we will close with Alderman Cardenas. I'm here.

I'm here. Well, now you show up. Hi, Michelle.

Okay. Okay. Okay.

Okay. We get on mute and let's go.

[Speaker 6] (1:54:53 - 1:55:22)
Yeah, that's my number one problem. Okay. So here's, here is.

Okay. Wow. Sorry.

So I'm a little confused. About certain provisions of this ordinance. And I, and I, and I, and I do need some help.

So today, as we sit here today, The uses that are the subject of this ordinance are largely as of right. Is that, is that correct?

[Speaker 1] (1:55:23 - 1:55:28)
Patrick. No, I would say it's a smattering. If you could put back up that chart.

[Speaker 6] (1:55:28 - 1:55:28)
Yeah.

[Speaker 1] (1:55:28 - 1:55:54)
So Alderman, the chart is going to have the left-hand side column is all the uses that we're, we're impacting in this proposed ordinance. The middle column is going to highlight the variety of permitted and special use parameters. So if you look into the middle, there are certain special uses.

There are specific permitted by right categories in various M districts. As well as C districts when it deals with the warehousing. So it runs the gamut.

[Speaker 6] (1:55:54 - 1:56:27)
But in any event, in none of these situations today, is there a requirement that the. Or is today, I will not ask it in a leading way. If nothing happens and this ordinance fails and it doesn't pass.

I will ask it in a leading way. And that is in, are, are there any air requirements? Separate city air requirements that are over and above.

Federal and. Federal and state regulations. On these uses today.

[Speaker 3] (1:56:29 - 1:56:35)
So Dave, you want to answer that for the Alderman? No.

[Speaker 6] (1:56:36 - 1:59:19)
No. Now the city has passed very recently. Some new regulations as to recycling facilities.

Isn't that right, Dave? Yes. Yes.

And so that's, that's one step. But so today. I've been a little confused because.

You know, I used to work in the area of diesel air regulation and we help pass more stringent diesel rules. But we never had a municipality have much power over that. And so I guess what I want to understand is that if this doesn't, if this, if we just maintain the status quo, because we don't like this.

We kind of have to go back to the drawing board to a certain extent. It is kind of what I. What I'm gathering.

And the other question I have is. I'm also concerned about special uses plan developments as of right. Things like that.

I will tell you that one reason we have zoning codes. Is to separate out the uses. Now.

And that. Is a very positive thing because it didn't used to be that way. But my experience with special uses and PMDs.

Is that in all cases. If you really hate the outcome and you have a good lawyer. You know, you, you certainly can suit a circuit court.

So I guess one thing that I was concerned about is I got a letter today. Or. Either last night or today that said, we don't like this ordinance.

I got two letters. One that didn't like it because it's too not strict enough. And another because it's too strict.

But, but one of the ordinances. One of the letters I got today said. We don't like this because it takes away.

The legal right to protest the outcome. And I guess I just wanted to clear that up. If there was someone from the law department.

Who was on the line. To talk about the outcome. Of a.

Adverse decision in the zoning board appeals versus the adverse. An adverse decision in the. Plan commission or a city council decision.

You know, I've been on all sides of these issues. Okay.

[Speaker 3] (1:59:20 - 1:59:33)
So with that. Vicky, do you want to talk about or Patrick? To respond to that question.

I don't know if there's a question. About where Lisa, if she's around. Lisa Misher.

[Speaker 1] (1:59:34 - 2:01:24)
I. I could give a, well, I can give a. Response to Alderman Smith.

And then if Lisa or Vicky want to add in further. I would just say from, from two standpoints of what this ordinance is or is not proposing to do. So.

We are, first of all, we are not changing. Any of the authorities. Under the zoning board of appeals.

However, there are significant. Authorities that are being expanded. Through the plan commission as it relates to these intensive industrial uses.

And the site plan review criteria that's proposed in this ordinance. Is not only new authorities for the three departments that are here today. But it also clearly puts these recommendations at the front end of the process.

So. And provides a clear path for community members and Alderman that want to find out more about the project, whether they're for or against it. But possible objectors are not the same as an applicant.

And today in the municipal code under the zoning ordinances, there's not an appeal route. For a final decision on a zoning action by an opponent, unless it is proven that in the case of zoning, the zoning administrator erred in their application of the rules. So simply being.

That is a rule today. Yes, ma'am. Absolutely.

Right. But I bet I'm saying we're not diminishing that as a part of this ordinance. And there is not, there is not, there was not an attempt to dilute that type of authority going forward.

So if someone is opposed to a project, they do have a route to appeal just like they would today. That is not being changed as a part of this ordinance, but simply being opposed to the outcome is not always sufficient enough. To warrant the objection.

So I'll, I'll certainly let Vicki respond more. If she has more detail to add, but there is a difference between an applicant and an objector and there already is a very clear path for objectors to appeal.

[Speaker 6] (2:01:24 - 2:01:24)
Yes.

[Speaker 3] (2:01:25 - 2:01:33)
Okay. Let me see if Vicki or Lisa wants to. Because we all have been, have all been in that seat, right?

Michelle.

[Speaker 6] (2:01:34 - 2:02:00)
So that's why I, that's why I was confused by this letter. I have been on all sides of the zoning disputes, both before the zoning appeals and before the plan commission, I both didn't like the outcome of a plan commission vote and the outcome of a ZBA rule. And I didn't, and I liked the outcome at a ZBA.

I mean, as a private citizen, I know there are all cases a lawyer shows up and sues. So I didn't get, I don't understand the letter that I got today.

[Speaker 3] (2:02:00 - 2:02:13)
Well, the chairman is a non-lawyer is going to ask for Vicki or Lisa. If they wanted to add more to that, Lisa, you, are you there?

[Speaker 6] (2:02:14 - 2:02:57)
He's jumping on right now. Okay. Okay.

Okay. While she, while she's jumping up. So I, I guess some of my colleagues have and, or why a lot of groups have asked the question.

And I think that to the extent that I think we need to understand that automatic prerogative, of course cuts in many directions, right? I mean, it can an automatic prerogative can be used to try to stop something and can also be used to push something forward. And the community has less control over that.

[Speaker 3] (2:02:59 - 2:03:02)
So that came up and that was part of the substitute Michelle.

[Speaker 6] (2:03:03 - 2:03:18)
Right. So I'm just agreeing with that on behalf of the community, my neighbors, while everyone says, Oh, as an automatic prerogative, great. You're going to do what we want.

That's not always the case. At least it was on the call or the place to go.

[Speaker 3] (2:03:20 - 2:03:23)
Hi. Can you hear me? Yes, we can.

Lisa.

[Speaker 17] (2:03:24 - 2:03:24)
Great.

[Speaker 3] (2:03:25 - 2:03:28)
Did you hear Alderman Michelle Smith's question?

[Speaker 17] (2:03:29 - 2:03:29)
I'm sorry.

[Speaker 6] (2:03:30 - 2:03:37)
I didn't, I just jumped on. The question is if you are just, if you are a diss, a, a dissatisfied neighbor.

[Speaker 17] (2:03:37 - 2:03:38)
Yes.

[Speaker 6] (2:03:38 - 2:03:57)
Okay. And those are the cases that you defend. If you are a dissatisfied neighbor and you believe that the decision of the ZBA was wrong and an error, not just because I hate it, but because it's wrong.

Right. Can you, are there opportunities to bring a case in the circuit court of appeals?

[Speaker 17] (2:04:00 - 2:04:11)
Yes. There is the administrative review act that allows appeals of ZBA decisions. There's some, there's some question about standing, but, but yes.

[Speaker 6] (2:04:11 - 2:04:31)
We get through it all the time. Secondly, if you are dissatisfied with the outcome of a plan development that has gone to city council, that has gone to the plan commission and you can, and can you hire a lawyer and go to, and it's not just because you hate it. It's because you have grounds.

Can you go to court?

[Speaker 17] (2:04:33 - 2:05:01)
Yes. I mean, there are people who oppose legislative rezoning decisions and they can go to circuit court. Yes.

You have the same issues with kind of party standing. I mean, for example, for ZBA or rezoning decisions, you can't be someone who, for example, is located down the other side of the city who might not, you know, be affected in any way.

[Speaker 6] (2:05:01 - 2:06:32)
Yeah. I mean, I've been part of cases on all sides of this. So I have, that's why I have to say, I got a letter today that said we object to this because by changing in one draft of this ordinance, some of these were special uses.

And, and now some of those changes in the first draft were turned into something before the plan commission. And in some cases things that are currently special uses would now require some more interdepartmental review along with community meetings. Now, there are many aldermen who don't require a community meeting for a special use.

That's, they aren't. We do, we often do it in my neighborhood, but not everybody does it. So I guess I just am asking the question because I was unclear as to why that is a basis for an objection.

There might be other objections. That's not in my view, that's not one of them. And I guess in the other thing is, is that the other thing I just wanted to mention is what our friend from the Chicago department of public health, the city has never really tried to do this.

And so, and I'm getting letters from industry that says, we don't like this. It ties our hands. It's too quickly being worked on.

Those of us, those of you who've been working on it for months. So that's really all I have to say, which is that sometimes making progress is a really, really important thing. And this strikes me as being an awful lot of progress.

[Speaker 3] (2:06:33 - 2:06:41)
All right. Thank you. Thank you very much.

And to close, I'm going to ask alderman Cardenas, and then I'm going to ask for a motion. All right.

[Speaker 5] (2:06:43 - 2:10:03)
Thank you. Thank you, chair. You know, there's, there's a, there's a lot of obviously questions and, and folks who want one, the initial creators of the ordinance to speak on this, but let me just say this.

And I asked in those in opposition, do you prefer having no community involvement as it remains today? Do you prefer the city to continue the approach to land use planning and silos? Do you prefer polluting industries continue to operate and moving to communities without first consulting those very residents that are impacted without conducting traffic studies and having no regard to the environmental impact they cause?

How does this make sense? This is obviously a piece of the puzzle. You know, I get scolded by not doing enough and I've got letters just like many of you from industry saying we don't want this and from environmental organizations that it's not strong enough.

You know, although this is, this looks a lot different from, and not a lot different, but somewhat different from when I first proposed this will offer as much benefit and yield controls that don't exist today. You clearly see that. And that's what the beta is about.

I have proposed air monitoring in the past for those same industries, and they've been dismissed in the past as well by prior administrations. Here's my history. I've been here almost 20 years, chair of the environmental commission of room to allow committee for since 2011.

And I've dedicated much of my work in trying to strike a balance between environmental protection and economic development. And I've been criticized many times, no doubt, but in a city like Chicago, we must acknowledge that land use planning is unequivocally one of the most powerful determinants of sustainable and healthy communities. Around the same time last year, I introduced the zoning reform ordinance that inspired this very same one.

That ordinance sought to eliminate permitting by right, created a public engagement process and required a special use permit via CBA. This ordinance has since evolved, but one thing has remained and that is our desperate need of industry accountability, public involvement and cross departmental coordination to avoid unintended consequences from cumulative disadvantages of multiple small scale land use decisions. I'm optimistic that this reform being presented today will be far, will be fair and transparent in the process that precedes it.

This ordinance is a monumental piece of puzzle to improve air quality, address and address the air pollution that is proportionally harming communities of color to reinforce, reinforce unjust disparities in health and environmental quality. Alderman Sigchow talked about what industries can I mention? There's one that is in his ward, it's Ozinga is expanding operations into my ward.

If we don't pass this legislation, they can operate under the old rules and create more air pollution without any accountability. There's also Lacial Recycling who is expanding recycling operations and also Lacial Recycling material that is going to add particular matter to the air. If we don't do nothing, then my community, which is beset by air quality pollution and, and this equity will be even more impacted.

So I asked you those, those aldermen that talk about equity, where is your equity when it comes to my community? So please let's support this, let's move with, and I hopefully one of my members will move to a vote. Thank you.

All right. Thank you for that.

[Speaker 3] (2:10:03 - 2:10:04)
Vice chair.

[Speaker 5] (2:10:05 - 2:10:12)
Mr. Chairman, I moved that we take a vote on the matter before us using the quorum established roll call.

[Speaker 3] (2:10:13 - 2:10:29)
Okay. Okay. So we're going to the motion by Alderman to pass as amended will be done via the roll call.

All right. Let me get a sheet. We'll start with, we'll start with a vice chair.

[Speaker 10] (2:10:30 - 2:10:33)
I'm going to relay that motion on the table.

[Speaker 3] (2:10:33 - 2:10:38)
That motion's already the motion. I've already started the roll call. All right.

[Speaker 5] (2:10:39 - 2:10:40)
All right.

[Speaker 3] (2:10:41 - 2:10:42)

[Speaker 3] (2:11:28 - 2:11:31)
This is the motion to pass the amended ordinance on air quality.

[Speaker 20] (2:11:32 - 2:11:33)
Okay.

[Speaker 3] (2:11:33 - 2:11:36)
And we're doing a roll call and you're up.

Chairman, this is Alderman Wagesback. Did you have me as an aye or was that a.

[Speaker 3] (2:12:41 - 2:12:42)
Now I do.

[Speaker 4] (2:12:42 - 2:12:44)
Okay. Okay. Not sure what happened there.

[Speaker 3] (2:12:45 - 2:12:46)

Do I have a motion to adjourn?

[Speaker 5] (2:13:19 - 2:13:21)
So moved Chairman Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 3] (2:13:21 - 2:13:27)
Alderman Lopez moves to adjourn. Thank you. We'll see you at a regular zoning committee meeting.
