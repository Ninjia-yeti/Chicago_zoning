Welcome, Alderman.

[Speaker 22] (17:41 - 17:42)
Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (17:42 - 20:29)
Thank you. Thank you all. We will now move on to the approval of the Rule 45 report containing the minutes of the January hearing of the Committee on Zoning Landmarks and Building Standards.

Thank you. All members of the committee should have a copy of the report in their packets. Hearing no objection, Alderwoman Dowell makes a motion by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Hearing no objection, the report is approved. Moving on, I will now read the items to be deferred. I will read the page number, the file number, the address, and then take a motion for all at the end.

If no questions, by committee members. First map amendment on page 2, file number A8862 for the address commonly known as 1257-1301 North Ashland Avenue. Top of page 3, file A8856 for the address commonly known as 6244-50 West 63rd Street.

Moving all the way to page 14, the bottom two items, including item 22349 for the address commonly known as 1347 West Grand Avenue and 22323 for the address commonly known as 4301-4453 South Federal Street, 4300-4452 South Dearborn, and 4301-4453 South Dearborn.

Although La Spada makes a motion to defer the previously listed items by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum, hearing no objection, the items have been deferred.

At this time, we will begin the public comment period. The public comment period will be limited to 30 minutes. Out of respect for everyone's time, each speaker is limited to three minutes.

We have four public speakers signed up for today's hearing. We'll hear from them now. First up is Natasha Gray.

Natasha Gray, followed by Ward Miller, George Blakemore, and Francisca Rincon. Do you want to set yourselves up?

[Speaker 12] (20:31 - 23:12)
Good morning. Good morning. My name is Natasha Gray.

And I wasn't really sure about what I was going to speak about, but I do have a concern about the buildings in my neighborhood that are owned by a particular management company, Manage Chicago. He's opened up a corporate office at 71st and Yates. His previous location on West 119th mysteriously burnt down or is no longer in operation.

And he's self-admitted that he owns 15 buildings in the neighborhood, and they've been closed down, but now he's housing immigrants in them. He's been previously known to be a slum landlord by his previous tenants and by some of the neighboring proprietors. And my issue is that when we discovered that he had them in the building, he had a security door on the building, and it was boarded up, okay?

Obviously, he does not have permits for proper occupancy of his building. And that's just one that I know about specifically, that I witnessed what literally was going on in the building. And I'm just trying to figure out how is it that, you know, that he's allowed to operate in that manner, you know?

I understand that he's trying to be a humanitarian or whatever, but how is it that he's allowed to be a slumlord and have a CHA permit and not care for those that were in his buildings the way he should have, and now that he's allowed to house tens of people in a building, instead of having them overcrowded in the building, okay? And it's not in the condition that it's supposed to be in for them to be there. And so, I guess I wasn't really sure what I wanted to speak about, but that was an issue for me.

And I do not believe that immigrants should come before the citizens of Chicago, okay? I work with the public. I see homeless people all day, not just adults.

I see whole families out here in need, okay? There was just a single father that was found in Englewood. It was reported that he had his kids in a building, no heat, no water.

You all gave him a cell to sit in and put his kids in DCFS, but these newcomers, they're allowed to have their kids in whatever state that they have them in while you dish out whatever help you can give them. I'm coming here constantly to let you, to remind you all that you need to help the citizens of Chicago first, either they be white, black, Latino, or a legal immigrant from some other place. And that is all.

[Speaker 1] (23:13 - 23:28)
Great. Thank you, Ms. Gray. The staff person in the back, actually, is going to follow up on the building issues you have.

He'll connect with you directly. We don't have any items on today's agenda, but we'll follow up certainly on the building concern. Next up is Ward Miller from Preservation Chicago.

[Speaker 17] (23:28 - 25:27)
Hi. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. I'm Ward Miller. I'm the executive director of Preservation Chicago. We're here on a deferred item.

We just found out it was deferred, but it's item number 22324, 4041, 4015, and 4017 West Ogden Avenue and 2309 South Heeler. These are three amazing buildings on this site fronting Ogden Avenue, which is also, which is, as you know, also Route 66 in Chicago. It's about to celebrate its centennial in two years.

And these buildings that are significant, two of them are by Alfred Altshuler. There are numerous landmarks by this architect, and they're proposed to be demolished for a cross-truck dock. And we would ask and implore you to reconsider and defer this again, as you have, because this is essentially a demolition for a large truck facility that will also emit huge toxins into the community, and we're afraid that this is going to end up being another Crawford Power Plant situation, where we have a community that's seen a lot of disinvestment over time that's going to be impacted in numerous ways. So we would ask that this be deferred, which it has been, but we'd also want to consider these buildings for a suggestion for Chicago landmark designation, which we have made, and they will also be part of our Chicago 7 Most Endangered announcement on March 6th at the Chicago Architecture Center. These are three really important buildings by the Turner Company and the Western Felt Company, with amazing lineages to Chicago's industrial past, the stockyards, and our industrial might.

So we would ask that these buildings be considered for Chicago landmark designation, and this ordinance be rejected. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (25:28 - 25:29)
Thank you, Mr. Miller.

[Speaker 31] (25:30 - 25:31)
Up next is George Blakemore.

[Speaker 9] (25:37 - 26:29)
To the citizens of our great city, one of the most corrupt and racist cities in the United States, Michelle Harris has kept a black man who owns the Regal, one of our historical landmarks on 79th and Stony Island. Why would she do that? And then created another building with the same name.

Who would do that? And you, sir, that just finished speaking, you're for the Rich Treehouse Foundation. You're supposed to say, okay, but it's controlled and owned by Mr. Treehouse. Wait a minute. Yes, it is.

[Speaker 1] (26:30 - 26:30)
Mr. Blakemore.

[Speaker 9] (26:30 - 28:04)
All right. Anyway, I'm going to continue. I asked him a question about the Regal, and his answer was that the Altman didn't want to adopt the Regal.

That's what you told me. And she had created another Regal. That's illegal.

These are historical landmarks in our black neighborhood. Who does this? Why would she do this by the same name of the original Regal?

If I urge you all to adopt a landmark, the Regal Theater, and money has been set aside for that adoption, over $300,000, sir, so I think you should focus. Make that happen. Make your nonprofit organization, make that happen.

Right there, Estonia, Alice in 79. Don't pay her any attention. You're not supposed to hand it to the Altman.

You said you are independent of this. I made you aware of this, and I also asked you on your foundation, Preservation, whatever, Chicago, whatever, how many black staff. Your answer was, we have Hispanics.

I didn't ask you that question. Wait a minute. Mr. Blakehorn, Mr. Blakehorn, address your comments to the chair, please.

[Speaker 1] (28:04 - 28:05)
Mr. Blakehorn.

[Speaker 9] (28:05 - 28:41)
On your paid staff, leave me alone until my minutes are up. On your paid staff, I asked this question. The Federation called my black brothers and sisters in a racist city, in a corrupt city, in a city that's headed by Democrats.

Make it go red. Make it happen. Black people, when they're treating you like you're second or third class citizens, make it happen.

Mr. Blakehorn got a loud mouth and a big heart for black people. Why do you do this, Mr. Blakehorn? Because I'm black.

[Speaker 1] (28:42 - 28:56)
Man. Thank you, Mr. Blakehorn. Alderman Beal has joined us for a quorum.

Next up is Francisca Rincon, has Alderperson Fuentes for a quorum. Thank you. Proceed.

[Speaker 27] (28:56 - 29:06)
Good morning, everybody. I am here because I am not agreeing about the petition.

[Speaker 1] (29:07 - 29:10)
I'm sorry, Ms. Rincon, can you speak closer to the mic? I can't hear you.

[Speaker 27] (29:10 - 29:44)
Okay. Good morning, everybody. I am here because I am against the proposal, because the neighbor, in my opinion, the neighbor is paid right now, and there is not enough space to change that for a single family.

So the only thing that I have to say is that I am against it.

[Speaker 1] (29:51 - 30:41)
Great. Thank you, Ms. Rincon. We will now move on to the agenda.

The first item is document number 02024-0007343, the amendment of the Municipal Code, section 17-6-0403-F, by requiring special use approval for religious assembly permits for planned manufacturing district number 11, located in the 25th Ward. This item has a substitute that corrects some formatting issues, and at this time, I would ask for a motion to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Alderman LaSpada motions to accept the substitute.

Any objections? Hearing none, the substitute is before us. The item was introduced by Alderman Byron Ciccio-Lopez, who is here to testify and present on the matter.

[Speaker 31] (30:49 - 30:54)
I don't think we have a presentation on this, do we?

[Speaker 19] (31:08 - 32:33)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and yes, this is an amendment to allow a local constituent church to operate within an industrial site. We have discussed this with the Zoning Advisory Board, as well as the applicant, so the goal here is to allow the use for a place of worship that will also help and has been helping with youth support. This is going to be a facility that opens up after hours, so it required a special zoning amendment.

We discussed with the applicant making sure that we are not setting a bad precedent in terms of the zoning amendment. Again, we discussed with Patrick Murphy, who was helpful to make sure that we just create a special use so that we have a use in an industrial zone for a place of worship that has been working in the community, especially around youth support, as well as their worship services. So this is an amendment that has the support of the Zoning Advisory Board, our office, and of course, asking our colleagues for a favorable support of this item.

[Speaker 1] (32:34 - 32:37)
Thank you, Alderman. Any questions? Alderwoman Dowell?

[Speaker 30] (32:38 - 32:52)
Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Patrick, I heard what the Alderman said, in that this was specific to something happening in his ward. Can you speak to the impact it would have on others?

[Speaker 16] (32:54 - 33:23)
Hi, good morning, Patrick Murphy with the Department of Planning. Generally speaking, there will be no impact to any other planned manufacturing district. This is only in one subarea of one PMD.

And then as the Alderman said, it would be allowed as a special use. So the specifics about the actual operations, the quantity of individuals who will be there, the hours of operation, things of that nature will all be addressed in their ultimate application to the Zoning Board for a special use.

[Speaker 30] (33:23 - 33:32)
Okay, so this applies to the PMD ordinance that is specific to the 25th Ward?

[Speaker 16] (33:34 - 33:40)
No, specific to the PMD subarea. Go ahead.

[Speaker 30] (33:41 - 33:45)
Within his ward. Okay. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (33:45 - 36:24)
Great. Any other questions on that? Clear?

All right. Hearing none. All the women down was do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none. The ordinance is passed as amended.

Next are large signs over 100 square feet in area 24 feet above grade and we will hear them all together. I'll read the word followed by the address and then take a motion at the end. In the third Ward 1414 South Wabash Avenue in the 15th Ward 1418 West 47th Street, two signs in the 21st Ward located at 221 West 83rd Street in the 22nd Ward 3501 West 26th Street, four signs in the 25th Ward located at 2724 West 21st Street in the 27th Ward 904 West Fulton Market, two signs in the 27th Ward located at 362 West Chicago Avenue, four signs in the 27th Ward located at 1242 West Washington, also in the 27th Ward 362 West Chicago. We've got at least two, maybe three of those.

All right. Two signs in the 27th Ward located at 124 North Sangamon, two signs in the 27th Ward located at 1950 West Carroll Avenue, two signs in the 28th Ward located at 564 West Taylor Street, two signs in the 32nd Ward located at 1435 West Webster in the 45th 41st Ward 11601 West Tui Avenue, two signs in the 43rd Ward located at 658 West Belden, lastly three signs in the 46th Ward located at 4547 North Broadway.

If no questions by committee members, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? All the person Fuentes moves do pass. Any objection?

Hearing none, the orders are passed. We will now move on to the map amendments. In an effort to ensure the committee meeting runs as smoothly as possible, items are grouped together according to witness and will be heard in that order rather than in ward order.

All right. We're going to start in the 9th Ward. Number A, 8863, ordinance referred, 111523, common address, 146 West 127th Street.

Change request, a B31 community shopping district to RS2 residential single unit detached house district. We have Alderman Beal to speak on this item.

[Speaker 13] (36:25 - 36:32)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, this is an automatic zoning change for future land plan usage and request the committee's favorable support.

[Speaker 1] (36:33 - 37:20)
Great. Any questions by committee members? Hearing none, Alderman Conway moves do pass by the same vote that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed. Bottom page two, item number A, 8864 in the 11th Ward, ordinance referred, 111523, common address is 937 through 1021 West 31st Street.

Change request, RS1 residential single unit detached house district, B12 neighborhood shopping district, and B22 neighborhood mixed use district to B22 neighborhood mixed use district. In the 11th Ward, I don't see Alderman Lee. Oh, okay.

We'll come back to that then.

[Speaker 31] (37:21 - 37:33)
Okay, thanks. You're up. We're moving fast today.

[Speaker 1] (37:33 - 37:45)
Thanks. So, item number A, 8864, common address 937 to 1021 West 31st Street. We have Carlos Diaz from the 11th Ward office.

[Speaker 34] (37:45 - 38:02)
Thank you. 31st Street is a commercial corridor. These addresses are variously zoned.

We ask that you put your favorite consideration so that these zones can be uniform.

[Speaker 1] (38:04 - 38:45)
Great. Any questions? Hearing none, Alderman Ramirez, moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed. Thank you.

All right, moving on to the 19th Ward. Great. Document number A, 8859, 19th Ward, ordinance referred 11.1.23, a common address is 10.032 South Vincennes Avenue. Change request is RS3, residential single unit detached house district to RS2, residential single unit detached house district. We have from Alderman O'Shea's staff.

[Speaker 29] (38:46 - 38:46)
Kristen.

[Speaker 1] (38:47 - 38:48)
Kristen. Go ahead and proceed.

[Speaker 29] (38:48 - 39:25)
Good morning. Kristen Karnes is Angus from Alderman Matt O'Shea's staff. Good morning, Chairman and members of the committee.

Alderman O'Shea requests a favorable consideration for this plot of land. It's currently used as an urban farm of sorts from a local church, but it is being sold. And the Alderman O'Shea spoke with the neighboring residents and felt that to keep it consistent with the other zones in the area, he would like to reduce it from RS3 to RS2 to keep consistent with the density of the other homes.

[Speaker 36] (39:26 - 39:27)
Great.

[Speaker 1] (39:27 - 40:00)
Any questions by committee members? Hearing none, Alderman Knutson moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, the item is passed. Thank you. Next up, item number A, 8865 in the 21st Ward, ordinance referred 124.24. Common address, 10541 South Aberdeen Street. Change request, RS2, residential single unit detached house district to POS-1, parks and open space district. We have Alderman Ronnie Mosley.

[Speaker 15] (40:01 - 41:15)
Thank you, Mr. Chair, asking for favorable consideration. This is a parcel that is currently owned by CPS and is going to be transferred to the park district so that we can build the new Jackie Robinson Fieldhouse. We want to really integrate that park fieldhouse into the rest of the area.

This is, again, right borders or what would be a great, as I call it, a great gym in the crown of the Jackie Robinson campus. You have the park and the baseball stadium. You have Mount Vernon Elementary School as well.

This new fieldhouse is going to be 18,000 square feet. It's going to feature a gym. It's going to feature a team room, a fitness center, community rooms, and open land space for the community.

Really want to thank my state partners for the work here. Give a shout out to State Representative Justin Slaughter, who helped allocate $15 million to really bring this project to life. So asking for favorable consideration to the park for this zoning amendment and with your permission, we'll share the floor with representatives from the park district if there's anything else to add.

[Speaker 1] (41:16 - 41:31)
Sure. Thank you, Alderman. I wanted to recognize we have Jack George here, the attorney for the project, and Heather Gleason with the park district, both longtime friends of the body.

So welcome back to both of you. Did you want to say anything on top of that or just be ready for questions?

[Speaker 28] (41:32 - 42:06)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, Heather Gleason, I'm the director of planning for the Chicago Park District. So we thank very much Alderman Mosley for helping us through this process. We are very excited to be able to pick up this piece of property that CPS no longer needs.

We're working very closely with them and we are planning to build an 18,000 square foot field house with a full gym and fitness center, community rooms for the park, and then it's going to have a great open space that we can program for movies in the park or whatever else the community would like to hear. So we're just really excited to be able to bring this to the neighborhood. Great.

[Speaker 1] (42:07 - 42:10)
Great. Thank you. Questions?

Alderman LaSpada?

[Speaker 8] (42:12 - 42:26)
I got to ask to Alderman Mosley because I feel like I don't pay as much attention as I should. Clearly, to what's happening in the 21st Ward, is this the same project that we were discussing in the finance committee or are you just getting it done all over the place, sir?

[Speaker 15] (42:27 - 42:59)
I believe this is a new project. I did fail to mention that this is also home to the Jackie Robertson West team as well that uses the park district facilities there and to really help cultivate the sport of baseball and the culture that's there. The park district, after hearing comments from the community, went back and added in two drop nets in the baseball or in the gymnasium with a protective floor covering so that they can have that year-round practice to, again, bring a championship to the Southside.

[Speaker 8] (43:00 - 43:03)
That's really awesome. Congratulations. Thank you, too.

[Speaker 1] (43:04 - 43:13)
Any other questions? I have a couple, actually. You said you got $15 million from the state.

What's the total price tag on this?

[Speaker 28] (43:15 - 43:17)
So we will stay within that $15 million.

[Speaker 1] (43:18 - 43:25)
Okay. So then my next question is, since it's baseball, have any of our Major League Baseball partners come in with any heavy donations?

[Speaker 28] (43:25 - 43:28)
Not yet, but we'll work on that together.

[Speaker 1] (43:29 - 44:40)
And I want to say congratulations to my colleague because it sounds like a great project. Any other questions by committee members? Hearing none, Alderman Harris moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed. Congratulations.

Thank you both. Good to see you. Now, next up, item number 22326 of the Ninth Ward.

Ordinance referred, 12424. Common address, 11301 to 11363 South Corliss Avenue, 11333 South Doty Avenue, and 701 East 114th Street. Am I saying that wrong?

I am. All right. 11301 to 11363 South Corliss.

Thank you, Alderman. 11336 South Doty and 701 East 114th Street. Change request.

C23, Motor Vehicle-Related Commercial District, C15, Neighborhood Commercial District, and M33, Heavy Industry District, to C23, Motor Vehicle-Related Commercial District, and then to a Business Plan Development. We have Paul Shadle here to speak.

[Speaker 20] (44:41 - 45:17)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman, committee members. Yes, Paul Shadle with DLA Piper, representing the Applicant Pullman Gateway LLC, which is a joint venture between Chicago Neighborhood Initiatives and the Hope Center Foundation of Chicago. And I'm joined this morning by Jennifer Bransfield, who's the General Counsel at CNI, on behalf of the applicant.

The matter was considered at a public hearing before the Plan Commission last Thursday, the 15th of February, and the Commission recommended approval. If the committee hasn't done so already, I was a little late, I would ask that the record of proceedings from that hearing be incorporated into the record.

[Speaker 1] (45:18 - 45:31)
Correct. Alderman Dowell so moves that the records findings from the hearing, by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum and the objections, hearing none, the records are incorporated. Please proceed.

[Speaker 20] (45:31 - 46:27)
Sure. The site is approximately 8.8 acres, it's at the south of the intersection of Doty and Corliss, west of the Bishop Ford Expressway, on the south side of 111th Street. The site, as you noted, Chair, is currently zoned C-15, C-23, and M-33, and the proposal is to rezone it to C-23 and then to plan development, and this would allow the development of the overall site that's surrounded by that red boundary.

In phases with commercial and retail uses, the first phase of development at the north end is a Chick-fil-A restaurant with a drive-thru facility, the CTA will occupy the existing building on an interim basis as the project offices for the red line. That's really all that's before you today, Jen and I are both here to answer any questions that you may have, and I believe Alderman Beal may also have something to add.

[Speaker 1] (46:28 - 46:36)
Great, thank you. Alderman Beal, did you want to add anything, or we can go to questions? Any questions for the applicant, or for the Alderman?

Alderman Spada?

[Speaker 31] (46:40 - 46:41)
Use the mic.

[Speaker 8] (46:42 - 46:56)
Hi, microphone. Did this go before the Planning Commission last meeting? Ah, unfortunate absence for me, just wanted to be clear.

Felt like I would have remembered it. Dig it. Thank you so much.

Thank you, Chair.

[Speaker 13] (46:57 - 49:21)
Thank you. Any other questions? Alderman Beal?

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. This is a wonderful project that we are really excited about on the far south side of Chicago. This is the first Chick-fil-A on the far south side, and we're excited that this is just another feather in the cap to all the amenities that we have brought to this particular area, such as, of course, you all know it started with the Walmart, the Planet Fitness, the Ross, and Amazon, the Women's Community Center, and, I mean, the list just goes on and on.

And this year, we're looking to break ground within 30 to 45 days on this Chick-fil-A, as well as the first 102-room Hampton Inn, which is another hotel that will be a first on the far south side in the last 40, 45 years. And, you know, this particular area is really the next phase of development that we are undertaking, and having CNI as a lead partner with the Hope Foundation, and, of course, our partners over at DLA Piper, who always does a phenomenal job with expediting these particular type of plans. But I just wanted to raise some concerns, that one concern that I have, but I've already talked to DLA, because of the way this plot survey kind of went through, the address is 113th and Doty, but it's actually off of 111th Street.

So I just wanted to make sure that we flagged that, that when the fire department issues the correct address, that it does not reflect 113th, because they'll be going to the wrong location, because it's right off of 111th. So I just wanted to make sure we put that on the record as well, because that struck me as kind of odd that this whole development had 113th Street address on it. But again, we're excited about it, and having Chick-fil-A, you know, I invite everybody down to have some of that wonderful chicken, and we're going to twist their arms, because we have a community of churches in the area, and the fact that they don't sell chicken on Sunday poses a huge problem to the church families on the far south side.

But again, I wish, you know, your fabled support on this particular project.

[Speaker 1] (49:22 - 50:26)
Thank you, Alderman Beal, good luck on Sunday. They're by Brinkley Field, and there's still no Sunday, right? I know, I want to congratulate you and the team, I know the work that you've put into this entire area, north of 111th, the historic Pullman district in this area south.

Thank you for hosting us earlier, or last year was a great tour. If you haven't been there, I think he'll probably, he'll take you on a tour of that area whenever you want, probably. He's very proud of it, and he should be.

No other questions? Then Alderman Conway makes a motion to pass as revised for the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, this is passed as revised. Thank you very much. All right, top of page four, in the 11th ward, item number 22341-T1, ordinance referred 12424, common address 500 West 26th Street.

The change request is an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to B23 neighborhood mixed-use district. We have Tom Pekarsky.

[Speaker 23] (50:26 - 51:40)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. I am Tom Pekarsky of the law firm of Gordon and Pekarsky on behalf of the applicant, Henry Tam. We're before you seeking a type one amendment of the city of Chicago zoning map from the current RS3 to that of a B23 for the property commonly known as 500 West 26th Street.

The subject is a vacant lot measuring 61.5 by 125.25 feet and located at the northwest corner of the intersection of 26th and Normal. The site was previously improved with a raised three-story building and used for heavy commercial and residential uses. The applicant proposes to construct a four-story building providing 14 residential dwelling units and 14 parking spaces.

We have reviewed our plans with Alderman Lee and appeared before an extensive community process. No objections have been voiced to the present project. In fact, it's a collaboration with the Alderman's office in the community in drawing this final proposal.

And Alderman Lee has issued her support of the project in the form of a letter previously provided to the chairman. Therefore, we ask the committee to vote its recommendation of passage of the application to the full city council.

[Speaker 1] (51:41 - 51:55)
Great. Thank you. We do have a letter of support for Alderman Lee.

Any questions by committee members? Hearing none, Alderman Beal makes the motion to pass by the same roll call the vote. It was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

[Speaker 23] (51:55 - 51:55)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (51:55 - 52:18)
Thank you. Staying in the 11th ward, item number 22342-T1. Ordinance referred 12424.

Common address is 1642 West 38th Place. Change requests. An RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district.

We have Jimena Castro.

[Speaker 4] (52:19 - 52:21)
Hello. Good morning.

[Speaker 1] (52:21 - 52:21)
Good morning.

[Speaker 4] (52:23 - 53:36)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Jimena Castro. I'm a zoning attorney at Acosta-Escar.

Here today on behalf of the applicants for the property located at 1642 West 38th Place. The property is located in an RT4 zoning district and is improved with a residential building with two dwelling units. We seek to rezone the property to RT4 under a Type 1 application to reduce the required rear yard open space, front, west, and combined setbacks under Section 1713.1100 to allow a subdivision of the subject property with 1644, which is the lot right next to it, so that the owners at 1644 may construct a single-family home on the vacant lot. We went through a community process. We have aldermanic support, and we also have a number of lovely letters from the neighbors that were supplied to the committee to show the neighbors' support for the rezoning. We'd like to ask your favorable consideration, please.

[Speaker 1] (53:38 - 54:15)
Great. Any questions by committee members? Hearing none, all the women crews moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed. Next up is next door.

Item number 22343 in the 11th Ward. Ordinance referred 12424. Common address is 1644 West 38th Place.

Change request. An RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district. To RS3, residential single-unit detached house district.

We have, once again, Jimena Castro.

[Speaker 4] (54:15 - 54:50)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. For the record, my name is Jimena Castro. I am a zoning attorney at Acosta Esker.

Here today, representing the applicants for the property located at 1644 West 38th Place. The property is an RT phone-zoned property and is a vacant lot. We seek to rezone the property to an RS3 to construct a single-family home.

We also underwent an aldermanic community process. We have aldermanic support and letters of support as well from the neighbors. We'd like to ask for favorable consideration for this item, please.

[Speaker 1] (54:50 - 55:07)
Great. Thank you. Any questions by committee members on this item?

I just wanted to point out, this is actually the second item on our agenda. The first was the 1st and 11th Ward that's taking advantage of the Type 1 ordinance that we passed late last year, where they're able to put their variance request.

[Speaker 36] (55:07 - 55:07)
Is this the first one?

[Speaker 1] (55:10 - 55:14)
It's actually number two, Jimena. Sorry. You'll be number one.

[Speaker 4] (55:14 - 55:14)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (55:15 - 55:29)
She gets the balloons, though. So this avoids the ZBA for those projects that require zoning change and review by this committee. As we promised when we passed that, we're cutting time for large developments.

So congratulations, Jimena, on that.

[Speaker 4] (55:29 - 55:38)
Thank you. And thank you to all the other people that are present here that took place, did their duty by the people in Chicago.

[Speaker 1] (55:38 - 56:51)
Thank you. Thank you. More to come, I think.

Any other questions on this one? Hearing none, Alderman Laspada moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Hearing no objection, this item is passed.

Thank you. Thank you. A couple more for you.

Item number 22. Oh, I'm sorry. Top of page five.

Item number 22345-T1 in the 25th Ward. Ordinance referred 12424. Common address is 2308 West 18th Place.

Change request is an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to B25 neighborhood mixed-use district. Other person, Jesse Fuentes, makes a motion to defer the previously read item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, the item is deferred. Now to the middle of page five. Item number 22339 in the 45th Ward.

Ordinance referred 12424. Common address is 5123 West Montrose Avenue. Change request.

RS3 residential single-unit detached house district to B23 neighborhood mixed-use district. Once again, we have Jimena Castro.

[Speaker 4] (56:52 - 57:34)
For the record, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, my name is Jimena Castro. I am a zoning attorney at Acosta-Esger, here today representing the applicant for the property located at 5123 West Montrose Avenue. The property is an RS3 zoned lot.

Improved with the residential building with ground floor commercial use and residential use at the rear of the building. The commercial units are vacant and have been for some time, and their legal non-conforming status has expired. Therefore, we seek to rezone the property to a B21 to allow the commercial use of the property.

We have Aldermanic support, which was applied to the committee, and we seek a favorable consideration.

[Speaker 1] (57:34 - 57:55)
I believe I misspoke in that. The change request is an RS3 residential single-unit detached house district to B21 neighborhood mixed-use district. We do have the letter of support from Alderman Gardner.

There was feedback also in your packet from some folks that did not support. Any questions for the witness? Alderman LaSpada?

[Speaker 8] (57:55 - 58:18)
There we go. Less for the witness, Chair, than for Zoning Administrator Murphy, because I don't know that I've read this phrase before while serving on the committee. Their legal non-conforming status has expired.

Can you talk more about what legal non-conforming status means and how that operates?

[Speaker 16] (58:18 - 59:08)
Zoning Administrator? Yes, hi. Patrick Murphy, Department of Planning and Development.

So, in many zoning districts, there are uses that exist that, in many cases, predated the zoning that's on the property. So, here at commercial occupancy, a commercial use that's in a residential zoning district. If you maintain the commercial use, you maintain your license, you continue running the shop, whatever it might have been, you can continue operating as a non-conformity.

At such time that you let that expire for a period of more than 18 months, you lose the ability to reoccupy that space either with a similar tenant or to sell the business to another operator. All those allowances go away. And then, in this case, you would either need to rezone the property to reestablish it or you would have to cease doing whatever those operations were.

You could not restart them.

[Speaker 8] (59:09 - 59:14)
Duly noted. I noticed a lot of those spots. Great.

Helpful to understand it.

[Speaker 16] (59:14 - 59:16)
Yeah, they're quite prevalent.

[Speaker 8] (59:16 - 59:17)
Thank you very much. Thank you, sir.

[Speaker 1] (59:18 - 59:24)
You're going to see another one in the 44th ward in a little bit. Stay tuned, Alderman. Any other questions on this one?

Alderman Conway.

[Speaker 32] (59:26 - 59:40)
You know, when somebody takes the time to really write a letter of opposition, I like to sort of dig in there a little bit. I guess the question would be, do we know what the use is planned to be for this and anything else in the letter I'd like to respond to?

[Speaker 4] (59:42 - 59:57)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Alderman. At this time, the owner of the property, she's actively trying to find a tenant and support, you know, herself as the sole owner.

[Speaker 1] (59:59 - 1:00:04)
Maybe the zoning administrator. B-2 is the lowest intensity business use, right?

[Speaker 16] (1:00:04 - 1:00:27)
It's the same as B-1, right? Yes. Patrick Murphy again, Department of Planning.

Yes, it's the second lowest business or commercial use classification. So it would have the most pressing limitations you would probably find are prohibitions on outdoor uses, prohibitions related to liquor, and the classification of restaurants not being, you know, taverns and general restaurants. So relatively low intensity.

[Speaker 32] (1:00:28 - 1:00:35)
Fair enough. There seemed to be some implication here that this was something else was going on, so I thought I would ask that. Thank you.

Nothing further, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:00:35 - 1:00:37)
Anyone else? Alderman Dow. Yes.

[Speaker 30] (1:00:38 - 1:00:47)
Yes, thank you. So my question, too, came from the letter of opposition. Does the applicant have any existing building code violations?

[Speaker 4] (1:00:48 - 1:00:49)
Not that I'm aware of.

[Speaker 30] (1:00:50 - 1:00:51)
Patrick, do you know?

[Speaker 16] (1:00:52 - 1:00:54)
Patrick Murphy, no, not that I'm aware of either, Alderman.

[Speaker 30] (1:00:55 - 1:00:55)
Okay, thank you.

[Speaker 16] (1:00:56 - 1:00:57)
Thanks.

[Speaker 1] (1:00:57 - 1:01:03)
Any other questions on this one? Hearing none. Oh, Alderman Cruz.

[Speaker 21] (1:01:04 - 1:01:16)
Also going based on the letter of opposition, were there any community meeting, any input from the community regarding this project, and what was the majority of the feedback?

[Speaker 4] (1:01:16 - 1:01:47)
Thank you, Alderman. We met with the alderman and his staff, and they, I believe, put out a notice for the community to give input, and the alderman deemed the property and the rezoning as good candidates for the rezoning. So we did have an opposition, but I think the activation of vacant storefronts was important to the alderman.

[Speaker 21] (1:01:48 - 1:01:57)
And the outreach was just sent through your office with the letter that we, you know, after, you know, around three months of heat. Was that the only letter to?

[Speaker 4] (1:01:57 - 1:02:01)
The alderman took care of all communication with his board. Okay.

[Speaker 21] (1:02:02 - 1:02:21)
And then following up with what Alderman Dahl said about, according to this opposition letter, there have been seven complaints filed against this address. And at least with one building code violation. Can we get clarification on this?

I thought we said there was no code.

[Speaker 16] (1:02:23 - 1:02:41)
So Patrick Murphy again from the Department of Planning. So our department does not oversee building code violations. I would not have readily available access to that.

We can follow up with the Department of Buildings, but I'm not aware of anything that has been raised through our department related to this building. If there are building code violations, it possibly is through the Department of Buildings, but I would not readily have information on that.

[Speaker 31] (1:02:48 - 1:02:52)
So I think I'm just looking at the complaint letter.

[Speaker 1] (1:02:53 - 1:03:14)
It looks like there were old violations from four years ago. The dates on these are May of 2019. And they failed a field inspection in 2020.

Not a whole lot of info. Do we know if there's been work done to correct any violations or any work done in the last few years?

[Speaker 4] (1:03:14 - 1:03:15)
I am unaware.

[Speaker 1] (1:03:15 - 1:03:20)
Okay. Or is there any work done planned with the zoning change? Or is it simply to legalize the?

[Speaker 4] (1:03:20 - 1:03:23)
Just to legalize the storefronts.

[Speaker 1] (1:03:23 - 1:03:55)
Okay. Which is not uncommon. I think when we did the zoning code 20 years ago, the whole block was R, so it went R4.

And the one in my ward you're going to see is a storefront we're allowing to use again. B2 does allow for both residential and commercial on the first floor, which is the other unique category here. Which is another thing we see a lot of.

So, you know, I think. What's the will of the body here? We want to get a little more info?

Or we want to? Sure. I'm sorry.

Yes.

[Speaker 8] (1:03:55 - 1:04:33)
I was just going to note, because we don't always have these up on the map in front of us. But pulling it out on my phone, it may technically and truly be non-conforming. But when you look at it, there's multifamily housing just next door.

And you're practically only 400, 500 feet away from Milwaukee Avenue. Yes. Which is a really thriving commercial corridor.

So while it is technically non-conforming, I don't think it is so out of the way from adjacent commercial for this not to be a reasonable change for us to be considering. In my opinion.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:33 - 1:04:52)
Right. So hold that thought, Alderman. We're going to hold this for the time being and reach out to the building department if that's okay.

So sit tight on that. I know we've got more to do. More cases with Jimena anyway.

So we're going to hold item number 22339 in the 45th ward and come back with a little bit more info.

[Speaker 4] (1:04:52 - 1:04:52)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:52 - 1:04:53)
All right. Thank you. All right.

[Speaker 4] (1:04:53 - 1:04:55)
And my colleague, Rolando.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:55 - 1:04:56)
Oh, I'm sorry. Rolando has.

[Speaker 4] (1:04:57 - 1:04:59)
The Willard Court. Okay, great. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:59 - 1:05:19)
Thanks. Item number 22311-21 in the 27th ward. Ordinance referred 12-13-23.

Common address is 723 North Willard Court. Change request is an RS-3 residential single unit detached house district to B-2-3 neighborhood mixed-use district. We have Rolando Acosta.

[Speaker 2] (1:05:20 - 1:06:06)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant. The proposal is to rezone the property from RS-3 to a B-2-3.

Property is currently improved with a two-unit residence, no parking. Originally was filed to go to a four-unit residence and have an addition on top. After meeting with the community and the aldermen, we have submitted a substitute set of narrative and plans because we are reducing the request to three units and no rooftop addition, no dormer.

Based on that, we had the support of the community. I believe we have the support of the aldermen. This is a short lot because part of the lot is taken by the Kennedy Expressway, which sits at its immediate rear.

[Speaker 1] (1:06:09 - 1:06:30)
Great, quiet neighbor. Alderperson Fuentes moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the Type 1 application by the same roll call that was used to determine form. Any objections?

Hearing none, the substitute narrative and plans are accepted. Any questions by committee members? Vice Mayor Burnett, did you want to add anything on this?

Three units?

[Speaker 11] (1:06:32 - 1:07:09)
Sure, thank you, Mr. Chairman. As the Council has said, he met with the community organization, which in this case is the Echo Park Community Council. They approved it, but the adjacent neighbors had a challenge with it.

We had a meeting with the adjacent neighbor and the proposed developer, and they made some changes to their development to satisfy the adjacent neighbor. Then we had a community meeting with the rest of the community, and they all approved this project. We ask for the committee's support also.

[Speaker 1] (1:07:10 - 1:07:21)
Any other questions? Hearing none, Alderman Mosley moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

The item is passed as revised.

[Speaker 2] (1:07:22 - 1:07:22)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:07:23 - 1:08:02)
As substituted. All right, thank you. Top of page 6 is item number 22348 in the 21st Ward, ordinance referred 12424.

Common address is 1350-52 West 112th Street. Chains request is an RS-2 residential single unit detached house district to RT-4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district. To present, we have Attorney Nick Fitikas.

I also will add Alderman Hall is here for purposes of quorum. Mr. Fitikas.

[Speaker 22] (1:08:03 - 1:08:36)
Thank you, Chairman. Again, for the record, Nick Fitikas. I am here on behalf of the applicant and property owner, Sanju Sharma.

The current conditions of the property, it's a 6,240-square-foot lot, 50 by approximately 124.81 feet, currently vacant. And we are proposing a zoning change to develop the property with two new two-unit residential buildings. We did meet with Alderman Mosley and obtained a letter of support, which has been submitted to your file.

And I'm here to answer any questions your committee members have about our project.

[Speaker 1] (1:08:36 - 1:08:39)
Great. Thank you. Alderman Mosley, did you want to add anything on this?

[Speaker 15] (1:08:40 - 1:09:13)
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I would love to add that, you know, the 21st Ward is home to a lot of single-family home properties. This is an opportunity to present something that increased the multifamily, giving rental opportunities to residents in the ward.

And also, I talked to the developer about exploring options of where this could be something that is an intergenerational household as well. So, proud to have more and more developments like this in the 21st Ward.

[Speaker 1] (1:09:13 - 1:09:26)
Great. Great. Any other questions by committee members?

Hearing none, Alderman Ramirez moves due pass by the same roll call that was used to determine form. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

[Speaker 22] (1:09:26 - 1:09:27)
Thank you, sir.

[Speaker 1] (1:09:27 - 1:09:32)
Thank you. Next up is item number 22331.

[Speaker 22] (1:09:33 - 1:09:36)
Do you have something else? I do have one more on the top of page 8.

[Speaker 1] (1:09:37 - 1:09:39)
Okay. Sorry. Sit tight.

[Speaker 36] (1:09:40 - 1:09:40)
Top of page 8.

[Speaker 1] (1:09:40 - 1:10:03)
Top of page 8. Gotcha. Item number 22335 in the 27th Ward.

Ordinance referred 12424. Common address is 1052-58 North Central Park. Change request is an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district.

We have, once again, Nick Fitikas.

[Speaker 22] (1:10:04 - 1:10:48)
Thank you again, Nick Fitikas, for the record. I am here on behalf of the applicant and property owner, Yanga Development, LLC. The subject property at 1052-58 North Central Park is a vacant lot.

It contains about 9,200 square feet of total lot area. And the plan is to divide the lot into three development lots and have three three-unit residential buildings. Each building would have off-street parking for three cars.

We did review the application or the project with Alderman Burnett. We also received a letter of support from the West Humboldt Park Development Council. And I believe Alderman Burnett is here, but he had also confirmed support prior to today's meeting.

[Speaker 1] (1:10:48 - 1:10:53)
Great. Alderman Burnett, do you want to add anything on 1052 North Central Park?

[Speaker 11] (1:10:53 - 1:11:16)
Yeah. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As the Councilor said, he did meet with the local community organization, which is the West Humboldt Park Development Council.

Then we also had a community meeting. There was questions asked and some things asked by the community. The proposed developer is here to all of them.

So the community supported it. We asked for the committee's support also.

[Speaker 1] (1:11:16 - 1:11:51)
Great. Thank you, Vice Mayor. Any other questions by committee members?

Hearing none, Alderman Knutson moves due pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Thank you. Next up, we're going back to the middle of page six. Item number 22331 in the 36th Ward.

Ordinance referred 12424. Common address is 2534 West Cortez Street. Change request is an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to RM5 residential multi-unit district.

We have Attorney Tom Moore.

[Speaker 5] (1:11:52 - 1:13:05)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name, for the record, is Tom Moore. And this is an existing six-flat.

However, the city records only show it as a five-flat. There's a basement apartment that the purpose of this is to legalize it. We had extensive discussions with the Alderman's office and the neighbors.

And recorded a covenant that would make that basement unit affordable at 60% of AMI for 20 years. And a number of other accommodations to the neighbors involving parking and garbage and other things. And that was recorded.

And the Alderman's office had input into all the ingredients of the covenant. And upon recording of that, the Alderman has now supported the legalization of this sixth unit in this existing building. And so we have the Alderman's support.

And we request your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (1:13:05 - 1:13:11)
Great. Thank you. We do have a letter of support for Alderman Villegas.

Questions? Alderman Espada?

[Speaker 8] (1:13:12 - 1:13:16)
Two very quick questions. Tom, I'm just so curious. Who's the party to the covenant?

[Speaker 5] (1:13:18 - 1:14:04)
So it's the, you know, the covenant was recorded against the property by the 100% owner. The language in it allows anyone who feels aggrieved that it's not being followed to bring an action to enforce it. And they get attorney's fees if they're right.

So it, you know, I know it's not the, if there were more than nine units, we'd want to have the formal process. But for these type of situations, it adds an affordable unit and everyone's good faith. And there is a mechanism to enforce.

[Speaker 8] (1:14:05 - 1:14:12)
I dig it. I appreciate the context. Only other question, which one of the units are they going to be serving spaghetti out of?

[Speaker 5] (1:14:13 - 1:14:17)
I don't know how they came up with the name, but it's just a name, I think.

[Speaker 8] (1:14:17 - 1:14:18)
That's all right. Thank you, sir.

[Speaker 1] (1:14:18 - 1:14:53)
That's an interesting LLC name, certainly. For someone who doesn't serve food. All right.

Any other questions by committee members? Hearing none. All the minutes bottom was to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine forum.

Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed. All right.

Next up. Item number 22330 in the 44th Ward ordinance referred 12424. Common address is 3054 North Sheffield Avenue.

Change request. RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to be 2-2 neighborhood mixed-use district. Once again, Tom Moore.

[Speaker 5] (1:14:53 - 1:15:06)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. This is the situation which you were referring to before, where many, many years ago, back, I think Bernie Hanson was the alderman.

[Speaker 31] (1:15:06 - 1:15:37)
One second. Proceed.

[Speaker 5] (1:15:38 - 1:16:44)
Back in the 90s, this has always been a commercial, ground floor commercial. Most of the time it was a cleaner's. And the cleaner's left a year or so ago.

And so the property owner is unable to get a tenant that can be licensed because it's R4. And it was made R4 in some sort of general redoing of that area of the ward. I think the community leader said in 2004, 2005.

And so we had two community meetings. And the community group voted unanimously to support the B22, which would allow either a commercial or if he's unable to rent it as a commercial, he'd have to get plans and permits to transfer it to become residential. But the B2 would allow that.

And so we have the community support. We hope we have the alderman's support. We'd ask for your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (1:16:44 - 1:18:05)
Thank you, Mr. Moore. I'll just add, you know, we did one of the first 20 years ago when I was new in the 44th ward office, we did a wide scale rezoning that conformed to the new zoning code. And we have found a few old commercial units that got stuck in our zones like this over the years.

Most of them have had tenants long term. Some of them have gone residential or been redeveloped. But we certainly want to give folks options to preserve existing buildings.

So I still have them go to the community group. I still have them explain the request. There's really no change to the building.

So this better matches what is actually there. Any other questions on this one? Hearing none, alderman Beal moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine forum.

Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed. Great.

We'll go to the top of page seven. Item number 22313 in the 32nd ward. Ordinance referred 121323.

Common address is 2158, I'm sorry, 2154 through 58 West Wellington Avenue. Change request is an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RT3.5 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district. We have attorney Thomas Moore.

I understand there's an amendment here to a type one.

[Speaker 5] (1:18:05 - 1:18:31)
Preliminarily, yes, I'd ask that we be allowed to make it a type one. And this will be the third one that takes advantage of being able to meld the variances into the type one. And there was extensive meetings with the community and with the alderman approving all those.

So they have been vetted by the community.

[Speaker 1] (1:18:33 - 1:18:54)
Great. Jimena Castro is far more excited than you are. The first series of these, I'll just say, Tom, she's more exciting.

Well, maybe, maybe that's true. Any questions by committee members on this one? All right.

Hearing none. Alderperson Fuentes moves to pass as amended. Any objections?

Hearing none, the item is passed as amended.

[Speaker 5] (1:18:54 - 1:19:07)
Initially, weren't we doing the narrative and plans, the amended narrative and plans preliminarily? Because this was filed as a just a regular zoning case.

[Speaker 1] (1:19:08 - 1:19:44)
So the amendment to type one covers us for narrative and plans. Yes. So by calling out type one passes amended to type one as type one.

So we're good. OK, great. Thank you.

Thank you. All right. We have a second.

All in favor. Item number 22329, ordinance referred 12424, common address is 305 North Ogden. Change request.

M23, Light Industry District to DS5, Downtown Service District. We have attorney Edward Cuss.

[Speaker 14] (1:19:49 - 1:20:31)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning, Chairman Lawson and members of the committee. My name is Ed Cuss with the Taft Law Firm located at 111 East 14th Street, Los Angeles.

East Wacker in Chicago. I'm pleased to be here this morning on behalf of 333 Folding Company, LLC, which is an affiliate of Blue Plate Catering Company. Joining me this morning and sitting to my right is Mr. Jim Horan, the CEO of Blue Plate Catering. First, Mr. Chairman, this matter is a rezoning within an industrial corridor, and it was reviewed and approved by the Chicago Plan Commission on February 15, 2024. I would ask that the record of proceedings from the February 15, 2024 Plan Commission meeting be incorporated into today's hearing.

[Speaker 1] (1:20:32 - 1:20:43)
Sure. Alderman Cruz makes a motion to incorporate all records and findings from the Plan Commission hearing by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, the records are incorporated.

[Speaker 14] (1:20:44 - 1:22:29)
Thank you. The subject property consists of approximately 45,511 square feet, and it's located at the northeast corner of North Ogden Avenue and West Fulton Street. The property is an existing three-story building, which was constructed in approximately 2015, and from which Blue Plate Catering operates its catering business, along with accessory office and retail uses within the facility.

Blue Plate Catering is a longtime West Loop business that has served the Chicago market for over 40 years. It opened its first kitchen in 1983, and today is among the top catering companies in Chicago. The applicant is requesting a rezoning from the current M2-3 Light Industry District to the DS-5 Downtown Service District to allow for expanded business uses and the addition of a roof deck to the existing building.

The rezoning is needed to provide greater flexibility for allowable space for office, retail, food and beverage service, meeting space, and to allow the future rooftop space. Today, under the M2-3, it could not get licensed for those particular uses. The three-story building will remain as is.

There will be interior renovations to the existing third floor and completion of the roof deck. Blue Plate currently employs up to 500 people during its busiest months, and the proposed project will create 45 new temporary jobs and approximately 43 new permanent jobs. The applicant has met with community groups in the area, including neighbors of West Loop, West Central Association, and ICNC, the Industrial Council of Corridor Council.

This concludes our presentation. We are available to answer any questions, and we kindly request your favorable consideration. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:22:30 - 1:22:33)
Great, thank you. Vice Mayor Burnett, anything to add?

[Speaker 11] (1:22:33 - 1:23:14)
Yes, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. So they get sort of caught in this quagmire. When this was a PMD, they were not able to do a rooftop, right?

Since then, this property had been taken out of the PMD, but in order for them to be able to utilize their rooftop, they had to change the zoning. We did speak with all three of the community organizations. We asked for their opinion on this.

All three of the community organizations saw fit to allow them to be able to utilize this space and didn't see that we needed to have a community meeting about it. So with that, with each of those three community organizations' support, I ask for the committee's support also. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:23:14 - 1:24:02)
Great, any questions by committee members? Seeing none, Mr. Horan, thank you for continuing to invest in our city. 40 years is a long time.

I think we've all had your lunch at one point or another, and we'll all have it on the roof deck. So best of luck with the work. Alderman Vespada moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed as revised. Thank you.

Bottom of page seven is item number 22333. In the 32nd Ward, ordinance referred 12424. Common address is 3146 North Lincoln Avenue.

Change request is a B13 Neighborhood Shopping District to C13 Commercial Neighborhood District. We have attorney Sylvia Micas.

[Speaker 18] (1:24:03 - 1:25:48)
Good morning, Vice Chair Lawson and members of the committee. My name is Sylvia Micas. I'm an attorney with the law firm of Taft, Stettinius, and Hollister.

I, along with my co-counsel Ed Kuss, represent the applicant Marta Wozniak. Here with me today is the applicant Marta Wozniak, to my right, who is the president and secretary of Painless Waxing Incorporated. The subject property is located at 3146 North Lincoln Avenue, and is improved with an existing three-story mixed-use building containing commercial space at grade, and two dwelling units above.

The applicant has operated painless waxing located within the existing ground floor commercial space for the last 10 years. Due to market demand, the applicant is seeking to expand its personal services operation to include hair and nail services and microblading of body art services. In order to proceed forward with the proposed expansion of services, the applicant is seeking a zoning amendment to rezone the property from the existing B13 district to a C13 district.

The applicant has discussed its plans with Alderman Scott Wagesback and the South Lakeview neighbors. At the alderman's request, a restrictive covenant has been executed, which states that once the applicant secures the necessary licenses for the additional personal services, the applicant will file a zoning amendment to return the subject property back to its original B1-3 district. We have a letter of no objection from Alderman Wagesback, which I believe he has shared with the committee, and that concludes our presentation.

[Speaker 1] (1:25:49 - 1:26:37)
Great, thank you. We do have the letter from Alderman Wagesback. Any questions by committee members?

Hearing none, Alderperson Fuentes moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Best of luck with the expansion. Thank you. Thank you.

We did this at the top of page eight. So we're now in the middle of page eight. Item number 22350-T1 in the 28th Ward.

Ordinance referred 12424. Common address is 801 through 809 Southwestern Avenue, 2349 through 59 West Polk Street. Change request, C22, motor vehicle related commercial district to B3-3 community shopping district.

The attorney, Liz Butler.

[Speaker 7] (1:26:38 - 1:30:11)
Thank you, Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Liz Butler. I'm a partner with the law firm of Taft, Stettinius, and Hollister, located at 111 East Wacker Drive in Chicago.

I represent the applicant in this matter, Four Corners, LLC. I'm joined today by J.P. Bartley on behalf of the applicant and Ben Kennedy of Kennedy Mann, who is the project architect. The applicant is requesting a rezoning of the property located at 801 Southwestern Avenue from the C22 motor vehicle related commercial district to the B3-3 community shopping district to allow the construction of a five-story mixed use building with 36 dwelling units, 18 vehicular parking spaces, 36 bicycle parking spaces, and 2,915 square feet of ground floor commercial space.

The site contains approximately 10,331 square feet in net site area and is currently improved with a surface parking lot. The site is bounded by West Polk Street on the north, a 16 foot wide public alley on the east, a four-story mixed use commercial and residential building on the south and Western Avenue to the west. Western Avenue at this location is characterized by a mix of commercial and residential uses.

The change request to the B3-3 district is necessary to permit the five-story residential building with 36 units and to receive the enhancements that are available under the connected communities ordinance for projects that are in transit serve locations and that set aside 20% of residential units as affordable units. This project sets aside 20% of units or seven units as affordable. The property is a transit serve location based on its proximity to Western Avenue, the bus line corridor and Western Congress CTA station.

The project will meet all of the criteria for new construction and transit serve locations, including complying with the design standards for pedestrian streets, foregoing new curb cuts in favor of using the alley for vehicular access and providing one bicycle parking space per dwelling unit. As authorized by the recently amended type one zoning map amendment procedures, the applicant is also seeking a reduction in the required rear setback for floors containing dwelling units from 30 feet to zero feet and to reduce its required off-street loading from one space to zero spaces. And those forms of relief are necessary because this is a short lot.

Instead of 125 feet, we have a 108 foot lot depth as a result of the widening of Western Avenue. The applicant discussed the proposal with Alderman Irvin. We met with him several times throughout the fall.

We also met with the Tri-Taylor Community Association a number of times and a number of design enhancements were made to the project as a result of both the Alderman's input and community input. We understand that the Alderman is in support of the change. The Tri-Taylor Community Association is in support of the change request.

And we understand that that support was communicated to the committee in advance of this meeting. Our team is available to answer any questions that the committee might have. And we thank you for your consideration of this matter and respectfully request your favorable recommendation of the change.

[Speaker 1] (1:30:11 - 1:30:35)
Great, thank you, Ms. Butler. Thank you for pointing out that this is another development taking advantage of our new ordinance. Any questions by committee members on this one?

I did speak to Alderman Irvin and he did relate his support for this. There's no questions. Alderwoman Cruz moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Hearing no objections, this item is passed. Thank you.

[Speaker 4] (1:30:35 - 1:30:35)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:30:36 - 1:31:26)
We're gonna defer this next item, item number 22303 T1 in the 35th Ward, ordinance referred 1213-23, common address is 3652 to 3658 West Wrightwood Avenue. Alderman Conway makes a motion to defer the previously read item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, that item is deferred. All right, top of page nine, item number 22334-T1 in the 30th Ward, ordinance referred 124-24, common address is 3339 North Ridgeway Avenue. Change request is RS3, residential single unit detached house district to RT3.5, residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district. We have attorney Agnes Plekka.

[Speaker 3] (1:31:27 - 1:33:06)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My name is Agnes Plekka. I'm an attorney with the office of Joplin Berlin LLC, and I'm here to represent 39 Wentworth LLC.

And the proposed rezoning is from the existing RS3 district to a proposed RT3.5. And very simply, this is a double lot, 50 feet of frontage along Ridgeway. And currently it's improved with a three and a half story multi-unit residential building, which is non-conforming under the existing ordinance. The existing building is functionally obsolete, but not just that.

It's actually structurally unstable and just very simply economically not viable to rehab. So the owner proposes to redevelop the subject property with a new building on the double lot with five dwelling units, but only two story high maximum of 25 feet. We need this proposed zoning change in order to comply with the minimum lot area for dwelling unit.

And in terms of the height and the FAR and all the setbacks, we are strictly complying with the existing RS3 zoning district. And we have worked very closely with Alderwoman Cruz and her wonderful staff. We had a very well attended, well advertised community meeting.

We worked very closely with the adjacent neighbors. We did some revisions to the plans. We agreed to submit this as an elective type one, which we did.

And we are proceeding on the plans that we submitted without any revision. So with that, we're hoping that Alderwoman Cruz is still supporting us and we ask respectfully for your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (1:33:06 - 1:33:09)
Great. Do we have a substitute narrative and plans on this?

[Speaker 3] (1:33:09 - 1:33:10)
There was no substitute.

[Speaker 1] (1:33:10 - 1:33:11)
Okay, so by no...

[Speaker 3] (1:33:12 - 1:33:19)
Correct. We were submitting... Yeah, no revisions.

We were proceeding on the originally filed plans and narrative.

[Speaker 1] (1:33:20 - 1:33:21)
Alderwoman Cruz.

[Speaker 21] (1:33:22 - 1:33:50)
I wanna say thank you to Agnes. Definitely she was highly involved with the community, listening to their concerns. The changes came from the community input as well.

So Agnes was always respectful and willing to listen to our residents. And again, that's why there were some changes that were made even to become an RT 3.5. So I support this project and thank you for your partnership. Thank you so much.

[Speaker 1] (1:33:50 - 1:34:01)
Great, thank you both. Any questions by committee members? Seeing none, Alderman Hall moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, this item is passed.

[Speaker 3] (1:34:02 - 1:34:02)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:34:02 - 1:34:27)
Next up is item number 22298-T1 in the 27th ward. Ordinance referred 11.1.23. Sorry, yes. Common address 1701 to 1709 West Grand Avenue.

Change request C21 motor vehicle related district to B23 neighborhood mixed use district. Again, Agnes Blecka.

[Speaker 3] (1:34:27 - 1:34:54)
Thank you, sir. Again, for the record, Agnes Blecka. And I represent Grand Development Ventures LLC.

And first things first, this is a type one rezoning. And since we filed the original applications, we actually amended our type one narrative and plans to include this optional wonderful, wonderful relief that we are now authorized to do. If anybody is keeping the count, this is the fifth one.

So it's almost like an anniversary.

[Speaker 36] (1:34:54 - 1:34:55)
Sorry, fair point.

[Speaker 3] (1:34:56 - 1:35:03)
So we did submit revised plans and type one narrative to Department of Planning, and we are asking to proceed on those revised plans.

[Speaker 1] (1:35:04 - 1:35:16)
Because we're so excited all the Melesponimos to accept the substitute narrative plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the substitute narrative and plans are accepted.

Proceed.

[Speaker 3] (1:35:16 - 1:37:43)
Thank you, sir. So the subject property has a unique location. We are at the southwest corner of West Grand Avenue and North Paulina Street.

We also have a West Ferdinand Street along the rear property line. The property is currently a vacant lot, but it's a very short lot. It's only 85 feet deep.

So the applicant is proposing to develop the subject property with a new four story building, mixed use building with commercial unit on the ground floor, approximately 1600 square feet of commercial space and nine dwelling units with nine parking spaces within the attached garage. We need this proposed rezoning in order to comply with minimum lot area per unit and also maximum floor area per ratio requirements of the ordinance. This redevelopment is in compliance with the Chicago Grand Neighborhood Community Zoning Guidelines.

We met with the community. We went through the very extensive and very helpful ultimate DUNETS process. And we also had a large community meeting and everybody seemed to be in support of the project.

Since this is a transit served location and it's located within the Ashland Avenue Bus Corridor and Lake Street CTA Station, the project has been designed to comply with the criteria for transit served location, except for the optional relief that I'm gonna describe right now. So number one, we are seeking administrative adjustment to allow one-to-one parking ratio. So the criteria for the transit served locations ask for only half of what's required.

We are asking that for this particular location, we would be allowed to have one-to-one parking ratio. And then we also are asking for administrative adjustment to allow for reduction in the amount of transferred window area for the commercial space. Since we are not a pedestrian street, we are still providing nice windows.

However, they're not quite for the strict requirements of the ordinance. And finally, number three, because we have this short substandard lot, we are asking for variation to reduce the required 30 feet for the floors containing dwelling units to 12 inches proposed in order to have a better design building with better, more functional units. So we're hoping for your support.

We're hoping that Alderman Burnett continues to support us as I'm sure he will say his sentiments right now.

[Speaker 1] (1:37:43 - 1:37:46)
Great. Vice Mayor Burnett, anything you wanted to add?

[Speaker 11] (1:37:46 - 1:38:12)
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. The councilor pretty much said it all. She did meet with me.

She met with the Chicago Grand Avenue community organization. We had a community meeting. There were a few concerns, one in particular from the people across the street from the property.

They seemed to satisfy their concerns. Everyone supported. I supported.

[Speaker 31] (1:38:12 - 1:38:18)
I asked for the committee support. Thank you. Great.

Thank you, Vice Mayor. Any questions by the committee members? Alderman Espada?

[Speaker 8] (1:38:19 - 1:38:24)
Thank you, Chair. Agnes, could you explain the variances again that are being sought? Right.

[Speaker 3] (1:38:24 - 1:39:30)
So there's only one variance and two administrative adjustments. So the variation, and I can give you all the citations. I actually written them down.

So the optional relief under section 17-13-0303D for variation from section 17-3-0405A to reduce the minimum required the rear setback, which is 30 feet in a B district or floors which contains dwelling units. So that's the requirement. And we're proposing to do 12 inches because in the rear, we have that Ferdinand Street.

So there is still plenty of separation and we still provide plenty of light and vent and air to the adjacent properties. So that's the one variation. And then we have two administrative adjustments.

Number one, to allow us to have parking one-to-one. So we have nine dwelling units and we're asking to have nine parking spaces. Whereas the current requirement under the transit served criteria locations would be to have only half of what's required.

[Speaker 8] (1:39:31 - 1:39:37)
So the developer wants an adjustment and you have more parking spaces required?

[Speaker 3] (1:39:38 - 1:39:41)
Yes. One-to-one ratio.

[Speaker 8] (1:39:42 - 1:39:45)
Okay. And could you explain again about the windows?

[Speaker 3] (1:39:45 - 1:40:00)
Yes. So again, the same section of the ordinance is asking that the building complies with certain criteria for pedestrian streets. So for example...

One second.

[Speaker 8] (1:40:02 - 1:40:12)
I don't know if this was expressed in the meeting, but they're actually reconstructing Grand Avenue along that stretch to actually be more pedestrian friendly and oriented.

[Speaker 3] (1:40:12 - 1:41:01)
And we are pedestrian friendly. So because we have this unique location, we have frontage on three streets. We have Grand, we have Polina and we have Ferdinand, which even though it's a street, it's actually treated as an alley because that's where everybody has pedestrian access.

So we are actually providing huge windows on the Grand Avenue side, even on the Polina side, but we're not able to provide windows on Ferdinand because we need our vehicular access. So again, this is not strictly complying with that criteria, but we are definitely complying with the spirit of the ordinance, because again, we still have commercial use on the ground floor. We're still providing beautiful display windows on both sides of the elevation.

Okay.

[Speaker 8] (1:41:02 - 1:41:05)
That is helpful, Clarity. I appreciate it. Thank you, sir.

Thank you, too.

[Speaker 1] (1:41:06 - 1:41:16)
Thank you. I just have one other question, specifically on the one-to-one parking. What's the size of the units here?

Sort of your unit mix. I find that the bigger the unit, the greater the parking need, particularly in my work.

[Speaker 3] (1:41:16 - 1:41:44)
We have four bedroom units. So we have large, large family friendly units. So we're just kind of trying to, it's a balancing out.

Obviously it's a transit stop location, but very often families would have at least one car. So we don't want this car to end up on the streets and in front of anybody's home. We want to give them an opportunity to have that parking space in case the family needs it.

[Speaker 1] (1:41:44 - 1:41:47)
Sure. No, it makes sense. If it's all studios, you probably don't need one.

[Speaker 3] (1:41:47 - 1:41:48)
Yes, correct. Yeah.

[Speaker 1] (1:41:48 - 1:42:03)
All right, great. Any other questions by committee members? Hearing none, all the person's point has moved to pass.

But the same rule call that was used to determine forum. Any objections? Hearing none.

The substitute narrative and plans are passed as revised.

[Speaker 3] (1:42:04 - 1:42:06)
Thank you, sir. Thank you Alderman Burnett and members of the committee.

[Speaker 1] (1:42:07 - 1:42:30)
Yep. Bottom of page nine is document number 22346-T1 in the 30th ward ordinance referred 12424. Common address is 5416 through 24 West Belmont Avenue.

Change request is B23 neighborhood mixed use district to B23 neighborhood mixed use district. We have Rolando Acosta.

[Speaker 2] (1:42:30 - 1:43:56)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant. This matter involves a, it's really an amendment to a prior type one that was approved to allow for a 13 unit building.

It's a three story building. It was going to have one unit at grade and then 12 units on the upper floor. The balance of the upgrade space was going to be a commercial spaces.

When we were going through the ARO provisions of this, we needed to provide three affordable units, but it was the preference to also provide them to be ADA compliant. So we had two options. We could either get a, since this building has no elevator, there was no way to make the upper floors ADA compliant.

So the option was to either amend or get a variation of the ARO to not have ADA units. But since ADA units, ADA ARO units are particularly scarce. The other option was to add units on the ground floor and have all three ADA ARO units on the ground floor.

So we chose the second option, converting two commercial spaces to residential. Because of that, we increased our unit count to 15 units instead of 13. And that necessitated the proposed rezoning.

We will retain the 13 parking spaces that we have. This is transit served location. And just by frame of reference, the property and its zoning would support 40 units.

So we are not even close to pushing the envelope here.

[Speaker 1] (1:43:59 - 1:44:01)
All the women crews, did you want to add anything on this?

[Speaker 21] (1:44:03 - 1:44:17)
I just want to say that thanks to Rolando Costa and the owner for coming back and saying, you know that we're going to do with the ADA apartments and bring in three affordable houses, units to the area. So thank you for coming back and doing that.

[Speaker 1] (1:44:19 - 1:44:58)
Great. Thank you. Any other questions by committee members?

Hearing none, Alderman Conway moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine form. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Top of page 10, item number 22340-T1 and the 36th ward ordinance referred 12424. Common address is 2103 West Grace Street. Change request is an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to RM5 residential multi-unit district.

Once again, Rolando Acosta.

[Speaker 2] (1:44:59 - 1:46:09)
Good morning again, Rolando Acosta on behalf of the applicant. This involves a three unit building, a three flat on a short lot, it's a 90 foot deep lot that was previously vacant and was subject to some building code violations. The immediate next door neighbor purchased the property and wished to correct the violations and improve the property, then discovered that the back porch was originally an open porch, was enclosed and as a result, there was no not sufficient FAR on the property for the rear porch.

We also have the unique condition here that the lowest level, what we would all call the basement is actually more than half above grade. So it counts as FAR. So with the short lot, the rear porch, we actually needed the RM5 to basically meet the FAR and be able to reestablish the rear porch.

They are adding a roof deck. So it will extend to the roof deck, the rear addition and this will make the unit conforming. We had a community meeting, only one person attended which was the other neighbor who was supportive.

And with that, I believe we have the support of Alderman Villegas. I received the letters this morning. I don't know if your staff has received them, but okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:46:09 - 1:46:54)
We do have Alderman Villegas' letter. Any questions by committee members on this item? Seeing none, Alderman Knutson moves do pass by the same roll call that was determined, used to determine quorum and objections.

Hearing none, the item is passed. I wanna add Alderman Ramirez-Rosa for purposes of quorum and Alderman O'Shea as a visitor. Thank you both.

Middle of page 10 is item number 22347-T1 in the 49th ward. Ordinance referred 12424. Common address is 6540 North Glenwood Avenue.

Change request is an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to RM6.5 residential multi-unit district. Once again, Rolando Acosta.

[Speaker 2] (1:46:56 - 1:47:49)
Once again, Rolando Acosta on behalf of the applicant. This building was built in the 1920s. It was what I'll call an original transit served location building because it was built with 33 units really close to the Loyola stop and no parking.

There's a series of buildings like this one on the block. The building when the current owner acquired it had 38 units, then there was a fire. When he went to seek a permit to correct damage from the fire, it was discovered that of the 38 units, 33 were legal, five were not.

They were all in the basement. The proposed rezoning is merely to allow the reestablishment of those five units in the basement to turn this building into a 38 unit transit served location building. We had a community meeting, neighbors were supportive.

Alderwoman Haddon is supportive. I asked for the committee support.

[Speaker 1] (1:47:49 - 1:48:06)
Great, so we do have the letter from Alderwoman Haddon. I'm familiar with this block. I used to live around the corner when I was a Loyola sophomore.

I was shocked that it was R3 actually, pretty low. Any questions by committee members? I understand this is another one that we're doing a type one.

[Speaker 2] (1:48:06 - 1:48:12)
So we don't have the- We are doing a type one and there's no substitute. It was originally filed this way.

[Speaker 1] (1:48:12 - 1:48:22)
What variances or adjustments are you asking for? We're gonna call these out just so you know, we're gonna call these out on our agendas going forward so we have a better sense of that. But since it's new, remind us Philando.

[Speaker 2] (1:48:22 - 1:48:50)
Sure, to reduce the parking from five to zero for the reasons for effort stated of it being close to the train station. Also rear yard open spaces. We stayed within the residential districts.

There is no rear yard open spaces. This building is built virtually to the rear property line. I believe those are the only, and to reduce, yeah, reduce rear yard open space and reduce the parking from five to zero are the only two.

[Speaker 1] (1:48:50 - 1:49:23)
Right, thank you. Seeing no questions, Alderman Ramirez-Rosa moves due pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, the item is passed. Bottom of page 10 is item number 22223. In the first ward, ordinance referred 62123.

Common address is 2714 West St. Helen Street. Change requests, RS3, residential single unit detached house district to RM4.5, residential multi-unit district. We have Rolando Acosta.

[Speaker 2] (1:49:24 - 1:50:42)
Once again, Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant. The property, this is another short lot on a very short street, West St. Helen. Only has about three structures that actually sit on the street itself.

It is improved with a three-story building. Again, here the opposite is occurring. The basement is really low below grade.

So they wanted to add a unit or expand the units into the basement. But in order to provide enough light and air, we actually have to raise the building, which will then add some square footage to the building. They're also proposing a coach house in the rear.

So the building will rise for about four feet. Alderman La Spada is very, very strong on retaining existing buildings. So rather than demolishing it, we figured out a way to retain it, just raise it up in the air.

So the ultimate proposal will be to have three units in the front building, a coach house, a rear garage with two parking spaces. There's currently no parking on the property and a coach house under the ADU provisions of the ordinance on the top. Here we're again asking under the type one from some variations.

This was amended. It was originally filed without being a type one. It was amended to a type one or we seek to amend it to a type one and then take advantage of the variation provisions.

[Speaker 1] (1:50:43 - 1:50:55)
We'll go ahead and do that now. Alderman Beal moves to amend the application to a type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum and the objections. Hearing none, the item is amended to a type one application.

Go ahead and then go through those.

[Speaker 2] (1:50:56 - 1:51:43)
There's three variations that are sought. The first is on the Northeast. This is an angled street.

So Northeast side yard, reducing it to zero only because we are, the property, the building is currently on that property line. So as we raise it, the wall will expand on that property line and we need that. The combined side yard would then reduce from a requirement of five feet to three feet.

The other side of the property has the required three feet on that side. The second is to reduce the rear setback from 31.8 feet to 22.33 feet. Again, short lot accounts for that request.

And then the last one is to reduce the rear yard open space because once we build the garage with the ADU on the short lot, there will not be enough room to have the required rear yard open space.

[Speaker 1] (1:51:44 - 1:51:47)
Great, thank you. Alderman LaSpada, I was worried you weren't going to get back in time.

[Speaker 8] (1:51:50 - 1:52:38)
I'm on my phone, we're on Helen Street as well, correct? St. Alex. No, I really appreciate it.

I appreciate Mr. Arcosta and his team being really willing to work with our office. It is sometimes a struggle in Logan Square to do these kinds of adaptive reuses, to find creative ways to add ADUs, but I respect how they've worked with our community process. The feedback we've gotten from our residents has been neutral to positive.

A couple of small exceptions, but to see like a four foot increase over what RS-3 would be, is not so substantial of a height increase. And so I'm really glad for the project, for the collaboration, and hopeful my colleagues favorable consideration.

[Speaker 1] (1:52:39 - 1:53:17)
Great, thank you. Any questions by committee members? Hearing none, Alderman Knudsen moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, item is passed as amended to type one. Thank you.

Rolando's in the hot seat. You got a few more. Top of page 11 is item number 22344 in the 36th ward.

Ordinance referred 12424. Common address is 830 North California Avenue. Change request is a C12 Neighborhood Commercial District to B23 Neighborhood Mixed Use District.

We have attorney Rolando Acosta.

[Speaker 2] (1:53:18 - 1:54:19)
Rolando Acosta on behalf of the applicant. The subject property was being improved with a four story building containing three units above the ground floor, ground floor, commercial, rear, and three parking spaces in the rear. This is a portion of California that is a mix of residential and commercial on the ground floor.

The three properties immediately to the north are all residential, two flats. And so the owner has had difficulty finding any commercial tenants for the ground floor. This is transit served to Chicago Avenue, which is about a half a block south of the property.

So he wishes to add, to convert the ground floor from a commercial space to a residential space. In order to do that, we needed to secure the B2 zoning as opposed to the C1 zoning and the B, the dash three so that we could get sufficient unit count to add the one unit. We've discussed this with Alderman Villegas, who I know sent a letter of support to receive the copy.

I'm happy to answer any questions the committee may have.

[Speaker 1] (1:54:19 - 1:54:59)
Thank you. We do have a letter from Alderman Villegas. Any questions by committee members?

Seeing none, Vice Mayor Burnett moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, this item is passed.

Finally, item number 22321-T1 in the 40th Ward. Ordinance referred 121323. Common address is 5023-35 North Lincoln Avenue and 2441-53 West Winnemac Avenue.

The change request is B23 Neighborhood Mixed Use District to B23 Neighborhood Mixed Use District. And for the final time, I think, Rolando Acosta.

[Speaker 2] (1:55:02 - 1:56:08)
Pleasure to be here so many times. It's the rare event, but again, Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant. This project actually is in my neighborhood.

It involves a parcel of land where construction started about four years ago. The developer unfortunately passed away. The bank took over the property and the neighborhood has tolerated what has been a hole in the ground with a partial foundation for four years.

My current client purchased the property. The current alderman, Alderman DeVasquez, did not want the 12 units established there, but wanted greater density. Also, that would yield some affordable housing units for the project.

So he requested that we modify the project to be a 47-unit building that would yield nine affordable units. And because we are a transit-served location to the Brown Line stop at Western, as well as the Western Avenue bus, as well as the Lincoln Avenue bus, seek a reduction in the parking to 15 spaces. For that purpose, we have to rezone the property.

He says there's a substitute narrative and plans here that I would ask the committee to consider.

[Speaker 1] (1:56:10 - 1:56:23)
Yes, Alderman Cruz moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the substitute narrative and plans are accepted, continue.

[Speaker 2] (1:56:23 - 1:58:59)
So this building will have along the corner, there will be 1,200 square feet of ground floor commercial space. The Winnemac frontage sits on the corner of Winnemac and Lincoln. It is an angled lot.

So the awkward property lines here. Along the Winnemac frontage, there will be three work-live units, which are part of our 47-unit count. So that keeps a residential flavor to the Winnemac frontage.

The parking garage has frontage on Lincoln. Difficult to put windows in a parking garage, or at least they're not very functional. The alderman is trying to establish an arts district along Lincoln Avenue.

So instead of windows, we are placing a mural along that frontage. The consistent with the desired arts district. There are six either administrative adjustments or variations that are requested with connection with this, taking full advantage of the new ordinance and taking you through those really quickly.

Rear yard setback variation from 30 feet to five feet because of the angled nature of the property and the size of the proposed building. Reducing the parking for the transit served location provisions to provide only 15 parking spaces for the proposed 47 units. The variation to reduce the at-grade transparency, similar to what Agnes was talking about in her case, here along Lincoln Avenue, we will not have the required transparency.

We will have a mural in lieu of that. And then we have the setback of the facade from Winnemac. This is a sawtooth design.

So the points on the sawtooth will be within five feet of the property line, but the depth, the deeper portion of that sawtooth will be beyond the five feet. Hence that requires an administrative adjustment. In this case would be a variation because there's so many of them.

And then the height of the penthouse to 75.6 feet instead of 75 feet, we don't quite meet the setbacks in the ordinance for a penthouse on a corner property. And lastly, the distance of the penthouse from the side lot line, again, for the same reason Winnemac's running, well, Winnemac's running straight East West, but Lincoln is running at an angle causing a problem. That's a lot.

We had a community meeting. Community meeting ran about 70% favorable. Hence that led to the Alderman Vasquez's support.

I know he's indicated his support to the committee.

[Speaker 1] (1:58:59 - 1:59:42)
We do have a letter. We do have a letter from Alderman Vasquez. Any questions from committee members on this one?

Did I hear you mention a Lincoln Avenue bus? Yeah, it's on the list. You still have that up there?

We have it for a short distance, yes. We don't further so. Well, I'll stay on it longer and make it come to your neighborhood.

Waxer would know, she's on the block that doesn't have it. All right. Hearing no other questions by, what's that?

Yeah, we want that bus to come all the way back to Lincoln. So if CTA is listening. Hearing no other questions by committee members, do I get a motion to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine forum?

Alderman Conway makes the motion. Any objections? Hearing none, the substitute narrative and plans are accepted and the item is passed.

[Speaker 2] (1:59:42 - 1:59:43)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:59:43 - 2:00:20)
Substituted. Well, sit tight. Actually, we're gonna recall the previous item.

Jimena Castro, if you would join. We're gonna go back to the middle of page five. It's item number 22339 in the 45th ward.

Ordinance referred 12424. Common address is 5123 West Montrose Avenue. Change request is RS3 residential single unit detached house district to a B21 neighborhood mixed use district.

This is the item we had some questions on earlier. I understand we have a little bit more information from the attorney and the building department or yeah. So Jimena Castro.

[Speaker 4] (2:00:21 - 2:01:13)
Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. For the record, my name is Jimena Castro, zoning attorney at Acosta Escort back on the matter for the property located at 5123 West Montrose. We had an opportunity to a few moments ago to look at the letter of opposition.

Thank you to the committee for sharing that letter. My colleague Rolando met with the community on a Zoom call and the community recommended that this item would be supported by the alderman to reactivate those commercial units. And at this time, I understand that there are building violations and we need to obviously remedy those, we will.

And looking at this letter, the person that addressed this letter actually has a background in commercial brokerage. So that was interesting to also learn.

[Speaker 2] (2:01:14 - 2:01:36)
I think one other thing for those who are concerned about the commercial space, we're talking about two storefronts that are approximately 700 square feet each. So this is not a substantial commercial activity there. And we can't, so she cannot secure the permits if the violations are on the storefront, unless we change the zoning because the use is not allowed.

[Speaker 1] (2:01:37 - 2:01:42)
Right, so the zoning changes needed to obtain the permit to do the work to correct the building violations.

[Speaker 2] (2:01:42 - 2:01:42)
Correct.

[Speaker 1] (2:01:42 - 2:01:45)
And that's important. And there was a community meeting.

[Speaker 2] (2:01:45 - 2:01:46)
There was a community meeting.

[Speaker 1] (2:01:46 - 2:02:06)
So that was some of the questions. I know that had come up earlier. Were there any other questions from committee members to follow up?

Then can I get a motion to pass? Bill Alderman Conway moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, the item is passed. Thank you. Thanks for coming back on that.

[Speaker 4] (2:02:06 - 2:02:07)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:02:07 - 2:02:32)
All right. So the bottom of page 11, item number 22352-T1 in the 35th ward, ordinance referred 12424. Common address is 2818 through 2830 North Elston Avenue.

Change requests to C13, Commercial Neighborhood District to C12, Commercial Neighborhood District. We have attorney Scott Borstein.

[Speaker 10] (2:02:33 - 2:03:13)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. Scott Borstein from the law offices of Neal and LeRoy here on behalf of 2820 North Elston LLC. This site was formerly zoned C13 for a four to five story mixed use building under a type one amendment.

And as you know, when you change the use, you have to come in with a new type one. So we have done that. We've filed a new type one application that takes it back to the C12.

I will point out though that we do have a substitute narrative and plans for this one. So I would ask that those records be considered as part of this hearing.

[Speaker 1] (2:03:13 - 2:03:24)
All the woman down was to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the substitute narrative and plans are accepted.

[Speaker 10] (2:03:24 - 2:04:08)
Great. So we met with the local community groups who actually asked us to make some changes to the building, which we did do. And that's what's reflected in the revised plans.

Then we had a subsequent community wide meeting that's part of the aldermen's transparent zoning process. And then we gave the community a couple of weeks to give responses. And apparently the responses were generally positive.

So I'm hoping the alderman who I see is here will indicate his support for the project. He did send an email, so okay. So anyway, we have our team here.

If you'd like us to run through the plans or we can just simply answer questions.

[Speaker 1] (2:04:09 - 2:04:15)
Great, any questions by committee members? So I know Alderman Rosa has given his support. Do you want to add anything?

[Speaker 33] (2:04:17 - 2:04:34)
Yeah, I just want to appreciate the developer for working with Locust Grove Preservation, Avondale Neighborhood Association. They were very responsive to the community group's feedback. We had a community meeting, majority of attendees were in support and a majority of the feedback we received are in support.

And so we're happy to welcome this new business to the 35th Ward. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:04:34 - 2:04:44)
Thank you, any other questions? Seeing none, Vice Mayor Burnett moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine forum. Hearing no objection, the item is passed as substituted.

[Speaker 5] (2:04:45 - 2:04:46)
Thanks so much.

[Speaker 1] (2:04:48 - 2:05:14)
The top of page 12 is item number 22309-T1 in the 27th Ward. Ordinance referred 121323. Common address is 1035 to 1049 North Orleans Street and 325 to 333 West Hill Street.

Change request is at DX5 Downtown Mixed Juice District to DX5 Downtown Mixed Juice District. We have Attorney Scott Borstein.

[Speaker 10] (2:05:18 - 2:06:18)
You're on. There we go, thank you. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, Scott Borstein again from Neelam Roy here on behalf of Afterschool Matters for the property located generally at 1065 North Orleans. Again, this is a site that was previously zoned under a Type 1 ordinance back in 2019. The prior proposals for a hotel and some event space, that project didn't move forward. And so my client was lucky enough to acquire the site and is moving forward with a new Afterschool Matters location, which I'm sure everybody here is familiar with.

Afterschool Matters, excellent work. So we filed our Type 1 amendment, keeping the DX5 district, but we did have to file a substitute narrative and plans. We had made just some minor changes to the facade on Orleans.

And so I would ask that those be considered today.

[Speaker 1] (2:06:18 - 2:06:29)
Sure, Alderwoman Ramirez moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the Type 1 application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the substitute narrative and plans are accepted.

[Speaker 10] (2:06:29 - 2:06:55)
Terrific, thank you. So Afterschool Matters did have a community meeting at the request of the Alderman, and which went very well with pretty much overwhelming support for the project. I know the Alderman is here, and we'll, I'm sure, hear from him.

And we have our entire Afterschool Matters team here. If you wanna hear any more about the project itself or any of the architecture, happy to present that or just answer questions.

[Speaker 1] (2:06:56 - 2:06:58)
Great, thank you very much. Vice Mayor Burnett.

[Speaker 11] (2:06:58 - 2:07:45)
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. As the Councilor said, we did have a community meeting with the New North Unity Program, which is a community organization in our ward. And we had a community meeting, and we took a vote at that meeting, and everybody was overwhelmingly supportive of the project.

Coincidentally, this is over in the New North area, Cabrini-Green area. I actually used to go roller skating in this facility. It's part of St. Joseph's Church. So it was only fitting to have something put back there that is going to help you. So I support this and ask for the committee's support. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:07:45 - 2:08:14)
Great, thank you, Vice Mayor. Any photos of you roller skating back in the day here? That would be on the slideshow, that we'd put up.

Any other questions by committee members? I know we're all familiar with After School Matters. I think if you're not, we're going to be taking a tour once this opens.

Please invite everybody on the committee, and congratulations to you and Oliver and Burnett. Seeing no other questions, all the remandal moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, the item is passed as substituted.

[Speaker 5] (2:08:15 - 2:08:16)
Thank you. Thank you so much.

[Speaker 1] (2:08:17 - 2:08:41)
Middle of page 12 is item number 22338 in the 38th ward, ordinance referred 12424, common address 4125 North Narragansett Avenue. Change request is an RS2 residential single unit detached house district to an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district. We have attorney Paul Colpac.

[Speaker 25] (2:08:42 - 2:09:24)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My name is Paul Colpac representing the applicant. Property in question is on R2.

It's approximately 18,500 feet and is improved with a two and a half story single family residence. As you mentioned, our request is to change the zoning from RS2 to that of RT4 for 18 dwelling units, which matches the zoning change and the number of units to the property adjacent to the north of our property. We've had two community meetings scheduled by Alderman Visato.

We do have a letter of recommendation from the Alderman for due pass. If I have any questions, I'm happy to answer them.

[Speaker 1] (2:09:26 - 2:09:33)
Great, thank you, Mr. Colpac. We do have a letter from Alderman Visato on this item. You must have a large lot to get 18 units.

[Speaker 25] (2:09:33 - 2:09:47)
It is, that area on Irving Park goes back almost 200 feet. And that's why a lot of these lots have been purchased and changed to the zoning. Like I said, it goes from a two and a half story single family home to 18 dwelling units.

[Speaker 1] (2:09:47 - 2:10:00)
Sure, all in three floors. Yes. Okay, great.

Any other questions by committee members? Hearing none, Alderman Conway moves due pass by the same motion that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, the item is passed.

[Speaker 25] (2:10:00 - 2:10:03)
Thank you very much for your consideration, your time, be well, be safe.

[Speaker 1] (2:10:03 - 2:11:09)
Thank you. Okay, so the next item at the bottom of page 12, we're gonna defer to a date certain. That's item number 22336 in the 43rd ward, ordinance referred 12424.

Common address is 2519 North Halstead Street. Change request is B12, neighborhood shopping district to B33, community shopping district. Alderperson Fuentes makes a motion to defer the previously read item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

We're deferring that to the March 14th committee meeting. That's our date certain. Any objections?

Hearing none, the item is deferred. We'll see in a couple of weeks. Thank you.

Thank you. Top of page 13, item number 22332-T1 in the 44th ward, ordinance referred 12424. Common address 3837 to 41 North Clark Street.

Change request, B32, community shopping district and B23, neighborhood mixed use district to B23, neighborhood mixed use district. We have attorney Sarah Barnes.

[Speaker 6] (2:11:10 - 2:14:07)
Thank you. Good morning, honorable chair and esteemed committee person. I'm happy to be here.

My name is Sarah Barnes and I'm an attorney with the law office, Gozdecki, Delquideche, Americus and Brocado, LLP. I'm here this morning or afternoon now probably on behalf of the applicant, Clark Apartments, LLC with a proposal seeking a type one zoning map amendment with corresponding administrative adjustment relief pursuant to section 1713-03-D of the Chicago Zoning Ordinance in order to permit the expansion of an existing five-story, nine-unit residential apartment building at the subject site. The programming for the new improvements calls for the erection of a four-story lateral addition off the south side of the existing five-story building.

The proposed new addition will follow the lines of the existing building directly again, lateral into the south. The proposed new addition will feature six new dwelling units for a total of 15 dwelling units at the subject site. The subject property is located within 2,640 feet of the Addison CTA station.

And therefore we are complying with all of the Transit Served Location Guidelines and the Pedestrian Street Guidelines under the current Zoning Ordinance and the Connected Communities Ordinance. Towards that end, the proposed new addition will have service parking for three vehicles, which will allow for the preservation of some rear yard open space on this irregularly shaped lot. Towards that end, the related administrative adjustment relief that we are seeking is for a reduction in the required rear yard setback of less than 50% for the residential use.

And that will be from 30 feet, which is generally required, to 19 feet. That setback again does follow the existing setback for the current building, as well as meets the predominant setback for the block, considering that this is an irregular block of Clark Street where the alley kind of runs obtuse at the rear end, making all of the properties substandard in depth. We have worked with the Honorable Chair, Alderman Bennett, as well as with the Southport Neighbors Association and some of the other residents in the neighborhood towards the programming for the proposed new improvements.

And we do believe we have the support of all such parties at current time. I'm happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (2:14:08 - 2:14:44)
Great, thank you, Sarah. Let me just add, I think this project started many years before I became Alderman, actually, but I was very familiar with it because it's happened, I think this is step three on the building that has a neighbor to the north of a cemetery and a very odd, high-shaped, ever-decreasing lot depth as you go south due to the angle of Clark Street and the alley there. It's also a block that we're probably gonna look at to do more B2 at.

So that's sort of the skinny there. There's been no issue with the neighbors so far. Any questions, Alderman Lozada?

[Speaker 8] (2:14:48 - 2:15:03)
I think the Chair, I believe this is an answer, a question I should already know the answer to, but is this a sufficient enough addition that it falls under the compliance with the ARO, or how does that work when you're going from nine to 15?

[Speaker 1] (2:15:06 - 2:15:13)
So on the ARO question, I know we don't have housing here, but my understanding is it's 10, but I'll let the attorney answer.

[Speaker 6] (2:15:15 - 2:15:21)
So the requirement by ordinance is whenever you're adding more than five.

[Speaker 8] (2:15:21 - 2:15:24)
Okay, but just checking just in case.

[Speaker 6] (2:15:24 - 2:15:47)
But the nice thing about, and actually the reason, the impetus behind this addition is there's been such high demand for these apartments because they're larger rentals and they're new in this neighborhood, which is hard to find. So they're actually trying to keep them also affordable for families who can't otherwise afford the home.

[Speaker 8] (2:15:48 - 2:15:49)
They should look at the assessor's program.

[Speaker 6] (2:15:50 - 2:16:03)
Yeah, they are very economically responsible. And I think they have been working with the state on some other funds to keep it economically viable for other families. Awesome, thank you Sarah.

Yeah, of course.

[Speaker 1] (2:16:04 - 2:16:09)
So just to reiterate, the setback relief was rear yard?

[Speaker 6] (2:16:09 - 2:16:14)
Yeah, administrative adjustment, rear yard setback from 30 feet to 19.

[Speaker 1] (2:16:15 - 2:16:16)
Great, well, that's it.

[Speaker 6] (2:16:16 - 2:16:18)
That's all, we complied with everything else.

[Speaker 1] (2:16:18 - 2:17:35)
Great, any other questions by committee members? Hearing none, Alderman Hall moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, the item is passed. Thank you. Middle of page 13, we're gonna defer this item.

It's item number 22328 in the 45th ward, ordinance referred 12424. Common address is 3955 North Kilpatrick and 3865 North Milwaukee. Change request RS3 residential single unit detached house district to B33 community shopping district and then to a residential business plan development.

Deferring it has not been to the plan commission yet for that reason. So I would ask Alderman Knudson makes a motion to defer the previously read item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, the item is deferred. We'll see you soon. Bottom of page 13 is item number 22278 in the 12th ward.

Ordinance referred 10423. Common address is 3000 through 3002 West 41st street. Change request an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to RT4 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district.

We have attorney Robert, I'm sorry, Roberto Martinez.

[Speaker 24] (2:17:36 - 2:18:44)
Good afternoon to the committee. I am here on behalf of the applicant PMSI Investments LLC solely owned by David Rodriguez. The subject property is located at 3000 to 3002 West 41st street where the applicant intends to have the property rezoned to an RT4 to allow for the conversion of a two unit building.

The property is currently improved with a single family structure that was evidently built as a commercial property and currently has a bakery sign still on it. The property is rather large, 5,916 square feet of building footprint and that is only one floor tall. Therefore the applicant intends to use this large space for two units and there is enough space for five parking spaces in the rear which are not needed at all by the zoning ordinance.

[Speaker 1] (2:18:46 - 2:18:50)
Great, thank you, Mr. Martinez. Alderwoman Julia Ramirez, did you want to add?

[Speaker 35] (2:18:51 - 2:19:01)
Just a short comment, but I want to thank Mr. Martinez for working with our office and I'm just really happy to see that we'll have an additional unit for housing in the ward, so thank you.

[Speaker 24] (2:19:02 - 2:19:02)
Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (2:19:03 - 2:19:44)
Thank you, any other questions by committee members? Hearing none, Alderwoman Cruz moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Hearing no objections, no objections, the item is passed.

Thank you. Our final item on the day, yes, yes. Top of page 14, item number 22264 in the 23rd ward.

Ordinance referred 91423. Common address is 5210 to 5212 South Luna Avenue. Change request is an RS2 residential single unit detached house district to an RS3 residential single unit detached house district.

We have attorney Christopher Casvara.

[Speaker 26] (2:19:45 - 2:20:42)
Very good. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My name is Chris Casvara, attorney with the offices of 5838 South Archer Avenue.

I am appearing on behalf of the applicant, Modern Structures Company. Luke Ostrinsky, officer of the corporation is present as well. This property is a vacant lot measuring 50 feet frontage by 125 feet depth.

The applicant seeks to rezone the property from an RS2 residential single unit district to an RS3 residential single unit district. The applicant seeks to subdivide the property into two lots with each lot measuring approximately 25 feet by 125 feet. The applicant intends to construct a single family residence with a two car garage on each lot.

Each proposed building will be 30 feet high. Alderman Taveras has issued a letter of support for this amendment and I'm requesting the committee's favorable recommendation. Thank you.
