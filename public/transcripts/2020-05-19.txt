[Speaker 11] (4:12 - 4:15)
You're looking good, girl, that blue background.

[Speaker 25] (4:17 - 4:19)
We gotta get the contrasting colors, you know.

[Speaker 11] (4:41 - 4:44)
I'm sorry, Maria, my wife told me I said that.

[Speaker 25] (4:44 - 4:51)
I have to stay on mute during most of my meetings because my wife is working in the same room with me and she's always correcting me.

[Speaker 1] (4:53 - 5:01)
Colleagues, and we're still waiting for a few more of our colleagues before we start, thank you. Oh, we're on last. You have a background now.

[Speaker 25] (5:02 - 5:12)
You know, the funny thing is it's my old computer, so my old desktop, I've been using it for the council meetings. It's got a faster processor than my laptop, so I can do the backgrounds.

[Speaker 11] (5:15 - 5:30)
Yeah, I got a laptop, an iPad, I have an iPad. But you know, I tell you, you know, every time I was all over the world, one day he's in a restaurant, the next day he's in a city hall.

[Speaker 9] (5:34 - 5:41)
We can't all have the Picasso version of ourselves behind us, which I love, by the way.

[Speaker 11] (5:46 - 5:48)
Go and look them up on the internet and take them.

[Speaker 1] (5:51 - 5:52)
Lopez.

[Speaker 9] (5:53 - 5:56)
There's a wonderful new technology called Google.

[Speaker 1] (5:56 - 6:56)

Do we have, Alderman Beal, you have your hand up. Yes, Mr. Chairman. If I can request to have also file number 20373 at 11944 South Prairie be deferred until the next committee meeting.

[Speaker 1] (14:25 - 14:48)
Okay, let me repeat that. Hold on a second. Okay, so on the motion to add to the deferred item, Alderman Beal would like document number 20373 in the ninth ward, the common address 11944 South Prairie Avenue.

Is that your request to have that item deferred?

[Speaker 21] (14:49 - 14:50)
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (14:50 - 14:56)
Thank you, Alderman. All right, so with the entire list of deferred.

[Speaker 21] (14:57 - 15:00)
I move we defer to the- Wait a second, wait a second.

[Speaker 1] (15:00 - 15:09)
Before we do that, Alderman Cidlowski-Garza has her hand up. Can you unmute yourself, please?

[Speaker 4] (15:11 - 15:14)
Yes, I apologize. Thank you. Good morning, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (15:15 - 15:21)
I just have a question. Traditionally, would these items would have gone before the planning commission and then come to zoning?

[Speaker 35] (15:22 - 15:22)
Is that what you did?

[Speaker 1] (15:23 - 15:26)
Yes, yes. And is it because the planning commission has not met?

[Speaker 24] (15:27 - 15:27)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (15:28 - 15:34)
Yes. Okay, so- It's a standard procedure. There's nothing to do with the current crisis.

[Speaker 35] (15:35 - 15:37)
Right, right, right. That's what I'm asking.

[Speaker 1] (15:38 - 16:13)
Yeah, all these large projects need an affirming vote from the planning commission before they proceed to the city zoning committee. So what does that mean for these projects then? We have to wait until they go to the front?

We have to come back after they go to the zoning committee? I'm sorry, the planning commission? They will be heard in the order, which you'll have to check with the planning department at the plan commission.

And if there is an affirmative vote from the planning commission, it can be immediately referred to the following zoning committee meeting. If it's the request of the alderman too.

[Speaker 4] (16:15 - 16:22)
Oh, the development that's on the docket today with us from the 10th ward is not gonna be heard.

[Speaker 1] (16:22 - 16:31)
It has to go to planning commission first. Is that- Absolutely correct. Thank you.

Okay. And then we have Alderman Siccio Lopez, question.

[Speaker 8] (16:32 - 16:47)
Yeah, thank you, chairman. Just for the record, I know that there was an item, a landmark proposal in a sitting in committee since May. So just for the record, I submitted the paperwork for a substitute ordinance.

So just wanna make sure that these are on record.

[Speaker 1] (16:48 - 16:54)
Duly noted. Thank you, Alderman. Okay, can I get a motion on the deferred items?

[Speaker 21] (16:54 - 16:56)
So moved. Moved to pass.

[Speaker 1] (16:56 - 17:00)
Moved by Alderman Beal. All those in favor? Aye.

[Speaker 21] (17:00 - 17:01)
Aye. Opposed?

[Speaker 1] (17:02 - 17:38)
Aye. The ayes have it and these items are deferred. Thank you.

Now we're gonna move, at this time we'll now begin the public comment period. Out of respect for everyone's time, each speaker is limited to three minutes to address all items on the agenda. This will be the only opportunity to address these items on the agenda and the committee will not conduct separate public comment periods for each agenda item.

We have eight speakers signed up to speak today. We're ready. We're ready.

[Speaker 13] (17:44 - 17:55)
Eugene. Excuse me, I'm sorry. My name is Eugene Cornoda.

Is this appropriate time to speak?

[Speaker 1] (17:55 - 17:57)
Yes, sir. You're on the air, let's go.

[Speaker 13] (17:57 - 20:58)
Okay. Mr. Chairman and members of the commission, thank you for allowing me to speak today. My name is Gene Cornoda and owner of 14 West Erie and the property on either side.

We're not opposed to historic preservation nor this district. We are experienced in adaptive reuse and have renovated historic buildings on the national register. I am speaking here believing that this commission will consider a plea that the possibility exists that a building has not been accurately, fairly or prudently chosen for landmarking, that a mistake or poor judgment could have been made and that 14 West Erie does not belong in this district.

Consider the following. A well-respected historian, Susan Benjamin, expertly conducted in 2017, long before the district, that the building does not qualify as historic. Far from it, in her own words, landmarking this building is not in the public good.

The building's entry has been changed. A six foot high concrete wall obstructs its visibility from passing pedestrians and the street context is gone. The building has endured significant water damage, decay, settlement, and we're concerned about its cost for repair and restoration.

A second report by Ms. Benjamin suggests that there are numerous alternate Italianette buildings to choose from in its ward, not to mention a vast inventory throughout the city, a form of architecture far from extinct and a peculiar decision for why our building was included. This Italianette style is often found in a series of buildings, but the complimentary architecture on either side of this building has already been demolished. This building will sit solely in the middle of a development site.

And is this a smart decision? With planning ongoing from 2014 through 2017, Alderman Riley did not object to the building's removal. We have expended significant time and money on development plans, which will be of right within the existing DX5 zoning and will contribute significantly to the community in jobs, tax revenues, and the general vitality of this neighborhood.

With an able and ready tenant, the project will create the following incremental tax revenues, $2,700,000 in occupancy taxes, $1,400,000 in real estate taxes, $525,000 in sales taxes for an incremental increase of over $4 million annually. Is this revenue forfeiture in the public good? 400 construction jobs, 200 permanent jobs, and an additional 100 ancillary jobs, a potential contribution.

[Speaker 1] (20:59 - 21:07)
Mr. Coronado, your time is up. Thank you. Our next speaker is Brian Farley.

[Speaker 15] (21:09 - 21:11)
Hi, this is Brian Farley. Can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (21:12 - 21:14)
We can, Mr. Farley, proceed.

[Speaker 15] (21:14 - 24:18)
All right, thank you. I'm here to speak in opposition to the new Northside Multiple Property Landmark District. I have been told that this issue is one of aldermanic privilege, and that my comments are likely to fall on deaf ears.

I'm hoping that you will all keep an open mind and consider doing the right thing, especially given that we are in the midst of a COVID crisis that is forcing us all to view our world quite differently. You should know that I recently filed a 100-page multi-count complaint challenging this landmark district and urge you to review a copy of the complaint since my time here is limited to three minutes. I have asked that a copy of that complaint be provided to all the aldermen at this meeting, and I hope the staff has done so.

For the record, I own nine each year on, one of 15 properties being subject to this transparent attempt at landmark gerrymandering, a process that seeks to unlawfully downzone and forever restrict further development of random properties under the pretense of historic preservation. Alderman Riley started this landmark district process for the stated purpose of stopping a high rise at the corner of Wabash and Superior. The owner of those properties put in a demolition permit, and rather than downzone the property, the alderman sought to landmark them.

However, there was a problem. The buildings did not meet the minimum criteria for landmark status. The alderman got very inventive and concocted a landmark district, a district where the city even admits that none of the buildings by themselves would qualify as landmarks, but by combining them into a district, the alderman was able to meet the requirements for landmarking 15 buildings when he couldn't meet their requirements for landmarking any one of those buildings.

In fact, many of the buildings within this landmark district carry a green or a yellow zoning classifications, which means they were already found to lack any historical significance. But the Landmark Commission grabbed the chance to add more buildings to the landmark registration, okay? And they voted on and they approved, although their process was very flawed for lots of legal reasons, they voted to approve the near north side multiple property district.

What that means is that property owners like myself who have carried the burden of owning and maintaining these older buildings will now have their property rights seized and property values harmed by the city without meaningful saying the matter and without any compensation. Alderman Riley has already stopped the high rise. That battle has been won.

Why battle with the other landowners and punish innocent property owners? Please go. Thank you, Mr. Farley. Your three minutes are up.

[Speaker 1] (24:19 - 24:20)
Next speaker, Mary Lou Seidel.

[Speaker 24] (24:23 - 26:20)
Hi, thank you Alderman for this opportunity to speak in support of two important agenda items that are working to preserve our great city's historic built environment. I am Mary Lou Seidel, the Director of Community Engagement for Preservation Chicago. The Blackwell Israel Samuel A.M.E. Zion Church is a remarkable monument to the history and perseverance of the Bronzeville community in Chicago. For nearly 135 years, this Romanesque revival church has been there as a hub for religious, cultural community and civil rights gatherings. The building steward and the community have honored and upheld this grand church across three different centuries. It is important that the city of Chicago provides the formal protections and access to resources to keep the Blackwell Israel Samuel A.M.E. Zion Church in Bronzeville for another 135 years. The near North Multiple Property District includes 15 buildings that tell the story of Chicago's recovery from the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. Walking those streets, we can see, feel and tell the story of how our great city rebuilt from unprecedented devastation designed by extraordinary architects and homes for some notable Chicago families. It is essential that we offer a landmark designation to both honor this history and protect this history from the high pressure of demolition to go big and tall.

I have surveyed all the buildings in this area and these particularly buildings are remarkable examples of the period of significance. Landmark districts by definition, capture the collective value of a grouping of historic buildings. Property values have never been shown to be impacted negatively by historic districts.

And Place Economics has studied the economic impact of historic preservation and the benefits are universally positive, including jobs, retail business and heritage tourism. I urge you to approve the Near North Multiple Property District today. Thank you for your consideration of these items and your time to hear our public comments.

[Speaker 1] (26:24 - 26:27)
Thank you. Next we have Ward Miller.

[Speaker 35] (26:33 - 26:34)
Can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (26:35 - 26:35)
Yes, Ward.

[Speaker 16] (26:36 - 29:25)
Yes, good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. I'm Ward Miller, Executive Director of Preservation Chicago. You should have two statements before you.

One for Blackwell Israel Samuel AME Zion Church at 3956 South Langley. We find this to be a very important building and an anchor of the Bronzeville community. And we very much support the designation of this historic structure by Edbrook and Burnham.

This is an amazing church and structure and we really welcome the idea of religious buildings being landmarked, especially those that are such cornerstones in their community. I'm also speaking, as my associate Mary Lou Seidel just spoke, on the Near North Multiple Property District. This is an amazing series of structures, 15 in total, that comprise areas of the Near North side, the Gold Coast, Ritterville, River North, and really represent the city just after the Chicago Fire of 1871.

And so many of the buildings in this area have been lost over time. And this really does tell an amazing story of Chicago and its growth. It's by a who's who of architects that represent the city's great architectural legacy, but it also gives one a sense of history, a sense of scale.

It also provides places for small businesses, small restaurants, and really gives relief from the canyon of buildings in and around Michigan Avenue in which this district encompasses. So we really want to encourage the landmark designation of these 15 properties. They are amazing structures.

One is by Henry Ives Cobb, and he actually lived in this particular building on Rush Street. And he went on to design the old Federal Center. He designed the Chicago Athletic Club, now Hotel, the Newberry Library, and countless other landmarks, not only in Chicago, but across the country.

This was his own residence, and it's really an important component of this district. And we really encourage a landmark designation of both this district and this historic church. And we had a little petition drive in 2018, and we received 5,500 individuals as part of this petition to save these buildings on Superior Street and around this district.

So we very much encourage it, encourage you to support these two landmark districts, and thank you so much for the opportunity to speak this morning.

[Speaker 1] (29:25 - 29:29)
Thank you, Ward. Our next speaker is Richard Friedman.

[Speaker 27] (29:29 - 31:06)
Thank you, Chairman and members of the committee. I'm attorney Richard F. Friedman, a member of the law firm of Neal and Leroy, 20 South Clark Street.

And I'm appearing here on behalf of Richard H. Driehaus. Mr. Driehaus is unable to appear today, but asked me to convey his continuing support for the proposed near north side multiple property district designation. Mr. Driehaus is the owner of one of the proposed historic properties at 17 East Erie Street. The properties within the proposed district all represent an important era in Chicago's past. In addition to being representative of turn of the 20th century dwellings, each is worthy of preservation in its own right.

We owe it to future generations to preserve for their study and enjoyment, the remaining residences showing a way of life that was familiar to their forebearers. The landmark commission staff eloquently documented how these structures meet the landmark ordinance criteria for designation. I urge the committee to consider its recommendation and forward a positive recommendation to the city council.

Mr. Driehaus provided to the landmark commission a letter outlining his support in more detail. This letter is in the record forwarded to the committee and a copy is attached to my written remarks, which I've given to the committee. Mr. Driehaus, thank you for your consideration in this matter.

[Speaker 1] (31:07 - 31:11)
Thank you, Mr. Friedman. Our next speaker is Diane Gonzalez.

[Speaker 32] (31:14 - 31:18)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and committee members. Can you all hear me?

[Speaker 1] (31:18 - 31:19)
Loud and clear.

[Speaker 32] (31:19 - 31:19)
Hello.

[Speaker 1] (31:20 - 31:22)
Yes, Diane, we can hear you.

[Speaker 32] (31:23 - 32:38)
Okay, thank you. My name is Diane Gonzalez, a resident of the Old Town Triangle since 1974. She was one of the neighbors who worked to obtain landmark designation for Old Town and I'm one that has helped maintain its status since then.

My preservation interests include serving as a member of Preservation of Chicago's Board, as you've heard from my colleagues already. I ask as I did to please vote in support of the near North Wichita Property District. As stated already, I don't want to be repetitive, but these existing structures, they're so important in terms of Chicago's past.

Post-fire, what it did was a special little collection. And this is where they're located. It's close to downtown.

It's a special location. It's usually crowded with tourists, post-pandemic, hopefully. They're building survivors of Chicago's past with great interest.

I think I remember a lot of other style buildings there in commercial places, but tucked in amongst them are these wonderful, wonderful remaining buildings. And I think this vote will guarantee that interest in the near North, that location will grow. And I wish you great, and it's a win-win for everyone.

And this is such an asset to Chicago's history. It will be a travesty not to landmark these. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (32:41 - 33:03)
And our records show that is the last public speaker. So that will conclude the public commentary portion of the meeting. We'll now move on to the regular agenda.

And by the way, in regards to the landmark district agenda, so I know we have a department on the two landmark items.

[Speaker 3] (33:03 - 33:05)
Alderman Tonney, Chairman Tonney, Alderman Riley.

[Speaker 1] (33:06 - 33:07)
Yes, Alderman Riley.

[Speaker 3] (33:09 - 33:12)
But to be clear, we've taken all testimony for that item now, correct?

[Speaker 1] (33:13 - 33:14)
Correct, correct, Alderman.

[Speaker 35] (33:15 - 33:15)
All right, thank you.

[Speaker 1] (33:16 - 34:03)
Okay, great. Thank you, Alderman. All right, so we're gonna move to the regular agenda.

In an effort to minimize technical difficulties and to ensure the committee moves as smoothly as possible, the typical order in which the items will be heard has been updated. Throughout the duration of the virtual committee on zoning meetings, the items will be grouped together according to the witness attorney. And we'll hear all the applications from a particular attorney group, regardless of what ward is, so that we can continue to wean off the number of people on the call.

Does that make sense? Nod? Yeah.

Okay, all right.

[Speaker 35] (34:04 - 34:04)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (34:06 - 34:14)
Okay, okay. So now we're gonna start, and do I need to read the page number?

[Speaker 36] (34:14 - 34:15)
No.

[Speaker 1] (34:15 - 34:41)
Okay, all right. So the 3641-T1, the ordinance was referred on April 22nd. The common address is 2655 West Haddon Avenue.

And the change request is an RT4, residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit to unit district. So our witness on this and the following items are gonna be is Sarah Barnes. Sarah.

Yeah.

[Speaker 4] (34:44 - 37:16)
Good morning, everyone. I'm happy to be here this morning. For the record, I'm Sarah Barnes and I'm an attorney with the losses of Sam Banks.

I'm here on this matter on behalf of Campbell Venters LLC, who is owned and managed by two incredible gentlemen, Gabe Horstek and Josh Krueger. I'm really proud of this project. I'm really proud of this applicant.

These gentlemen go into neighborhoods and they purchase properties that are problematic, have building violations, need to be upgraded. They rehab them and then they put them back out as rentals on an affordable basis. So they are going into neighborhoods and truly providing affordable housing for the residents of those neighborhoods.

Unfortunately, some of those properties come with some problems that they're not always aware of. This is one of those properties when they purchased it, it was their understanding based on an incredible amount of due diligence that the principal building contains seven dwelling units. That's a three-story building with a basement.

And then there also is a detached coach house, two-story coach house, which contains two dwelling units when going in to pull their permits in order to renovate and upgrade the units, they found out that the city only recognized or that there were some existing violations that the buildings are in fact non-conforming under the current zoning ordinance, which is RS3. And therefore that we needed to do a zoning change in order to bring all of the non-conforming conditions into compliance to allow them to finish their renovations. So we've been working with Alderman LaSpada who has also been amazing with which to work over the course of the last year in order to cure these non-conforming conditions, hence the zoning change that we are requesting here today, which will allow this building to be fully occupied again on an affordable basis to some of the residents in the area.

So with that, we have met with, like I said, worked very closely with Alderman LaSpada in his office towards this end. And I believe that Alderman LaSpada has provided a letter of support to the chairman or to the committee office.

[Speaker 1] (37:16 - 37:22)
We have heard from Alderman LaSpada and he is in support of the application.

[Speaker 4] (37:22 - 37:42)
Wonderful. So there's no physical expansion of the existing buildings. All of the work is interior.

We're just trying to bring the actual existing improvements into compliance. They've been there for over a hundred years. So with that, I respectfully request the committee's approval of this project.

[Speaker 1] (37:42 - 38:06)
Okay, questions from committee members? I don't see any hands raised. Hold on a second.

Sarah, you said in your testimony that the existing zoning was an RS3. On our records, we have an RT4 as the existing.

[Speaker 4] (38:07 - 38:23)
You're correct. Sorry, my apologies. It is RT4.

We are seeking to go to an RM6 again because of the already existing nine units. Towards that end, this was filed as a type one zoning change application. However, there were no changes, so there are no supplements.

[Speaker 1] (38:25 - 38:34)
You know, for the future though, that's a pretty, is there going to be an effort to rezone it back down or what, because an RM6 sitting on a residential lot is pretty high.

[Speaker 4] (38:37 - 38:45)
Yeah, there has not been a commitment or a request to do so at this time. However, we'd be more than happy to.

[Speaker 1] (38:45 - 38:46)
But it is not a T1 either.

[Speaker 4] (38:48 - 38:51)
It was, yeah, it's a type one.

[Speaker 1] (38:52 - 38:59)
This is a type one? Yes, yeah. What does it say then?

Okay, okay. Okay, at least you have some protections on it. I'm sorry.

[Speaker 4] (38:59 - 39:05)
Yeah, we have a type one and we also have a restrictive covenant that's being recorded against the property.

[Speaker 1] (39:06 - 39:09)
All right, Alderman Moore has a question.

[Speaker 35] (39:10 - 39:12)
No, I was just saying no questions moved to pass.

[Speaker 1] (39:12 - 39:19)
Okay, I'm sorry, Alderman. Alderman David Moore moves to pass. All those in favor?

Aye. Aye.

[Speaker 31] (39:20 - 39:20)
Any opposed?

[Speaker 1] (39:22 - 39:52)
Hearing none, the item is passed. Thank you, Sarah. Now we'll move on to item number 20358.

In the 15th ward, ordinance is referred on April 22nd of this year. Common address is 4117 South Albany. The change request, RS3, residential single unit detached house district to an RM4.5 residential multi-unit district. Sarah, you're on.

[Speaker 4] (39:53 - 42:13)
I know, I was muted by the host. Thank you once again for the record, committee members. My name is Sarah Barnes and I'm an attorney with the Losses of Sam Bank.

I'm here for this matter on behalf of the applicant, HBH Development LLC, who is owned and managed by Mr. James McCluskey. I have been blessed over the last couple of months that I've gotten to work with some great gentlemen who go in, again, this is another similar situation where this applicant goes in and rehabs kind of problematic properties, again, trying to provide some affordable rentals to the subject neighborhoods. So this is another instance where we have an existing building that is non-conforming under the current zoning ordinance.

This one is currently RS3. Mr. McCluskey would like to rehab the existing building. Again, no physical expansion of the building, just do some interior renovations, bring the existing dwelling units up to current code and standards.

In addition, over time, again, this is a building that's been there for well over 50 years. It seems to have been maybe modified by previous owners. As a result, there's evidence that there was once four units, there's evidence that there was three units.

Right now the city is recognizing two dwelling units. So Mr. McCluskey, as part of the rehab proposal, is also seeking to reestablish two additional units within the building. Again, all interior work, there will be onsite parking for all of the units.

And again, he would like to provide these on an affordable basis to the residents of the 15th Ward. With that, we reached out to Alderman Lopez, who I believe is here somewhere. He was here at the beginning of this.

And we also met with his 15th Ward Business Licensing and Zoning Committee back in January, who were very excited about the project. And with that, I just very, again, respectfully request the support of both Alderman Lopez as well as the rest of the committee.

[Speaker 1] (42:13 - 42:21)
Thank you, Sarah. Questions from committee members? I know we're going to hear from Alderman Lopez, but Alderman Hopkins has his hand up.

[Speaker 9] (42:22 - 42:29)
Yeah, is the basement currently occupied by a tenant in a non-conforming residence?

[Speaker 4] (42:29 - 42:32)
No, it's not occupied at this current time.

[Speaker 1] (42:33 - 42:35)
Okay. Thanks, Brian.

[Speaker 9] (42:36 - 43:31)
Alderman Lopez, please. Thank you, Chairman. And good morning, Sarah.

Good morning, members. Everything that Ms. Barnes said is accurate and true. They did meet with my local committee.

They were very excited by the idea of having a building put to a good use, especially increasing the units and making them legal, which has been a challenge, as you all know, something I've harped on relentlessly here. And excited additionally, because the only concern that we got locally was regarding parking. It's a very tight area, very dense area as it relates to the vehicles.

And I'm glad that the developer actually took that into consideration moving forward, which is part of the reason that we were excited to support this. So I would ask your favorable consideration in approving this matter today. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (43:32 - 44:22)
Thank you, Alderman. Any other questions? If not, can I get a motion to move to pass on- Alderman Hopkins moves to pass.

Alderman Hopkins moves to pass on the item. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? In the opinion of Chair, the ayes have it. And this item is passed.

Okay, now we're gonna move to item number 20372 in the 50th Ward. The ordinance was referred on April 22nd of 20, common address 7131 Northwestern Avenue. And the change request is a B3-2 community shopping district and RT-4 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district to a B3-2 community shopping district.

[Speaker 4] (44:24 - 45:28)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and the members of the committee. Once more for the record, my name is Sarah Barnes and I'm an attorney with the Law Offices of Sam Banks. On this matter, I'm here today on behalf of the applicant GW Properties that is owned and managed by Mitchell Goltz.

Before I begin, Mr. Chairman, I would like to note for the record that this was originally filed as a type two application, but after some community review, ongoing community review, and at the request of Alderman Silverstein, we converted this to an elective type one application. A copy of the ordinance, as well as a new type one narrative and plans was all tendered to the Department of Planning and Development in advance of this hearing. So I do ask that the type one application be read into the record here today and if approved, voted on today as well.

[Speaker 1] (45:29 - 45:48)
Thank you, Sarah. Alderman Raboyas moves to amend the application to a type one application. All those in favor?

Aye. Aye. Oh, any opposed?

Aye. Aye. Any opposed?

Nope. Okay, the ayes have it. The item is amended to a type one application.

Continue, Sarah.

[Speaker 4] (45:49 - 48:10)
Thank you so much. Again, this property is generally situated on the corner of Western and Lawrence Avenues. It is currently improved with a Baker's Square restaurant that has been unoccupied and vacant for well over a year.

The site also includes a very large parking lot. The community has been wanting this site to be reactivated for as long as it's remained vacant because it is such an integral part of the community. So with that, GW is intending to re-improve the property with a new one-story multi-unit commercial strip mall, essentially.

There will be one of the commercial units that will be a cafe, fast food, let's say high-end coffee shop that will have a drive-through facility as well as some nice outdoor dining space. And then there will be three other available commercial units. It's our understanding at this time that two of those units will be dedicated to food services or restaurants.

And the other unit will be a medical office, all of which have been vetted through the community as well as with Alderman Silverstein and have their support. With that in mind, the reason for the zoning change is unfortunately the site is rather large and it's split zone. There's a small piece along the, I believe it is the north portion that is RT4 while the rest of it is a business zoning.

So therefore we are seeking the zoning change just in order to make a uniform zoning for the site to a B32, which will allow for the redevelopment. Again, we've been working with Alderman Silverstein and her office since the very inception of this project. We've had multiple community meetings and we've also executed a restrictive covenant with regards to some of the commercial uses in addition to the type one application.

So with that, I believe that Alderman Silverstein has offered a letter of support to you, Mr. Chairman, or to your office.

[Speaker 1] (48:11 - 48:13)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Silverstein.

[Speaker 4] (48:14 - 48:18)
Great. And with that, I just respectfully again, request approval of this project.

[Speaker 1] (48:19 - 48:21)
Okay. Questions from committee members?

[Speaker 20] (48:25 - 48:26)
Move to pass.

[Speaker 1] (48:28 - 48:29)
Lester's questions.

[Speaker 25] (48:29 - 48:32)
Sorry, sorry, Chairman. This is the Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (48:32 - 48:33)
Is that Alderman Hatton?

[Speaker 25] (48:33 - 48:35)
It's Alderman Hatton.

[Speaker 1] (48:35 - 48:49)
Just to- By the way, Alderman, wasn't that great? We had a zoning application on Hatton Street. Did you, I'm surprised we didn't hear that.

I saw that, you know, if only it was spelled the same way. That's my fault.

[Speaker 25] (48:50 - 49:07)
Ms. Barnes, just a question. So I have been following, I know Alderman Silverstein has had quite a bit of community process around this and I'm curious as this passes, do you know what kind of plans or timeline is for construction?

[Speaker 4] (49:09 - 49:24)
Again, a lot of it's going to depend on permitting in light of the current state of the city, but they're hopeful to maybe be able to finish by fall, by the end of fall, 2020.

[Speaker 28] (49:25 - 49:27)
Yeah, they need sand. Did she say okay? Okay.

[Speaker 25] (49:29 - 49:30)
Thanks, Ms. Barnes.

[Speaker 1] (49:31 - 49:42)
Of course. Great, so hearing no other questions, Alderman Wolgesback moves to pass on this item that was amended to a type one. All those in favor?

[Speaker 35] (49:43 - 49:44)
Aye. Aye.

[Speaker 1] (49:45 - 50:04)
Any opposed? The Chair, the ayes have it and this item is passed as amended. All right, I have to step off because the next item with Sarah is in the 44th Ward.

So my Vice Chair, Alderman Ravois will take the Chair.

[Speaker 28] (50:05 - 50:40)
Alderman? All right. Our next item is a document number 20357 in the 44th Ward.

Ordinance referred on April 22nd, 2020, document number 02020-1857, common address 3240 North Sheffield Avenue. The change request is a B3-2 Community Shopping District to a B2-3 Neighborhood Mixed Use District. We have Sarah Barnes.

One more time, tell us about the project. Go ahead, Sarah.

[Speaker 4] (50:40 - 53:08)
Thank you so much, Alderman and Mr. Chair and members of the committee. This will be the last time you hear from me today, but once more, my name is Sarah Barnes and I'm an attorney with the Law Offices of Sam Banks. I'm here on this matter on behalf of the applicant, Rex Higginbottom.

Rex owns the subject property with his son, Shane. They've had it in their family for many, many years and intend to keep it in the family. With that, it's currently improved with a four-story mixed use building, which as Chairman Tunney could probably attest is located on a mixed use block of Sheffield Avenue.

However, it is surrounded by mostly residential buildings. As a result, it has been very difficult for the Higginbottoms to get that grade level commercial space rented, even though they've tried their hardest over the last well over a year. So with that, and in order to make it a little bit more consistent with the adjacent buildings, we are seeking the zoning change only to convert that existing grade level commercial space to a dwelling unit.

It will be a single dwelling unit. Again, there will not be any physical expansion to the existing building. All of the build out will just be to that grade level unit, but unfortunately the zoning change was required in order to get that fourth unit.

So there is on-site parking for three vehicles and there will continue to be. This site is also located very close to the Belmont Red Line, Red Line, Brown and Purple Line CTA station. So, and these are going to continue to be, or this is going to be a rental unit.

So we're hopeful that there won't be a need for an additional car. And with that, we have met with Alderman Tunney and his office as well. We presented this proposal to the Hawthorne Neighbors Association, and we did receive again their unanimous support for the proposal.

And I will allow Chairman Tunney to make any comments that he desires regarding the proposal. And again, just once more, I respectfully request your support for this proposal.

[Speaker 28] (53:08 - 53:16)
All right, thank you, Sarah. Any questions by committee members? If not, I'll ask Chairman Tunney to say a few words.

[Speaker 1] (53:17 - 54:42)
Thank you, Alderman and Vice Chair. For the record, this property is immediately across the street from my neighborhood office. So we've seen the for rent signs for probably two or three years.

And I think it brings up a larger question as we see these, I'd say the shrinkage of retail as we know it and figuring out where are the best locations for retail to remain and the potential for allowing commercial, or I'm sorry, allowing residential on the first floor in commercial districts. So it's part of a larger question. I think we and each, every Alderman is gonna have to think with their communities about long range planning and especially with the retail market, even before COVID, the retail market has been shrinking and we do not wanna see a lot of vacant storefronts.

So I know we're gonna engage with our community on a larger issue about where we would allow residential on the ground floor, previous commercial districts. But it has met, as Sarah said, with the community group and they and I supported a hundred percent. So ready for any questions for any committee members.

Thanks. Any questions by any committee members? Move to pass.

Move to pass.

[Speaker 4] (54:44 - 54:52)
Thank you so much, everyone. All right, I'm turning over my chair to my colleague, Daniel Box, who's gonna be presenting.

[Speaker 1] (54:52 - 55:03)
Before we, wait, wait, wait. Before Alderman Roboyas, you might wanna take a vote on that. Oh, I haven't voted.

The motion was by Alderman Dowell. Alderman Dowell moves to pass. All in favor?

[Speaker 20] (55:04 - 55:05)
Aye. Aye.

[Speaker 21] (55:05 - 55:05)
Aye.

[Speaker 28] (55:05 - 55:07)
The ayes have it.

[Speaker 4] (55:09 - 55:10)
Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (55:10 - 55:57)
You need a new phone. All right, I'm back. Okay.

Thank you, Alderman. All right. Now we're gonna move on with Attorney Scott, I believe on- Daniel Box.

I'm sorry. What am I doing? We're Alderman Scott.

So we're gonna move on to item number 20399, 24th Ward, ordinance referred on April 22nd of 20. The common address is 1348 South Karloff Avenue and the change request, RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to an RM4.5 residential multi-unit district. So Daniel Box, our attorney is going to present.

[Speaker 12] (55:57 - 57:15)
Good morning, everyone. Mr. Chairman and members of the, you can hear me, correct? Yes, sir.

Okay, great. Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Daniel Box.

I'm an attorney with the Law Offices of Samuel B.P. Banks located at 221 North LaSalle. I'm here today on behalf of the applicant, GMO Properties LLC. The applicant is the owner of the subject property located at 1348 South Karloff Avenue.

The property is improved with a three-story, three-unit residential building with a detached garage at the rear of the site. The applicant is seeking to permit the establishment of an additional dwelling unit within the existing building for a total of four dwelling units at the subject property. No changes are proposed to the building's height, setbacks or footprint.

On-site garage parking for two vehicles will continue to be provided at the rear of the lot. In order to permit the project, the applicant is seeking a zoning change from an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to an RM4.5 residential multi-unit district. We have worked with the local community and Alderman Scott on this project.

A letter of support should already be on file with your office, and with that, we'd be happy to answer any questions that you might have.

[Speaker 1] (57:16 - 57:40)
Daniel, we do have a letter of support from Alderman Scott. Questions from committee members? No questions?

Can I get a motion? So moved, Mr. Chairman. Moved by Alderman Ravoyos.

All those in favor? Aye. Aye.

Any opposed? Opinion chair, the ayes have it, and the item is passed.

[Speaker 25] (57:41 - 57:42)
We've heard Alderman Nod.

[Speaker 1] (57:42 - 57:43)
Okay.

[Speaker 25] (57:43 - 57:44)
Rodriguez has joined the meeting.

[Speaker 1] (57:44 - 58:14)
Just for the record, Alderman Michael Rodriguez has joined us on the committee. All right, now we're moving on to item number 20361, 36th Ward. Ordinance was referred on April 22nd of 20, common address 3122 North Narragansett Avenue.

The change request, B31 Community Shopping District to an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district.

[Speaker 12] (58:14 - 59:25)
Daniel, you wanna continue, sir? Yes, good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, once again. My name is Daniel Box, attorney with the Law Offices of Samuel B.P. Banks, located at 221 North LaSalle. I'm here today on behalf of the applicant, Ewa Blesniak. The applicant is the owner of the subject property located at 3122 North Narragansett Avenue. The property is improved with a one-and-a-half-story single-family home with a detached garage at the rear of the subject site.

The applicant is seeking to permit the establishment of an additional dwelling unit within the basement of the existing building for a total of two dwelling units at the subject property. No changes are proposed to the height, setbacks, or footprint of the building. On-site parking for two vehicles will continue to be provided at the rear of the site.

In order to permit the project, the applicant is seeking a zoning change from B31 Neighborhood Commercial Shopping District to an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district. We have worked with the local community and Alderman Villegas on the project. Once again, I believe a letter of support should already be on file with your office.

And with that, I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have.

[Speaker 1] (59:25 - 59:34)
We did receive support from Alderman Villegas. Questions from committee members? Hearing no questions, can I get a motion?

[Speaker 9] (59:34 - 59:36)
So moved, Chairman. Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 1] (59:37 - 59:40)
Raymond Lopez moves to pass on the item. All those in favor?

[Speaker 9] (59:41 - 59:41)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (59:42 - 1:00:16)
Any opposed? In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it. The item is passed.

All right, now we're in the document number 20400. In the 48th ordinance was referred on April 22nd of 2020. Common address, 5938-5940 North Broadway Avenue or street, I think it's a street.

Change request, B12 Neighborhood Shopping District to a B32 Community Shopping District.

[Speaker 12] (1:00:17 - 1:01:29)
Daniel? Morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. One last time, my name is Daniel Box and I'm an attorney with the Law Offices of Sam Banks, located at 221 North LaSalle.

I'm here today on behalf of the applicant, Edgewater C&C Inc., which is doing business as Brasserie by C&C. The applicant is the tenant of the retail unit located at 5938-40 North Broadway Street. The property is currently improved with a three-story mixed-use building with retail at grade and residential units above.

The applicant is seeking to permit a general restaurant with incidental on-site liquor consumption within the existing grade-level retail space. The general restaurant will occupy approximately 1,550 square feet of space. No changes are proposed to the height, setbacks, or footprint of the building, and no on-site parking will be provided for the retail space.

In order to permit the project, the applicant is seeking a zoning change from a B-1-2 Neighborhood Shopping District to a B-3-2 Community Shopping District. We have worked with the local community and with Alderman Osterman on this project. A letter of support, I believe, is already on file with your office, and with that, I'd be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (1:01:30 - 1:01:42)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Osterman. Questions from committee members? I have just one question for you, Daniel.

So the applicant is actually the tenant and not the owner of the property?

[Speaker 12] (1:01:43 - 1:01:44)
That's correct, Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (1:01:45 - 1:01:51)
And of course, since it is, in my opinion, somewhat of an upzoning, the owner of the property is on board?

[Speaker 12] (1:01:52 - 1:01:52)
Yes, that's correct.

[Speaker 1] (1:01:53 - 1:02:12)
Okay. Any other questions? Hearing none, can I get a motion?

So moved. So moved by Alderman Burnett, I believe. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? Opposed?

Opinion, Chair, the ayes have it. The item is passed. Thank you, Daniel.

Have a good day.

[Speaker 12] (1:02:13 - 1:02:14)
Thank you all. Have a good one.

[Speaker 25] (1:02:15 - 1:02:16)
Okay, on to Rolando.

[Speaker 1] (1:02:16 - 1:02:47)
Now, Rolando Acosta is gonna be the next attorney, and the item number is 20380-T1 in the 25th Ward. The ordinance was referred on April 22nd of 20, and the common address, 2132 West 18th Place. Change request.

RT4, residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to a B2-3 neighborhood mixed-use district. Rolando. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee.

[Speaker 6] (1:02:50 - 1:04:00)
Pleasure to be here. This property has about 3,000 square feet of land, and it's currently improved with a three-story building, which each floor contains about 1,800 to 2,000 square feet. It has two legal dwelling units in it.

It also had a third unit in it. Our client wishes to rehab the existing property without changing the footprint to make it a total of six units. The property has, the rear yard of this property is actually sunken, which is very typical of Pilsen properties where the streets were elevated, and as a result, it has no parking in the rear yard, but it does, it is within 1,000 feet of the Damon stop for the pink line, so it is a transit-served location.

Accordingly, we'd like to proceed as a changing the zoning from an RT-4 to a B2-3, then proceed under the transit-served location provisions of the zoning ordinance to have no parking. We will be providing of the six units that will be on site, two of them will be affordable, and there is, Mr. Chairman, a substitute narrative and plans for this item, so I would ask that the committee move the substitute.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:04 - 1:04:15)
Rolando, our records, we don't have a substitute, but maybe the department has it. Is Patrick on the call, please? Patrick Murphy or Ana?

[Speaker 35] (1:04:15 - 1:04:20)
I am, no, I am, I'm checking. We're in different rooms. Hold on a second.

Hold on a second.

[Speaker 10] (1:04:25 - 1:04:28)
This is Ann Robles, Chief Zoning Plan Examiner. One.

[Speaker 6] (1:04:29 - 1:04:31)
No, this is a type one.

[Speaker 10] (1:04:34 - 1:04:37)
203802. Oh, I'm sorry. It's not a substitute, it's a type one.

[Speaker 6] (1:04:38 - 1:04:56)
Okay, the only changes between the original and the substitute were wordsmithing by me, so I'm fine to proceed with the original. Okay. We met with the Alderman Zoning Advisory Board, I believe we have their support, and I know the Alderman's on the call, so I'll let him speak on behalf of his community.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:56 - 1:05:05)
Okay, all right. Questions from committee members, or let's go to Alderman Siccio-Lopez first. Alderman.

[Speaker 8] (1:05:05 - 1:05:23)
Thank you. Yeah, thank you, Chairman, to Affordable Housing Units, that obviously will go a long way for efforts of preservation of affordability in Pilsen, and after satisfying the guidelines that we have in the work, we are in support of this project, and we want to thank the applicant.

[Speaker 1] (1:05:24 - 1:05:27)
Thank you, Alderman. Questions for the applicant or the Alderman?

[Speaker 3] (1:05:28 - 1:05:29)
Alderman Riley moves to pass.

[Speaker 1] (1:05:31 - 1:05:34)
Alderman Riley moves to pass on the item. All those in favor?

[Speaker 35] (1:05:35 - 1:05:36)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (1:05:36 - 1:06:11)
Any opposed? Any opposed? I don't hear it, so opinion chair, the ayes have it.

Item is passed. All right, next. Now we're moving on to item number 20379-T1 in the 28th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on April 22nd of 2020. Common address, 2731 West Lexington Street, and the change request RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to an RM6 residential multi-unit district. Rolando.

[Speaker 6] (1:06:13 - 1:06:58)
Good morning again, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, Rolando Acosta on behalf of the applicant. Similar story here, different piece of property. This property is improved with a three-story building with a basement that is unoccupied.

The upper three floors have a total of six units. There are three parking spaces on site. Our client would like to build out the basements, which would otherwise qualify as units.

And for that purpose, we would like to rezone the property to RM6. Mr. Chairman, I heard your comments earlier about the rezonings to RM6, and we would have no objection to rezoning back if that were the wishes. We've spoken with Alderman Ervin, who said he would be communicating his support to the committee.

I am not aware whether he's done so or not. He's got it to us right now.

[Speaker 1] (1:06:59 - 1:07:06)
Rolando, we do have a support email from, or phone call from Jason Ervin. So- Thank you.

[Speaker 6] (1:07:08 - 1:07:18)
This is another case where we would end up adding two units. We would make one of the two units as an affordable unit. The rest of the units would be very reasonably priced given the market in that neighborhood.

[Speaker 1] (1:07:19 - 1:07:28)
Okay. So do I have questions from committee members? Hearing none, do I get a motion, please?

So moved.

[Speaker 20] (1:07:28 - 1:07:30)
Moved to pass by Alderman Wagesback.

[Speaker 1] (1:07:31 - 1:07:49)
Alderman Wagesback moves to pass on the item. All those in favor? Any opposed?

In your chair, the ayes have it. Thank you. Rolando, you might wanna double check with Alderman Ervin, though, about the possibility of rezoning that.

But it's up to him, so.

[Speaker 6] (1:07:49 - 1:07:50)
Sure, I will.

[Speaker 1] (1:07:50 - 1:08:13)
All right. Next, item number 20390-T1, in the 30th Ward. Ordinance was referred on April 22nd of 2020.

Common address 3218 North Karloff Avenue, and the change request. RS3, residential single unit detached house district to an RM5, residential multi-unit district.

[Speaker 6] (1:08:14 - 1:09:07)
Rolando. Good morning again, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. Rolando Acosta on behalf of the applicant.

This property was improved with a single-family home that was being used for nefarious purposes. There basically was a lot of drug activity in the home. Our client bought the property, has demolished the structure, wishes to build a four-unit building.

All of the units will be two-bedroom units on the property. Of the four units, one unit will be made affordable pursuant to the ARO provisions in accordance with the Alderman and the community's wishes. The client also owns, actually happens to own the properties to the south, so he was very aware of the problem and tried to remedy it by sort of buying the property and knocking it down and trying to build something that would be consistent with the neighborhood.

It would provide also one parking space per unit.

[Speaker 1] (1:09:12 - 1:09:19)
Okay. Do we have, we have Alderman Roboyes. You wanna speak on the item?

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 28] (1:09:19 - 1:09:40)
We did provide a community hearing on the matter, and that is correct. The client also owns a building adjacent to that. And it went through a committee hearing.

No disappointments, everything went well. So I ask for a favorable decision on the matter before you.

[Speaker 1] (1:09:40 - 1:09:43)
Thank you, Alderman. Question from committee members.

[Speaker 9] (1:09:44 - 1:09:46)
Alderman Lopez moves to pass, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:09:46 - 1:10:28)
Alderman Lopez moves to pass on the item. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Opinion Chair, the ayes have it, the item is passed. Next, we're moving on to item number 20378-T1 in the 40th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on April 22nd of 2020, and the common address is 2465 through 2479 West Foster Avenue, 5151 through 5159 North Lincoln Avenue. The change request, B3-2 Community Shopping District to a B2-3 Neighborhood Mixed Use District. Rolando.

[Speaker 6] (1:10:29 - 1:12:20)
Good morning again, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant. This parcel sits on the northwest corner of Lincoln and Foster up in the 40th Ward.

It is currently improved to 14,500 square foot parcel, so it's a rather large parcel. It is improved with a two-story building. It has some vacant retail at this point and a burned out apartment, barely occupied other units in it.

Our client has purchased the property, would like to demolish the existing building and build a five-story building that will contain 40 units. It will contain ground floor retail, a larger retail space on the corner of Lincoln, the hard corner of Lincoln and Foster. It will contain two smaller retail spaces running north along the Lincoln Avenue frontage.

It would have 40 units in the property, 40 residential units, and it will have 20 parking spaces. It is TOD to the Western Avenue bus line. We are providing four affordable units within the building, four affordable residential units, I should say.

And Mr. Chairman, sort of harking back to your comments about the ground floor retail, the corner is a very viable retail space. The sort of the northern parcel, since they're on the side street or they're on Lincoln, but not on the corner, have not been so viable. In an agreement with the Alderman, we have agreed to make those live workspace and to rent them out under affordable provisions, so at a reduced rent in an effort to try to get perhaps some artists or some other creative people to occupy those spaces and activate Lincoln Avenue.

We had a community meeting on this matter. I happen to live a few blocks from this matter and we didn't have any objections to it. It's a welcome addition to the neighborhood.

And I believe the Alderman has submitted a letter of support.

[Speaker 1] (1:12:21 - 1:12:30)
The Alderman has given us a letter of support with the caveat there is a restricted covenant on that. I believe that's for the live work spaces, I believe.

[Speaker 6] (1:12:30 - 1:12:31)
That is correct, sir.

[Speaker 1] (1:12:31 - 1:12:38)
Okay, questions from committee members? I see Alderman Osterman would like to ask a question.

[Speaker 6] (1:12:39 - 1:13:04)
Is it on the southeast corner of Lincoln and Foster? It's the northeast corner, southeast corner, yes. Okay, and are there affordable units as part of the development?

There are, there are four affordable residential units and two affordable work live units. So a total of six out of 40.

[Speaker 1] (1:13:05 - 1:13:22)
Okay, thank you. Other questions? No more questions.

Can I get a motion to move to pass on the item? Motion moved. Who is that?

I can't- Alderman Cardona. Alderman Cardona moves to pass on this item. All those in favor?

[Speaker 6] (1:13:23 - 1:13:24)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (1:13:24 - 1:14:08)
Any opposed? Any opposed? Hearing none, in the chair of the ayes have it and this item is passed.

Thank you. Let's see. Now we're going to item number 20286-T1 in the 25th Ward Ordinance was referred on December 18th of 19, common address 2207 West 18th Street and the change request.

From an RT4 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district to a B23 neighborhood mixed use district. And this was a previously deferred item. We're bringing it back up, Rolando.

[Speaker 6] (1:14:09 - 1:15:35)
Yes, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant. This manner involves an 11,600 square foot parcel that is currently improved with an L-shaped building that is proposed to be expanded through additions to end up being essentially a O-shaped building with a courtyard in the middle. It will provide a total of 28 units in the building.

There will be 11 parking spaces on site. It is a transit oriented site to the Hoyne CTA station for the Pink Line. The original proposal had 24 units in it.

The neighborhood wanted more affordable to be included. We were including four units in the original proposal. As a result, we agreed to add four more units to the building of which two would be affordable.

So there'll be a total of six affordable units out of 28. And two of the affordable will also be accessible units, which I understand are much rarer than just regular affordable units. This is all pursuant to the review and comment of not only the Alderman's Zoning Advisory Board, but also we held a community meeting on this matter.

It was fairly well attended and the Alderman received comments from that. And as a result, we do have a substitute proposal that encompasses the 28 units that I previously mentioned. So we have a substitute narrative and plans.

[Speaker 1] (1:15:35 - 1:16:03)
Okay, so Alderman Maria Hadden moves to accept the substantive narrative and plans for the type one application. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? So the ayes have it and the substantive narrative plans that have been accepted. All right, anything else for Orlando?

Nothing for me unless there are any questions of the chairman of the committee. Okay, let's hear from Alderman Sitio Lopez on this one.

[Speaker 8] (1:16:03 - 1:17:18)
Thank you, chairman. And again, I wanna thank the applicant for working with us since December of last year. For the record, we did follow a broad community during process.

We did have a committee meeting like Mr. Costa has mentioned. The community residents, again, have continued and consistently asked for affordable housing and I wanna thank the applicant for working with us for just the plan to make sure that we have more affordable housing and follow the mandate of the community of 21% affordable that we now consistently follow. We did also, for the record, a follow-up meeting that took place yesterday where we invited at least the 36 people that attended the first public meeting.

We follow up with them. We received their feedback and support as of yesterday, just for the record to make sure that we heard their concerns and make the adjustments necessary for this project. I will continue working with the applicant to adhere to these commitments that we made to the public.

And again, thank you to the applicant for working with us for now almost five months. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:17:20 - 1:17:31)
All right. Alderman, before we take a vote on this, so hold on for a second. Let's see if we can get this corrected.

[Speaker 16] (1:17:55 - 1:17:58)
All good now, Chairman. This is tech support. We are now good.

[Speaker 1] (1:18:00 - 1:18:21)
Okay. We're back, hopefully for the foreseeable future. So, questions for Alderman Siccio-Lopez.

Hearing none, can I get a motion to move to pass on the item? So moved. So moved.

Alderman Burnett moves to pass on the item. All those in favor?

[Speaker 18] (1:18:21 - 1:18:22)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (1:18:22 - 1:19:09)
Any opposed? Then your chair, the ayes have it. Item is passed.

With that substitute narrative and plans on the T1. Thank you. Rolando's done.

Okay, thank you, Rolando. Now, Alderman Riley's on the call. I know Alderman Riley has a commitment at 1230.

I don't know if the Department of Landmarks is on the call. I know we said that they were gonna be near the end of the agenda, which is not 1230. So, why don't we do this?

Patrick Murphy, if you're on the call, is Ms. Cavallo gonna be making the presentation?

[Speaker 26] (1:19:09 - 1:19:12)
I will check and I will check and get right back to you.

[Speaker 1] (1:19:13 - 1:19:20)
Okay, so we're gonna move on, but I just wanna see if we can help Alderman Riley move this earlier than I anticipated.

[Speaker 26] (1:19:22 - 1:19:26)
Chairman, it looks like Deanna has her hand up. She is on. She could possibly answer for you.

[Speaker 1] (1:19:27 - 1:19:29)
Okay. All right. Deanna, are you?

[Speaker 5] (1:19:31 - 1:19:33)
Good morning, Chairman. Yes, I am here.

[Speaker 1] (1:19:33 - 1:19:46)
Are you prepared to move this item up on the agenda? Yes. Okay, so, and how long, Deanna, is your presentation?

[Speaker 5] (1:19:48 - 1:19:50)
I would say not more than 10 minutes.

[Speaker 1] (1:19:51 - 1:20:16)
Okay, so I'm gonna get through another page, and then, but stick to it. We should have a good 45 minutes. I don't know, I don't think it'll take that long, but I wanna give Alderman Riley a chance to talk about this landmark district as we had a number of witnesses talk about it.

All right, stay tuned, Deanna. Probably about five to 10 minutes we're gonna ask you to come back on. Alderman Riley, are you on the call now?

[Speaker 3] (1:20:18 - 1:20:21)
Yes, I'm here, and I appreciate the consideration, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:20:21 - 1:20:47)
Okay. All right, sir. Thank you.

All right, next, we have Andrew Scott as the attorney for item number 20369-T1 in the fourth ward. Ordinance was referred on April 22nd of 2020. Common address is 4200 through 4214 South Berkeley Avenue.

Change request, RM-5, residential multi-unit district to a B-1-3 neighborhood shopping district. Andrew.

[Speaker 34] (1:20:48 - 1:21:57)
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. For the record, Andrew Scott with the law offices of Dykema Gossett. I'm here on behalf of Quad Communities Development Corporation.

They are a not-for-profit that promotes economic development in the Kenwood, Oakland neighborhoods, as well as Grand and Douglas Boulevards, and also the greater Bronzeville area. You had mentioned the proposal is to rezone the property from RM-5 to B-1-3 type one. The property is currently improved with an approximately 9,000 square foot building, single story.

It's used all for offices for Quad Communities Development Corporation. We're actually not proposing any changes to the exterior of the building. The purpose of the rezoning is to bring the use into conformity and also to allow Quad Communities Development Corporation to be able to pull building permits to make some improvements on the interior.

We did have a community meeting back in late 2019, and I believe you've got a letter of support on file from Alderman King. I don't know if she's on this afternoon or this morning.

[Speaker 1] (1:21:58 - 1:22:00)
We have a letter of support from Alderman King.

[Speaker 34] (1:22:00 - 1:22:02)
Perfect. I'm available to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (1:22:03 - 1:22:23)
Questions for the applicant? As I said, we do have a letter of support from Alderman King. Hearing no questions, do I get a motion?

So moved. Say it again. So moved.

Moved. Moved by Alderman Burnett. Thank you, Alderman.

Moved by Alderman Burnett. All those in favor? Aye.

Aye.

[Speaker 35] (1:22:23 - 1:22:24)
Any opposed?

[Speaker 1] (1:22:26 - 1:22:28)
Opinion Chair, the ayes have it, and the item is passed.

[Speaker 34] (1:22:29 - 1:22:30)
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:22:30 - 1:22:32)
Andrew, we're done, right?

[Speaker 34] (1:22:32 - 1:22:34)
We are done, yes. Thank you. Everyone be well.

[Speaker 1] (1:22:34 - 1:23:15)
Now I wanna have Richard Toth, the attorney for item number 20354-T1. In the 11th Ward, the ordinance was referred on April 22nd of 2020. Common address is 4351-4401 South Halstead Street.

The change request, B-2-3 Neighborhood Mixed Use District and an RS-1 Residential Single Unit Detached House District to an RS-3 Residential Single Unit Detached House District. I know we're gonna have, we have slides for this? Yep, they're up.

All right. Okey-doke. Richard.

[Speaker 18] (1:23:17 - 1:25:01)
Hello, good morning, Chairman Tony, members of the Zoning Committee. Thank you. My name is Richard Toth.

I'm an attorney at Daly and Georges in Chicago. I'm appearing, of course, on behalf of the applicant, CZ Real Estate Inc. regarding application number 20354-T1.

Let's seek a zoning change from a split zoning site to a uniform RS-3 to allow the construction of eight single family homes. The developer and the architect and the contractor would, of course, have attended a meeting. We've minimized the team, of course, today due to our limited timeline parameters.

Our property has been vacant for many years. It's along Halstead Street, just off of 43rd Place. The applicant's pursuing this as a type one rezoning.

We're gonna have eight brand new masonry single family homes, three bedrooms, four baths. We did submit a substitute narrative and site plan to the Department of Planning and Development. The only significant change from the original filing is that the original drawing did not show two car garages at the back of each lot.

So the substitute plan has been corrected in that respect. We do ask that the substitute narrative and site plan be incorporated into any approved ordinance. I'll also add that the applicant met with and received the support of Alderman Patrick Thompson, who also hosted a community meeting to present the project to neighbors.

Meeting went well, and I believe that you received the Alderman's letter of support. On behalf of the applicant, I'll request your incorporation of the substitute and our favorable recommendation. I thank you for your time and consideration.

[Speaker 1] (1:25:02 - 1:25:08)
Thank you, Richard. First of all, we need to get a motion to accept the substantive narrative and plans for the type one application.

[Speaker 22] (1:25:09 - 1:25:09)
So moved.

[Speaker 1] (1:25:10 - 1:25:13)
So moved by Alderman Ravoyos. All those in favor?

[Speaker 22] (1:25:14 - 1:25:14)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (1:25:15 - 1:25:32)
Any opposed? So now the subject narrative and plans have been accepted. As the attorney said, we do have a letter of support from Alderman Thompson.

Do we have any questions? No questions. Can I get a motion to move to pass on the item?

[Speaker 35] (1:25:35 - 1:25:36)
So moved.

[Speaker 1] (1:25:37 - 1:25:48)
Alderman Beal moves to pass on the item. All those in favor? Aye.

Aye. Any opposed? Then your chair, the ayes have it.

The item is passed.

[Speaker 25] (1:25:48 - 1:25:51)
I would say one more. Richard has one more.

[Speaker 1] (1:25:51 - 1:26:23)
Yeah, we're gonna do, Deanna, we're gonna do one more from Richard, and then we'll move to the 42nd Ward on the Landmark District. All right. So Richard Toth has the item number 20387, 43rd Ward.

Ordinance was referred on April 22nd of 2020. Common address 2530 through 2538 North Orchard Street, 701 West Wrightwood Avenue. Change request, a B1-2 Neighborhood Shopping District to an RM-5 Residential Multi-Unit District.

Richard.

[Speaker 18] (1:26:24 - 1:27:10)
Thank you. Good morning again, Chairman and members of the committee. Again, my name is Richard Toth.

I'm an attorney with Daly and Georges. Appearing on behalf of the applicant, we are seeking a change in zoning from B1-2 to RM-5. Our applicant is the property owner who attended the meeting, but we, again, have minimized the team due to our limited online parameters.

The owner purchased this building in late 2018. The building actually has seven dwelling units, and we're here today as a step towards legalizing that seventh dwelling unit. No changes are proposed to the existing building's footprint or to the exterior of the building.

It's just gonna undergo some interior upgrades. The applicant did meet with and receive the support of Alderman Michelle Smith.

[Speaker 24] (1:27:11 - 1:27:12)
We did receive the letter.

[Speaker 18] (1:27:12 - 1:27:18)
The Alderman's letter of support. So on behalf of the applicant, we do request your favorable recommendation.

[Speaker 1] (1:27:19 - 1:27:31)
We think- We do have a letter of support from Alderman Michelle Smith. Questions from committee members? Hearing none, I just have a comment.

I'm assuming there's no parking, by the way, the looks of the building.

[Speaker 35] (1:27:32 - 1:27:32)
Correct.

[Speaker 1] (1:27:33 - 1:27:41)
Is that correct? Okay. So just adding one more unit, no parking.

Correct. All right. Can I get a motion moved to pass on the item?

[Speaker 20] (1:27:41 - 1:27:43)
Moved to pass, Alderman Wagenstak.

[Speaker 1] (1:27:43 - 1:27:58)
Alderman Wagenstak moves to pass on the item. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Opinion Chair, the ayes have it. The item is passed.

And thank you, Richard. Okay. That's for you, right, sir?

[Speaker 18] (1:27:58 - 1:27:59)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (1:27:59 - 1:28:08)
Okay, thanks. All right. Now we have to go to, where's my page for the- For our member committee members, it is page 12.

[Speaker 25] (1:28:09 - 1:28:11)
For everyone else, it is on the addendum.

[Speaker 1] (1:28:12 - 1:29:07)
Okay. For our committee members, it's on page 12 under landmark designations. For the public, it's on the addendum.

Okay. All right. So we're gonna read into the record the landmark designation document number.

First of all, we'll start with the document number 02020-1821, fourth ward. Ordinance was referred on April 22nd of 2020. This is the historic landmark designation for the Blackwell Israel Samuel A.M.E. Zion Church Building at 3956 South Langley in the fourth ward. All right, Deanna, this should be a relatively smooth one. So why don't we start with that one?

[Speaker 5] (1:29:11 - 1:30:51)
Thank you, Chairman. Good morning. My name is Deanna Cavallo, and I'm with the Department of Planning and Development.

I'm here to recommend on behalf of the Commission on Chicago Landmarks that the Blackwell Israel Samuel A.M.E. Zion Church be designated a Chicago landmark. The Blackwell Israel Samuel A.M.E. Zion Church is located at 3956 South Langley Avenue in the Bronzeville neighborhood within the fourth ward. Next slide, please.

The church requested designation and the denomination owning the church building, the Midwest Episcopal District of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church consented. Alderman Sophia King has provided a letter of support for the landmarking. Next slide, please.

The Romanesque Revival-style church was designed by the nationally-renowned architectural firm of Edbrook and Burnham and constructed in 1886. The exterior features are an imposing, rusticated limestone facade and a towering central pyramidal roof with projecting gables. The Commission on Chicago Landmarks found that the church meets designation criteria for city heritage, exemplary architecture, work of a significant architect, and a separate integrity criterion.

On behalf of the Commission on Chicago Landmarks, I recommend passage of the ordinance designating the Blackwell Israel Samuel A.M.E. Zion Church building as a Chicago landmark. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:30:52 - 1:31:02)
Thank you, Deanna. Questions, we do have a letter of support from the Alderman of the fourth ward, Sophia King. Questions from committee members?

[Speaker 30] (1:31:05 - 1:31:06)
Sawyer moves do pass.

[Speaker 1] (1:31:07 - 1:31:14)
Alderman, hearing no questions, Alderman Sawyer moves do pass on the item. All those in favor? Aye.

Aye.

[Speaker 35] (1:31:14 - 1:31:15)
Aye. Aye.

[Speaker 1] (1:31:15 - 1:32:01)
Any opposed? Then you chair the item. Now we'll move on to the number 02020-1822.

In the 42nd ward, ordinance was referred on April 22nd of 2020. This is the historic landmark designation for the near north side multiple property district at various portions of North Dearborn Street, East Erie Street, West Grand Avenue, East Huron Street, West Ontario Street, North Rush Street, North State Street, and East Superior Street. Ms. Cavallo, everyone has the slides in front of them. Would you like to begin the presentation? Deanna.

[Speaker 5] (1:32:01 - 1:40:26)
Thank you, chairman. Again, for the record, my name is Deanna Cavallo with the department of planning and development. So today I'm here to recommend to you on behalf of the commission of Chicago landmarks that the near north side multiple property district be designated a Chicago landmark.

This group of 15 single family homes and small scale apartment buildings exemplifies the finely crafted residential architecture built after the great fire that once filled much of the near north side, one of Chicago's oldest neighborhoods. Next slide, please. The 15 properties are shown on this map.

The district is roughly bounded by Chicago Avenue on the north, LaSalle Drive on the west, Grand Avenue on the south, and Fairbanks Court on the east. Next slide. These three story homes at 642 North Dearborn, 17 East Erie and 14 West Erie were built just after the 1871 Chicago fire and are examples of the Italian style, the most popular style of that decade.

They're tall with narrow windows topped by carved lentils and feature deep overhanging metal cornices. Next slide, please. These two Italian structures at 110 West Grand and 671 North State also date from the 1870s and feature highly ornamental window lentils.

The one on the left with rosette adorned keystones and the one on the right with elaborate foliate accents and carved brackets under the window sills. Next slide, please. The three story flats building at 1 East Huron was built in 1880 and its design reflects the growing popularity of the Queen Anne style, which emphasized contrast in this distance with continuous smooth bands of limestone set above and below windows in a field of darker rough textured brick, now given uniform color through the application of paint.

The four story neoclassical building at 9 East Huron was built in 1874 and enlarged with the front addition in 1922. Originally built as a home, the structure was converted to a rooming house by the 1890s as the neighborhood became increasingly dense and attracted commercial development along major streets. The ground floor of 9 East Huron incorporates storefronts while the large windows of the upper floors allow light to flow into offices.

Next slide, please. The three story red brick and brownstone trimmed house at 10 East Huron was designed by Cobb and Frost in 1883. Contrasting facade materials, window shapes and roof lines incorporate a mix of decorative treatments characteristic of the Queen Anne style.

The same year, Chicago architect Henry Ives Cobb also designed his own home at 716 North Rush Street. The striking rusticated brownstone residence reflects the solidity of the Romanesque revival style with ornamental touches of the Queen Anne style. Next slide.

The extra wide red brick house at 16 West Ontario was built circa 1872. Similar in many ways to the Italianate second empire style buildings such as this one were also most popular in the 1870s and usually have visually distinctive manser roofs that place a full floor behind a steeply sloping roof. One door to the west, the three story Italian style row house at 18 West Ontario is clad in locally quarried limestone that was very popular during the 1870s and 1880s for its light color and relatively even tone.

Although the facade gives the appearance that it is composed of many evenly spaced long blocks of stone, it is clad in several large slabs of stone with false horizontal joint lines. Next please. The Queen Anne and Romanesque revival style house at 212 East Ontario was built in 1885 and designed by the architecture firm of Burling and Whitehouse.

Its facade incorporates finely crafted architectural details including foliate carvings that appear to flow from the second floor window. Delicate brick corbeling beneath roof eaves, an Oriole dormer and a curving section of the roof that conforms to the arch of the base dormer window. Two doors down, the Queen Anne style three story house at 222 East Ontario was another of several Ontario street houses designed by Burling and Whitehouse in 1885.

Only 212 and 222 remain. Third floor brick dormers feature geometric pattern pediments set against a gray slate roof. Next slide please.

A prominent, excuse me, a prominent pediment and gable caps the facade of 42 East Superior Street. The residence is clad in rusticated gray stone with a projecting second floor Oriole fashion from wood. Decorative art glass or multi-light transoms are featured on every floor of this handsome Queen Anne style home.

Next door, the double house at 44 to 46 East Superior Street has a smooth limestone facade with Italian design motifs including curved door frames, windows with carved keystones and a bracketed cornice with overhanging eaves. Next slide please. These 15 residences and small scale multifamily dwellings make up the North side multiple property district.

The near North side is one of Chicago's oldest neighborhoods developed with a diverse mix of industrial and residential uses in the mid 19th century. The great fire of 1871 decimated the area but within a short time rebuilding began. New houses and small flat buildings rose beside rebuilt homes over the next decades as the streets developed into prestigious addresses leading to Washington Square and Lincoln Park to the North.

The buildings comprised this district exemplify this second phase of historic development after the fire. By 1893, the Rand McNally tourist guide to the city published this bird's eye view of the neighborhood's notable architecture. Next slide please.

Beginning with the development of Michigan Avenue in the 1920s up to today, new high-rise office, retail and residential developments have replaced the small scale late 19th century residential buildings of the near North side. The 15 buildings in this district are rare survivors. Next slide please.

The buildings are fine examples of fashionable styles of architecture including Italianate, Queen Anne, Romanesque revival, second empire and neoclassical revival. Each building displays finely crafted architectural detail and ornament in a range of traditional materials including carved masonry, millwork, pressed metal and art class. Next slide please.

While non-contiguous, the 15 buildings in the district provide a glimpse of what the near North side neighborhood looked like in the last decades of the 19th century and the beginning decades of the 20th century, which was so different than what it has become today. So on behalf of the commission on Chicago landmarks, I recommend passage of the ordinance designating the near North side multiple resource district as a Chicago landmark. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:40:27 - 1:40:37)
Thank you Deanna. I'm gonna ask Alderman Brendan Riley, would you like to speak on this landmark designation please?

[Speaker 3] (1:40:37 - 1:44:50)
I would, thank you chairman. And I'd like to take a moment to clear up some of the misrepresentations that were made by the two or three opponents to the near North historic district designation. I wanna be very clear, this is in no way a roundabout down zone targeting a specific property.

That's entirely false. And recently the city landmark commission agreed when they approved this proposal. To be clear, this is the landmark designation of a very important historic district that encompasses about 15 properties.

And I can assure the committee that had I wanted to down zone a specific property in the 42nd ward, I would have simply availed myself of that option in this committee with all of you. The proposed district was actually recommended by landmark preservation advocates in conjunction with the city's own landmark preservation staff. To be clear, I didn't wake up one morning and take a stroll through the neighborhood and willy nilly pick some buildings that I thought looked pretty.

This went through a very granular and academic review. And all of it is predicated upon the historic significance of these structures, perhaps standalone on their own. They might not be what we would all consider to be a classic landmark property, but as a whole, as conceptual properties in a greater historic district, they do make sense.

And they do tell a narrative of a different time in the city of Chicago. This is not the first time private property owners have objected to a landmark designation. I've been through this process quite often over the past 14 years and property owners instinctively want the ability to demolish these historic structures.

And we are very selective in landmark designations downtown because we are aware of the value of land. But these particular properties have cleared every historic review. It's no coincidence that the Landmarks Illinois and Preservation Chicago advocacy groups support this.

One of the great benefactors of Chicago architecture, Richard Driehaus has submitted a letter of support for this. And he is also someone who owns a multimillion dollar property that would be conferred this landmark designation. So he actually is a part of this district as a property owner.

But again, I think that although the city of Chicago is known for its beautiful architecture and we're known as the birthplace of the skyscraper, and we have certainly approved a lot of skyscrapers downtown in the last 14 years. There's also, I think, an important role for our historic structures. These are some of the last remaining references to this great city during a different time period.

And sometimes it's in the public interest to proactively protect important buildings like these from the wrecking ball. And I believe this is one of those important opportunities for the city of Chicago. I would like to thank Deanna and her entire team with the Landmark Preservation staff in the Department of Planning for the tremendous amount of work and review and analysis that went into pulling this district together.

I'd also like to thank the city's Preservation and Landmark Advocates for all of the intensive work and research they did to support this designation. And of course, I would like to thank the city's Landmark Commission for approving this important historic district at their last meeting. So that said, I would encourage an aye vote.

Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:44:51 - 1:45:03)
All right. Committee members, do we have any questions for the Alderman or the department? Alderman Scott Wadyspeck, I understand you have your hand up.

Alderman?

[Speaker 20] (1:45:04 - 1:46:44)
Yes, Chairman, thank you. I would just like to say that I support this effort by Alderman Riley. When he mentioned the granular academic review that went into this, and I know there was people opposed to anytime we try to landmark a building or put it into a position of trying to save the historic nature of some of these buildings.

But when you look at the work that Preservation Chicago does, Landmark Illinois, and having gone through these kind of processes with them, they really do great effort, or through their great efforts, really find not just the historic nature of these buildings, but engineering aspects of it, architectural aspects of it, things that I think many years ago, when we used to have a more robust landmark division and a lot more people staffed in there, we used to see it a lot more. But I wanna encourage people to continue to do this kind of work because it's important for the history of our city. And I feel that the work that Alderman Riley has done here is a great asset to our city.

So I just wanna show my support. I think when you look at these buildings, they are beautiful buildings. This is something that does require a lot of effort and expertise to go back and make sure that they're following through on all the various steps that they have to go through.

So I wanna show my full support for what he's doing here today. Thank you, Alderman.

[Speaker 1] (1:46:44 - 1:46:51)
Thank you, Chairman. Thank you, Alderman. Do Alderman Pat Dowell, I think, would like to comment on this or ask a question?

[Speaker 14] (1:46:51 - 1:47:37)
Yes, no, I just want to say bravo to my colleague, Alderman Riley, for being proactive and forward thinking on designating these buildings as historic. I know how difficult sometimes it can be to preserve historic buildings, but these historic buildings preserve Chicago's history and add character to our communities. So I just wanted to say, I wish I had a set.

I mean, I do have a lot of historic buildings in the Bronzeville part of my community, and I know how difficult this was, and I just wanted to congratulate Alderman Riley. Good job.

[Speaker 1] (1:47:38 - 1:48:04)
Thank you, Chairman Dowell. All right, any other questions? So before I take a motion, I had a question for Alderman Riley.

Alderman, and maybe Deanna, what are the, I know I've been to the Driehaus Museum, but is that, which ones are the Driehaus buildings in this portfolio?

[Speaker 3] (1:48:07 - 1:48:10)
Can you? Deanna may want to speak to that.

[Speaker 5] (1:48:10 - 1:48:16)
Yes, Chairman. 17 East Erie is the property in question.

[Speaker 1] (1:48:18 - 1:48:35)
Okay, so, so the, okay, but as you know, Driehaus has a number of properties in this area, and those have already been landmarked? That's correct, yes. Okay.

[Speaker 5] (1:48:35 - 1:48:39)
Yes, there are landmarks in the area that are owned by Driehaus.

[Speaker 1] (1:48:40 - 1:48:47)
Yeah, because I've been in them, and I don't see them on their list, but they've been probably landmarked a number of years ago, I presume.

[Speaker 3] (1:48:48 - 1:48:50)
Yeah, we covered that one already, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:48:50 - 1:49:06)
Okay, all right. As you know, members of the committee, there were voiced opposition, there was support. We do, I think in the packet, correct me, Nicole, tell the committee what we have distributed to them.

[Speaker 5] (1:49:06 - 1:49:21)
So you should have received electronically from me a letter of support from residents, a letter of support from Richard Driehaus, and a letter of objection from a resident in which he indicates that he has filed a legal complaint.

[Speaker 3] (1:49:22 - 1:49:40)
All right, so with that, any- Chairman, Alderman Riley. Alderman Riley. I also just wanted to make sure for the record that did you receive written correspondence from Preservation Chicago and Landmark Illinois in support of this as well, or only oral testimony?

[Speaker 1] (1:49:40 - 1:49:48)
No, no, we have written testimony from both of those organizations. And those were provided electronically. And they were provided electronically to the committee members.

[Speaker 3] (1:49:48 - 1:49:50)
Okay, I just wanna make sure that's part of the record.

[Speaker 12] (1:49:50 - 1:50:00)
Thank you. Thank you, sir. A question from Alderman Hopkins.

Alderman Hopkins. Has the law department filed a response to the complaint?

[Speaker 10] (1:50:03 - 1:50:13)
Hello, this is Christy Starczak from the city's law department. I am working on this lawsuit, and this is in the very early stages. We will be filing a response soon.

[Speaker 3] (1:50:14 - 1:50:15)
Okay, thank you. We'll look for that.

[Speaker 10] (1:50:16 - 1:50:17)
You're welcome.

[Speaker 3] (1:50:18 - 1:50:24)
Alderman Hopkins, it wouldn't be the first time a property owner threatened a lawsuit over a landmark designation.

[Speaker 18] (1:50:25 - 1:50:26)
And nor will it ever last.

[Speaker 1] (1:50:28 - 1:50:36)
All right. No more questions. Can I get a motion to move to pass on the landmark designation of this portfolio?

[Speaker 14] (1:50:37 - 1:50:38)
Alderman Hopkins moves to pass.

[Speaker 1] (1:50:38 - 1:50:46)
Motion moved. All right. Alderman Hopkins moves to pass on the application.

All those in favor?

[Speaker 36] (1:50:46 - 1:50:47)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (1:50:47 - 1:50:59)
Aye. Aye. Any opposed?

Opinion chair, the ayes have it. And this landmark designation will be moved with a positive recommendation to the city council.

[Speaker 3] (1:51:00 - 1:51:23)
Thank you, Chairman Tunney. And thank you, colleagues, for supporting this important designation. And also, Chairman, I know that there's another planned development item up later in your agenda for the Tribune Tower property.

Do you expect the zoning committee to go long? Should I come back? Or how would you prefer to handle that item?

[Speaker 1] (1:51:27 - 1:51:31)
Do you have one? You only have one more item in 42?

[Speaker 3] (1:51:32 - 1:51:40)
I think I have two more items, but I want it to be available to handle any questions related to the Tribune Tower project because it was such a complex.

[Speaker 1] (1:51:40 - 1:51:58)
Okay. All right. If it's the will of the committee, we'll move to the Tribune Tower on Michigan Avenue, McClure Court.

Is Jack George available? Hold on. Mr. George. The attorney for the application. Jack George, are you? Is he on board?

[Speaker 35] (1:52:01 - 1:52:09)
He's probably on mute. Let me. Yes, can you hear me, Mr. Chairman?

[Speaker 1] (1:52:09 - 1:52:18)
Oh, yeah. There's that familiar voice. Hi, Jack.

Are you ready to move on the Tribune Tower project?

[Speaker 2] (1:52:18 - 1:52:20)
Yes, I am, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:52:21 - 1:52:28)
Okay, then we're gonna go out of the order once again for Alderman Riley, and we're gonna be, tell me what page.

[Speaker 25] (1:52:28 - 1:52:30)
Committee members, it will be on page 12.

[Speaker 1] (1:52:31 - 1:53:26)
All right, for committee members. Top of page 12. Top of page 12, and I'll read it into the record.

Document number 20323, 42nd Ward, ordinance referred on January 15th of 2020. The document number 02020-94, common address 421 through 451 North Michigan Avenue, 137 to 209 East Illinois, and 458 through 78 North City Front Plaza Drive, the change request. Change request DX12.

Okay, change request DX12 and DX16 to DX12, then to residential business plan development. All right, Mr. George.

[Speaker 2] (1:53:27 - 1:54:47)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is John George. I'm an attorney and I have offices in 71 South Wacker.

I'm here this morning on behalf of the applicant, which is Tribune Tower East, which is the owner in connection with the proposed residential plan development. As you've indicated, Mr. Chairman, this is in the 42nd Ward. It's at the southeast corner of Michigan Avenue and Illinois Street, and has frontage on City Front Plaza Drive, as well as bears the common address of 421 North Michigan Avenue.

As you've indicated, Mr. Chairman, what we're proposing to do is to change the zoning designations from DX12 and DX16 downtown mixed use districts to a unified DX12 downtown mixed use district, and then to a residential business plan development. But before presenting the specific details of this proposed development, I would like to inform the committee that this application received the recommendation of the Chicago Plan Commission when it was before them last week on May the 8th. And I would respectfully request at this time, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, that the report of proceedings before the plan commission and all the reports and documents that were previously submitted to the Department of Planning be incorporated into and be made a part of the proceedings before this committee this morning.

[Speaker 1] (1:54:49 - 1:55:01)
Alderman Raboyes moves to incorporate the records from the Plan Commission. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? The ayes have it, the records are incorporated.

[Speaker 2] (1:55:03 - 2:04:26)
Subject site, which you can see up on your screen there, measures 132,241 square feet in that site area, and is currently improved with the designated Chicago Landmark Tribune Tower and also a surface parking lot. The proposed plan development will be divided into three sub areas. Sub area A is currently improved with the aforementioned Chicago Landmark Tribune Tower.

The applicant has already received building permits and is in the process of renovating the Chicago Tribune Tower to include retail uses on the ground floor and 162 for sale dwelling units in the floors above with 261 below grade parking spaces and seven loading berths which are off of lower North Water Street. Sub area B is currently the site of the surface parking lot. The applicant will be removing the surface parking lot to make way for 1,442 foot tall building, which is 102 floors.

The building will contain retail and commercial uses along with 200 hotel keys and 564 dwelling units consisting of 125 for sale units and 439 rental units with access to 426 parking spaces and again, seven loading berths located below grade. Sub area C is in an area located within the public plaza known as Pioneer Court and will remain as such in the part of the public plaza. This plan has been reviewed and approved by the Chicago Department of Transportation.

The proposed vehicular access to the parking and loading for the existing Tribune Tower is from the lower level of North Water Street. Access to the new proposed tower on the east side of the development also occurs from lower level with garage access off of lower St. Clair and loading off access off of lower North Water. Locating the access to the parking and loading to the lower level minimizes the traffic impact of the development and frees up the upper level site plan to accommodate a more fluid pattern to and around the site.

All of the upper level drop off and pickup functions happen within an internal port for sure with lay-bys provided by at city front plaza and on Illinois Street to further limit traffic impacts and traffic ingestion. The base floor ratio FAR of the proposed underlying is DX12 zoning and has an FAR of 12.0. The applicant is proposing to utilize the neighborhood opportunity bonus to increase the allowable FAR by 3.31 FAR to a total of 15.31 for the plan development. The neighborhood opportunity bonus payment for this additional FAR is $15,057,000.

$57,489 and 20 cents. That money that 15 million is then spread out goes to the neighborhood opportunity fund. Some goes to the landmark fund and other goes into the local impact fund.

The proposed development also includes a total of 726 dwelling units. There's 162 for sale units in the existing Tribune Tower and 564 in the new proposed tower, new tower consisting of 125 for sale and 439 rental. And pursuant to the ARO, the applicant is required to provide 10% of the total number of units as affordable for a total 73 units.

The 73 units are based on 29 for sale units and 44 rental units equal to the onsite ratio of the unit mix. The applicant is satisfying their ARO requirement by constructing 11 rental units onsite, which is 25% of the 10% required and paying an in lieu fee of $6,117,408 for the remaining 33 rental units. The applicant is also paying an in lieu fee of $6,911,860 for the 29 for sale units for a total ARO payment of $13,029,268 and to the affordable housing trust fund.

The applicant's compliance with the ARO has been reviewed by the Department of Housing and by the Department of Planning and Development. The applicant is also committed to achieve goals of 26% MBE and participation and 6% WBE participation and the local hiring of city residents at 50% of the total construction hours. The applicant has implemented the following strategies to ensure that they're able to ensure these goals.

We've had letters introducing and explain the proposed project have been sent out to MBE and WBE contractor associations as indicated by the city of Chicago website. The applicant has pledged to engage in community organizations, offer direction training and personal development to match community residents with potential employers and developers, 50% residents, city residents and the applicant is committed to hold community hiring events and partner with local unions and trade schools to increase the opportunities for minority workers targeting local community hiring and the applicant has stated that they will require all bidding subcontractors to conform their commitments as part of the bidding process. The proposed development is estimated to have a construction cost of $700 million but of that, that includes the cost of the land and it also includes contributions to the fund. So the net construction costs for this project are $485 million.

I wanted just to pause here at a moment and just when I was before the plan commission, Alderman Walter Burnett asked me some questions about MBE and WBE and I thought I would just insert some of this into this presentation now before I finish up with the rest of it. With respect to the Tribune Tower that is presently being renovated, the construction cost of the project is $225 million. 26% of that number is $58.5 million for MBE contractors and 6% of that number is $13.5 million for WBE contractors. At the present time, the renovation work being done at the old Tribune Tower is 42% complete and as now they have contracted pay $20.3 million to MBE contractors and they've committed to pay $10.1 million to WBE contractors and they will continue to strive and if they haven't achieved those goals, any leftover goal that they have to satisfy what they would take up and as I said, the cost is $485 million. 26% of 485 million is 100 MBE contractors and 6% of the 485, this is a commitment that we have said and a commitment to this goal, satisfy this goal. We make that commitment, we've stated it in our document and all of the subcontractors indicated earlier are making that be installed around the perimeter of the development in locations where the parkway width allows.

In addition to parkway trees, the applicant is proposing a redesign of Pioneer Court immediately to the south of the plan development. The proposed is on a sustainable matrix and therefore we will be in compliance with the current city of Chicago sustainable development policy. This project has been extensively vetted with the mayor's office of people with physical disabilities.

Alderman Riley has held two large community meetings with the Street Reveal organization of active residents SOAR. We've also held meetings with the city front center west Illinois street residents as well as numerous meetings with Alderman Riley and the department of planning and development. This particular case was before Alderman Riley and the community for over two years.

The meetings people at the second one, the amount of work that Alderman Riley requested of us and the department of planning this project and one that we were glad to attend tonight. And I think what's before you today by DPD and by the community and our project is really a better project today than what it was when we started because of all the comments and input that we received as a result of this process. We leave their favorable recommendation.

I would like to thank Alderman Riley and the department of planning and development, all of the staff, particular Noah Sopranic who worked so hard on this. We stand ready to answer any questions concerning this mission. He submitted a detailed letter of support and I know he's here today to speak on this project and thank you very much for allowing me to make the presentation.

[Speaker 1] (2:04:26 - 2:04:34)
George, what is the wish of Alderman Riley? Do we want questions from Alderman Riley?

[Speaker 3] (2:04:35 - 2:11:52)
Thank you, chairman. This has been a long and involved negotiation over the past two years, as was noted by council. We co-hosted two community meetings where the development team, these public meetings were so well attended that the ballroom was filled to capacity at each meeting.

In addition to city front center West association where the immediate neighbors to this property, SOAR, which is the name as the residents of the condominium association at 240 East Illinois street who are immediately adjacent to the site. The app is already renovating the existing Chicago landmark which will having, but what is before us here today is the proposal to construct a 1,442 foot tall mixed use building that would have retail and commercial uses as well as, this proposed plan development is a very ambitious one. It's repurposing an iconic Chicago landmark, the historic tribune tower, while adding the second tallest skyscraper in the city to our world renowned skyline, loading patterns and open space.

And it's my responsibility to identify those concerns and work with the city planners and transportation officials and the developer to negotiate improvements and public benefits surrounding neighborhood. And so I think thanks to our robust and thorough public process, we had no shortage of opinions and feedback from the surrounding neighborhood. Following meetings with SOAR, the neighborhood and meetings with local stakeholders, we condensed all of those concerns into a working punch list of various infrastructure.

As a result of that process, many important design changes were made. Base at Upper City Front Plaza and a rather Spartan offering in its original landscape plan for Pioneer Court. After the initial proposal was rejected about a year and a half ago, parking base was better integrated into the skin of the building and the landscape and open space plans were completely overhauled and added a tremendous amount of new active green space and mature trees to the Pioneer Court superstructure that runs between essentially the Apple Store and the historic Tribune Tower building.

In addition to addressing architectural and open space concerns, we conducted a very careful review of multiple traffic and loading studies with CDOT and the traffic engineers for the architect and developer. And we were able to condense those down and create some obligations that will be, these improvements will be funded entirely at the developer's expense. And just for the record, I'm gonna give a couple of examples, but there are a couple that should be integrated into the public record because they were particular residents.

There will be the addition of new vehicular and pedestrian entries at lower level Michigan Avenue and lower level Illinois Street. Two 24-7 security offices with lines of sight to the perimeter of the building, pick up and drop off areas for ride share and passenger vehicles. All commercial loading will happen below grade in that lower level.

There'll be dramatically enhanced lighting and refreshed infrastructure with clean and refinished wall surfaces. If you've ever traversed lower Michigan Avenue or lower Illinois, it's a pretty seedy and dingy look today. And also raises public safety concerns because of the poor lighting.

There are often graffiti tags here, drug activity by dramatically improving those lower level areas and really activating it with all of the ride share activity, taxi cab usage and loading, plus two security booths. I think it's gonna make that a completely different experience for anyone who's traversing between River North and Streeterville under Michigan Avenue. It's gonna be, I think, a dramatic transformation and a big benefit to the neighborhood.

And frankly, folks have been complaining about that condition for at least 20 years. There will also be, as you've seen in the slide, some very dramatic improvements to the upper levels of Illinois Street and City Front Plaza. We made the developer go through an extraordinary step of creating a cut-through traffic lane that actually runs through the interior of their building on Upper Illinois Street to allow for hotel guests to drop off and pick up.

It takes all of that traffic and loading off of the busy curbs of Illinois Street and City Front Plaza. And this will, I think, mitigate what could have been a major traffic congestion concern and public safety concern for the residents who also live nearby. So that is, I think, a market improvement over the original proposal and at no small cost to the developer.

And then I also, finally, the last major obligation that should be called out is the redesign of Pioneer Court. Anyone who walks by that today sees a pretty banged-up, hardscape surface. It's really just a super-structured deck.

There is no meaningful landscaping or design to it. And this is an eyesore that I think will be corrected with this project before us today. There will be an addition of a new public pathway that connects Michigan Avenue and City Front Plaza, substantial increases to the amount of proposed open green space, the addition of numerous grassy berms and active lawn spaces, mature trees, not those toothpicks you see too often at development sites, and new accessible outdoor seating, raised planter bed systems, and enhanced lighting to improve public safety. In addition to these benefits to the neighborhood, there are also pretty substantial benefits to the city of Chicago as a whole. A $13 million payment to the Affordable Housing Fund, a $15 million payment to the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund, 90% of which will be targeted to communities in the south and west sides of Chicago, as well as the generation of over $25 million in annual property taxes.

At a time when Chicago needs some good news for its local economy, I'm happy to report that this project will boost economic development by creating thousands of job hours for men and women of the building trades and more than 400 permanent full-time jobs onsite once this project is completed. Although this was a long and difficult negotiation, I think it's resulted in a far superior project to the one that was initially proposed, and I think the developer agrees. I'd like to thank SOAR, the neighborhood residents, local stakeholders, and the city's Department of Planning and Development and CDOT staff for their incredible help in helping us put together, I think, an impressive list of infrastructure improvements and public benefits, and I'm appreciative of their counsel and support.

So for all of those reasons, Chairman, I respectfully request a favorable vote by the Committee on Zoning, and I'd be happy to answer any questions my colleagues might have.

[Speaker 1] (2:11:52 - 2:12:01)
Thank you, Alderman. We have a couple of questions. We'll start with Alderman Jason Irvin.

Alderman Irvin.

[Speaker 30] (2:12:03 - 2:12:20)
Thank you, Chairman. Thank you, Chairman. Just a couple of questions for the attorney and also for, as it relates to the- Jason, you gotta get closer to your mic.

[Speaker 11] (2:12:21 - 2:12:23)
Jason, you gotta get closer to your mic.

[Speaker 30] (2:12:23 - 2:12:34)
Okay, as it relates to the MBE participation, how much of that MBE participation is geared toward African-American contracts?

[Speaker 1] (2:12:37 - 2:12:47)
I don't- Mr. George, you heard the question from Alderman Irvin. You need to unmute, Jack.

[Speaker 2] (2:12:51 - 2:12:52)
Can you hear me now?

[Speaker 1] (2:12:53 - 2:12:56)
Yes, you heard the question from Alderman Jason Irvin.

[Speaker 2] (2:12:56 - 2:13:58)
I heard the question, and Alderman Lee Golub is also here to answer some of these questions, especially this one. As I told you before, a little while ago, there is $20 million so far paid in WBE and $10 million to, I mean, $20 million to MBE and $10 million for WBE. I don't, I have a list here of some of the contractors who that money has been committed to pay, but I don't know which ones are black contractors and not.

Lee, if you're on this line, do you have a, I can give you some of the names, Alderman Irvin, and maybe that will help. One is Duracor, one is Macor, Chicago Ornamental Iron, Mack Construction Services, Reflections Window Walls, Chicago Commercial Installation, G.I. Stone.

[Speaker 1] (2:13:58 - 2:14:00)
Mr. Chairman, can we just get a list?

[Speaker 2] (2:14:01 - 2:14:02)
I can get that.

[Speaker 1] (2:14:03 - 2:14:10)
Well, wait, wait, wait, wait. So, Jason, since you asked the question, how would you like to receive the information?

[Speaker 30] (2:14:11 - 2:14:18)
We would like to have the information delivered through, you know, if you wanna email it to us, that's fine.

[Speaker 1] (2:14:18 - 2:14:34)
We just wanted to understand the breakdown of the MBE contractors. Okay, so Jack, through the chair, you will provide that information so that I can get it to Jason and all the committee members that are interested in it.

[Speaker 2] (2:14:34 - 2:14:38)
Sure, I'll be glad to do it right after we finish today. I'll be glad to email it to you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:14:39 - 2:14:44)
Point of information, Mr. Chairman. Point of information, Alderman Dowell.

[Speaker 14] (2:14:44 - 2:14:57)
Yes, if Alderman Irvin would agree, can we get that information broken down by ethnicity and the amount paid to that particular contractor or subcontractor?

[Speaker 1] (2:14:58 - 2:15:03)
All right, so you heard the clarification. Jack, George, are you prepared to do that?

[Speaker 2] (2:15:04 - 2:15:32)
I did, I don't know, Alderman Dowell, I don't know if I can do that right away. I'll try to, as soon as I finish this presentation today, I'll go back to the contractors, to, I mean, to CIM and to Lee Golub from Golub & Company and ask them if they can break that down for me as quickly as they can. And as soon as I have it, I'll get it to you right away through Alderman, through the chairman of the committee, I'll get that, I'll get that to you right away.

[Speaker 11] (2:15:33 - 2:15:57)
Not the point of information, Mr. Chairman. All right, Alderman Burnett on a point of information. Yeah, Mr. Chairman, from you and I being on the Planning Commission, I had questions in reference to this and I wanted to ask the developer, again, as at the Planning Commission, would his general contractor consider joint venturing with an African-American contractor?

[Speaker 2] (2:15:59 - 2:16:06)
Mr. Chairman, I don't know if Lee Golub has been unmuted, but I think Lee Golub is on the call. Lee, can you answer that question, please?

[Speaker 21] (2:16:06 - 2:16:08)
Yes, can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (2:16:09 - 2:16:10)
Mr. Golub?

[Speaker 21] (2:16:10 - 2:16:11)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (2:16:11 - 2:16:19)
This is Chairman Tony. Would you identify yourself for the record? Are you aware of the questions via this conference?

Okay.

[Speaker 21] (2:16:19 - 2:16:59)
Yes, my name is Lee Golub. I'm a managing principal with Golub and Company, partner in the development of this project. Yes, Alderman Burnett, as we discussed at the Planning Commission, we have not chosen, we're too soon to choose who our general contractor will be for the second phase tower, but for sure, one of the requests will be made in our RFP when we go out to contractors is a possible JB with minority-owned firms and also definitely for sure the participation goal of the 26-6 and anything that was not achieved in phase one to be made up in phase two of the 26-6 as a totality of the joint PD, of both projects being part of the PD.

[Speaker 1] (2:17:02 - 2:17:24)
All right, so between Alderman Burnett and Jason and Pat Dowell on points of information and information that will be forwarded to me and then subsequently to all of you, are there any more? I know there might be, there's more questions, but can I proceed to Alderman Lopez on a question?

[Speaker 30] (2:17:25 - 2:17:32)
I did have, actually, I apologize. Alderman Burnett asked a question that I was gonna ask about.

[Speaker 1] (2:17:32 - 2:17:34)
Back to Jason, are you? Okay, all right, Jason.

[Speaker 30] (2:17:35 - 2:17:41)
No, I'm okay now. Alderman Burnett asked a question that was my next question, so we're good on that.

[Speaker 1] (2:17:41 - 2:17:41)
Okay.

[Speaker 30] (2:17:41 - 2:17:43)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:17:43 - 2:17:52)
All right, Alderman Dowell, I mean, do you have additional questions or just clarification and point of information that you wanted to bring to the committee's attention?

[Speaker 14] (2:17:54 - 2:17:59)
No, I have questions. I'll wait till after Alderman Lopez, who had his hand up before me.

[Speaker 1] (2:18:00 - 2:18:01)
Thank you, Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 9] (2:18:05 - 2:19:31)
Thank you, Chairman. Good morning, good afternoon, committee. First off, I wanna congratulate Alderman Riley on this.

I know this is a monumental undertaking and I'm certain that the communities on the South and West side that have the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund participation greatly appreciate the downtown community is once again adding to the fund. I know we don't get to say thank you enough to what you're doing in your ward that helps us in our wards, but first and foremost, thank you. Second, also, with regards to the MBE participation, I think that it is beneficial if we ensure that every demographic is allowed to participate and would strongly encourage the developers to look at all of the qualifying potential candidates that fit that description to be participating in your construction.

I think there's more than enough dollars to go around for you to go far and beyond what your stated goals are, particularly with a $700 million development costs. So I would just encourage you to look. I know my colleagues are vocal about hiring an African-American community as rightfully they should be, but there are also other members of that same classification who need to be encouraged to participate as well.

Thank you, Chairman. Thank you, Alderman. Alderman Dowell.

[Speaker 14] (2:19:34 - 2:20:13)
Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just wanted to ask the Jack if he could explain the approach to the affordable housing, how they approach the affordable housing issue. I know that you have the ARO requirement.

I'm especially interested in knowing the for sale unit buyout at 238,000. That seems like a very low number given what the for sale unit will be at that location. How was that number arrived at?

And the same question regarding the rental unit, is that a city required number?

[Speaker 2] (2:20:14 - 2:20:44)
Alderman Dowell, that's correct. The numbers of the rental buyout figure is $185,376 per unit. And that's set by the city ordinance.

Similarly, the for sale buyout figure is $238,340 per unit. And those are the amounts of money that are set forth in the city ordinance as to what the buyout figures are when you buy in lieu of putting the units on site.

[Speaker 14] (2:20:45 - 2:21:06)
So that's where we got those numbers from. Okay, so this is all by ordinance numbers. Okay, so the 11 ARO rental units that 60% AMI on site, are these spread among the various bedroom sizes or are these all 11 one bedroom units?

[Speaker 2] (2:21:06 - 2:21:27)
I can let Lee Gallop answer that, but the city requires that they be spread out. And that's what we will be doing. And that's what we do on all of the other projects that we have with the city.

The city does not want them all clumped together. And they ask that they be spread out properly. And that's what we intend to do.

Lee, if you want to add to that, please go forward.

[Speaker 21] (2:21:28 - 2:22:01)
No, I think you said it exactly as we intend. They will be spread out throughout the building as far as- What is the spread out gonna be? So there's roughly 440 units in the rental portion that'll be on floors, again, I don't have right in front of me, but above the hotel.

So as we, again, we're way too soon for actual design of those units, but they will be spread throughout the middle of the building there where all the rental units are on probably 20 to 30 floors worth of space.

[Speaker 1] (2:22:02 - 2:22:11)
So Lee, I think the Alderman's question was not just where they were geographically located, but what is the mix of the affordable units?

[Speaker 21] (2:22:11 - 2:22:36)
So the mix of the project, again, at this moment is typical to other apartment, high-end apartment buildings that we've done in the city. They're mostly studios, one bedrooms and convertibles. There's a limited amount of two bedrooms and not a lot of three bedrooms.

So when we create the mix for the entire building, we will have to, for ordinance, put the mix in for the 11 units within that range on the percentages as well.

[Speaker 14] (2:22:37 - 2:22:54)
All right, so I'm not gonna get a specific number here, as I see. I would like to ask the Department of Planning and Development, who monitors to make sure that these 11 units come in the way they're supposed to come in?

[Speaker 26] (2:22:56 - 2:23:39)
So Alderman, this is Patrick Murphy. Alderman Tunney, is this Alderman Tunney? Is that okay?

Proceed, Patrick. Okay, Alderman Dowell, I'm with the Department of Planning. The plan development has a requirement.

It has an exhibit that details out the affordability requirement. And as the project comes in for permitting through the part two process, we will work with the Department of Housing staff to make sure that the affordability requirements are met, both in terms of unit provision, unit mix, and also any in-lieu payments that are due at the time. So we work hand-in-hand with Department of Housing and the permits, they can't get zoning sign-off until they satisfy the ARO ordinance requirements.

[Speaker 14] (2:23:40 - 2:23:50)
Right, that allows them to get their permit, right? But then after they get their permit, sometimes these developers don't follow through on what they've committed.

[Speaker 26] (2:23:54 - 2:24:16)
Well, so the Department of Housing will also monitor how the units are handled over the life of the agreement. So we can get you information on exactly how that is tracked, but that is handled through the Department of Housing. And they do that for all the projects, plan developments or not, whenever there is an ordinance-based commitment for a quantity of units.

[Speaker 14] (2:24:17 - 2:24:27)
All right, and to the Alderman Riley, just curious, did you have any opposition or concerns raised regarding view corridors?

[Speaker 3] (2:24:28 - 2:24:29)
Always.

[Speaker 14] (2:24:30 - 2:24:34)
How did you handle that? I mean, what's your perspective on that?

[Speaker 3] (2:24:35 - 2:25:49)
Well, I have a preface for nearly every community meeting in my ward that if you have concerns about quality of life issues, traffic, loading, open space, street furniture, we're here to help and let's find a way to create some public benefits in the project. But if your sole purpose is to oppose a project to protect your view, that's nearly an impossibility in the Central Business District because of the very aggressive zoning entitlements that the land has here. So while it's a bummer to lose your view, and believe me, projects I've approved in my own ward have blown my view away.

It's one of those sad realities. Unless you live along the lakefront, you don't get a guaranteed view in Chicago, unfortunately. That said, we do work with the developer to try and position the podium and the tower in a sensitive way that's as respectful of as many view quarters as possible.

And frankly, the design of this particular tower, it's helpful that it's very tall and very skinny, was, I think, very respectful of neighbors' views, generally. Of course, there are always gonna be a few losers in the process, but yeah.

[Speaker 14] (2:25:49 - 2:26:00)
Thank you, Alderman. I appreciate your answer, and I don't know who the architect is on this one, but it's a very nice-looking building.

[Speaker 1] (2:26:00 - 2:26:07)
Congratulations. Thank you, Alderman Dow. All right, Alderman Walter Burnett, do you have any questions, sir?

[Speaker 11] (2:26:07 - 2:28:01)
Yeah, I just have a comment. First of all, I wanna commend the Alderman. I know how much work it is doing these things and all of those meetings and considering all of the different interests.

That's concerned about this. You have, you guys have come to a beautiful project. This is a very stunning building.

I think it's gonna be a landmark in the city of Chicago that people, I can see that guy who does those, the river tours, the architectural tours, talking about this building, because this is a very, very beautiful building. I just wanna commend the developer also at a time that we're in right now. For him and his investors to still be pursuing it, I think is a big win for the city of Chicago.

All of the money going toward the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund, 15 million to 13 million going to the Affordable Housing. The Affordable Housing Fund is beneficial to a lot of people outside of the downtown area, which is appreciative. Of course, all of us would wish that it had more affordable housing that was expressed at the plan commission, but we understand the price points in these areas and the costs.

Also wanna say, I had the opportunity to meet Mr. Golub on several occasions around a bunch of good people who have consideration for hiring people in the neighborhood. And he also appears to be in that same vein. And I look forward to him encouraging the contractors that may be working on this development to work with the community.

Congratulations to you, Alderman. Congratulations to the developer, the architect, and also congratulations to your community.

[Speaker 3] (2:28:02 - 2:28:03)
Thank you, Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 1] (2:28:04 - 2:28:04)
All right.

[Speaker 11] (2:28:04 - 2:28:05)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:28:05 - 2:28:10)
Our final question, I believe, this is from Alderman Siccio-Lopez.

[Speaker 8] (2:28:11 - 2:29:23)
Yeah, thank you. Thank you, Chairman. It's just a comment in terms of some of the comments that some of our colleagues have made about the importance of the follow through in terms of minority participation and minority contracting.

I think I will suggest that we, as we are obviously seeing a lot of the projects coming in in front of us with proposals of the Neighborhood Opportunity Funds and obviously minority participation, I do think that we need to make sure that we have a good process of binding agreements. So I'd like to propose that we work on that so we have consistency across the world on that and also full transparency so that there's indeed a commitment for these 26% minority participation. So I wanna comment on that.

And the other thing about the Neighborhood Opportunity Funds, again, since I'm part of obviously right now the Affordable Requirement Ordinance Reform that we've been part of, definitely would be good for our committee to make sure that we have a detailed information about Neighborhood Opportunity Funds and how they're operating so that we can make have a better understanding of how this process works. Thank you again, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:29:24 - 2:29:28)
Thank you, Alderman. Can I get a motion to move this item?

[Speaker 6] (2:29:29 - 2:29:31)
Alderman Capelman, move to pass.

[Speaker 1] (2:29:32 - 2:30:24)
Alderman Capelman, is that correct? Yes. Move to pass on the item as revised.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

Opinion Chair, the ayes have it. And we'll report it out if and when we receive all this information to the committee members. And as Mr. Golub said and Walter Burnett said, this is not a new request. This was something that was, I think, addressed to the Planning Commission. So once we get that information to our office, we have your preferred emails and we will get that to you. ASAP.

All right. All righty. Thank you.

And Alderman Riley, we're gonna stay with Mr. George and in the 42nd Ward item. And if you want to stay on, it'd be great.

[Speaker 3] (2:30:24 - 2:30:31)
Otherwise, I think you- I've informed the folks waiting for me that they'll have to wait a little bit longer. So I can stay.

[Speaker 1] (2:30:31 - 2:31:02)
Okay. So then we'll, let me read into the document number 20348. 42nd Ward ordinance was referred on February 19th of 2020.

Common address 220 to 340 South Canal Street, 500 to 530 West Van Buren Street, 201 through 339 South Clinton Street, and 501 through 531 West Adams. The change request, PD376 to PD376 as amended. Mr. George.

[Speaker 2] (2:31:03 - 2:31:05)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee.

[Speaker 1] (2:31:06 - 2:31:09)
Good afternoon to you. Good afternoon to you too. So.

[Speaker 2] (2:31:09 - 2:31:57)
Thank you. My name is John George. I'm an attorney with offices 71 South Wacker Drive.

I'm appearing on behalf of the applicant, which is 320 South Canal Title Holder LLC in connection with what is really a technical amendment to business plan development 376. This property, Mr. Chairman, as you've indicated, is in the 42nd Ward. It's within what we call sub area C of plan development 376, which was approved a year ago.

And it bears the common address of 320 South Canal. Again, I would ask before going forward with my presentation, I would ask that the matter was before the plan commission on May the 8th. And I would ask that the report of proceedings and all the documents that were presented at that hearing be incorporated into and be a made a part of the proceedings before your body this morning, this afternoon.

[Speaker 1] (2:31:59 - 2:32:03)
Alderman Ravoyas moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission. All those in favor.

[Speaker 19] (2:32:04 - 2:32:04)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (2:32:05 - 2:32:07)
Aye. Aye.

[Speaker 19] (2:32:07 - 2:32:07)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (2:32:07 - 2:32:13)
Any opposed? Any opposed? Being sure the ayes have it, the records are now incorporated.

Continue on, Jack.

[Speaker 19] (2:32:13 - 2:32:14)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 2] (2:32:14 - 2:37:13)
On October the 31st of 2018, the Chicago City Council approved an amendment to PD 376 for the applicant to construct in sub area C a 50 story office tower with a height of 715 feet and approximately 1,500,000 square feet of office space and retail space on the ground floor with 400 parking spaces below that with four loading docks off of Clinton Street with an FAR of 16.74. It also had an adjacent 1.5 acre public plaza next door. Because of demand for additional office space at this building, the developer is now seeking to add an additional floor of office to the building, making it 51 floors and to move two smaller floors down lower. So we would be increasing the height from 715 to 730 feet.

We would be increasing the FAR to 78,777 square feet for a total square footage of 1,578,777 square feet. And an FAR of 17.11. In addition, we're seeking to add an additional 2,576 square feet of vacated right-of-way to the net site area for sub area C for a total site area then of 92,286. This additional FAR would require that we provide contributions to the Neighborhood Opportunity Bonus Fund and we'll be paying another $1,070,517 into the FAR Neighborhood Opportunity Fund.

The payment will be divided as was required, 856,000 to the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund, 107,000 to the Citywide Adopt-a-Landmark Fund and another 10% or 107,000 into the Local Impact Fund. There are no other changes are being made to the previously approved office tower. The construction costs of this project is $300 million and will create 1,500 temporary jobs and 6,000 office and retail jobs, as well as generate approximately $17 million annually in real estate taxes.

In addition, the applicant has paid $1.6 million to the city for the vacation of a public right-of-way which was adjoining the applicant's property to square off our site and increase the size of the plaza and park area which is depicted on the slide. Furthermore, the applicant is committed to achieving here to the MBE and WBE participation goals of 26% for MBE and 6% for WBE and has awarded to date $16.7 million in contracts to the city certified MBE contractors and $11.6 million in contracts to city certified WBE contractors. In addition, the applicant has agreed to provide several traffic improvements in the surrounding area that are memorialized in the traffic management plan.

This was something the traffic management plan and this issue of traffic was a central issue for Alderman Riley and for the community. And as the result, we created this traffic management plan and some of the highlights of that include traffic signal and pedestrian countdown signals at specific key intersections, designated taxi and ride share pickup and drop off zones, relocated shuttle bus loading zones. And in addition, the applicant has agreed to compensate the city for a portion of the costs of three traffic control aids and two parking enforcement aids to help traffic operations at key intersections within and adjacent to the plan development during peak AM and peak hours, Monday through Friday.

We believe that this proposed technical amendment to the plan development meets the standards of the Chicago Zoning Ordinance and to the requirements for plan developments. And so on behalf of the applicant, I would respectfully request that you approve and give favorable consideration to this project. Again, I would like to give special thanks to Alderman Riley and the Department of Planning for all the time and work that was put in on this.

Again, Alderman Riley had community meetings and we had extensive community meetings when this was first heard. We've met with him on this particular issue and what's been addressed in this document is in response to his concerns regarding the traffic and also the park and how big the park would be and how it would be improved. I stand ready and Mr. Rafael Pereira from our company is also here to answer any questions that any of you might have concerning this project. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:37:14 - 2:37:21)
Thank you. Alderman Riley, do you wanna give a brief conversation about the community engagement?

[Speaker 3] (2:37:22 - 2:38:49)
Yes, Chairman, and I don't have a long list to read on this one. As a reminder, we all reviewed and approved the broader project some time ago. This is a technical amendment to boil down all those numbers Jack was throwing around there earlier.

They need a little bit more FAR to make the project work and that's why they're back before us. But I think Jack wanted to simply highlight some of those public benefits that were negotiated, but I don't wanna belabor those with this committee given that we've reviewed those once before, but a beautiful park will be delivered in conjunction with this project adjacent to Union Station. And as Jack mentioned, the applicant has also agreed after negotiations with the OMC, the police department and CDOT to make funding commitments to assign traffic control aids to better manage and literally manage the traffic that flows around Union Station.

It is absolute gridlock there today. It requires that extra touch. This project will help deliver that.

I think that's a benefit, not just to the neighborhood, but to the entire city. So for all those reasons, I'd ask you to approve this technical amendment to a very ambitious project. We've already reviewed and approved, but I'd be happy to answer any questions my colleagues might have.

[Speaker 1] (2:38:52 - 2:39:01)
Alderman, let's see. I don't see any questions on that. So can I get a motion move to pass on this item?

[Speaker 20] (2:39:03 - 2:39:05)
Move to pass by Alderman Waguespack.

[Speaker 1] (2:39:05 - 2:39:15)
Alderman Waguespack moves to pass on this item. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Opinion of the chair, the ayes have it, item is passed.

[Speaker 32] (2:39:16 - 2:39:18)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members.

[Speaker 35] (2:39:19 - 2:39:20)
Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:39:20 - 2:40:07)
Okay. Thank you, Chairman. Thank you.

All right, now we're gonna go back. For committee members, the middle of page eight. All right, committee members, we're going back to page eight.

In the middle, the attorney is Mark Kupiec and the document number 20359, 25th Ward, ordinance referred on April 22nd of 2020, common address 2345 through 2353 South Wentworth and the change request, C13 neighborhood commercial district to a C15 neighborhood commercial district. Mark, are you with us? Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you for your patience on this one. We almost got you to a lunch date, but unfortunately, it's afternoon, so.

[Speaker 23] (2:40:07 - 2:41:05)
Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, my name is Mark, I got my camera set up, that's better. Mark Kupiec, I'm an attorney with offices at 77 West Washington, and I represent the applicant, Emmy Wentworth, LLC. The applicant is the owner of the subject property.

This zoning change would provide additional floor area and additional height to allow the applicant to build an upper floor addition to the existing hotel and retail building and allow the applicant to establish a penthouse dwelling unit, one dwelling unit within the proposed upper floor addition. We have provided plans and information to the alderman to begin this project. At his request, we appeared before his advisory committee, explained the project and answered questions.

Afterwards, we followed up with the aldermanic staff. And I do believe, since then, the alderman has sent you his letter of support.

[Speaker 1] (2:41:07 - 2:41:09)
Mark, we do have a letter of support from Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 23] (2:41:10 - 2:41:11)
Ciccio Lopez, your support.

[Speaker 9] (2:41:12 - 2:41:12)
Ciccio Lopez.

[Speaker 1] (2:41:13 - 2:41:23)
Thank you, my vice chair. All right, all right, speaking of Alderman Ciccio Lopez, would you like to comment on this South Wentworth project?

[Speaker 8] (2:41:25 - 2:41:56)
Yeah, thank you, Chairman. So yes, so we reviewed the application with the applicant. We're happy to see more jobs coming to the community, obviously, adhering to, obviously, environmental standards and guidance for local hiring.

So look forward to work with the applicant to bring these jobs to the community and have a good process for local hiring that we badly need across the city. So thank you for the applicant to working with us, and we look forward to continue working with them.

[Speaker 1] (2:41:57 - 2:42:03)
Thank you, Alderman. Alderman, from my understanding, is this like the owner's unit up on the top?

[Speaker 23] (2:42:03 - 2:42:17)
Yes, Mr. Chairman, and the development plan to utilize that. The subject property to the east is the Dan Ryan Expressway. It's got a very nice view of downtown.

So that was his idea behind this penthouse unit.

[Speaker 1] (2:42:17 - 2:42:53)
Thank you. Questions for committee members? Hearing none, can I get a motion?

So moved, Mr. Chairman. Alderman Roboyas moves to pass on the item. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? Opinion Chair, the ayes have it, item is passed.

We're gonna now move again with Mark on document number 20360, 30th Ward. Ordinance was referred on April 22nd of 2020, and the common address 4205 through 4207 West Roscoe. Mark?

[Speaker 23] (2:42:54 - 2:43:43)
Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, my name is Mark Kupiec. I'm an attorney with offices at 77 West Washington. I represent the applicant.

The applicant is the owner of the subject property. And this zoning change will allow the applicant to build a new building. It will be a two-story building, three dwelling unit residential building.

The plan is for a condo building. We had contacted the alderman, submitted our information. He asked for a community meeting.

We did do mail notice for this community meeting. We had the community meeting, explained the project, answered the questions. No objection voiced there.

Followed up with the alderman and the aldermanic staff. And I do believe we have his letter of support, although I believe the alderman's here and didn't speak for himself.

[Speaker 1] (2:43:45 - 2:43:52)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Roboius. Ariel, do you have anything else to comment? Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 28] (2:43:52 - 2:44:04)
As Councilor Kukietz mentioned, there was a community meeting that was held on January 20th that was not objected. And we asked for a favorable support to move forward on the subject matter.

[Speaker 1] (2:44:06 - 2:44:09)
Motion moved. Do I have a motion move to pass on the item?

[Speaker 9] (2:44:11 - 2:44:12)
Alderman Lopez moves to pass.

[Speaker 1] (2:44:13 - 2:44:16)
Alderman Lopez moves to pass on the item. All those in favor?

[Speaker 9] (2:44:17 - 2:44:18)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (2:44:18 - 2:44:29)
Aye. Any opposed? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Thank you, Mark. Thank you. And I think that's it for you, right, Mark?

[Speaker 23] (2:44:29 - 2:44:31)
That is, yes it is, thanks.

[Speaker 1] (2:44:31 - 2:45:05)
Okay, thanks so much for your patience. Now we'll move with Dan Lauer. We're on the top of page nine for our committee members in document number 20368-T1, 25th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on April 22nd of 2020. Common address 2435 to 2437 South Leavitt Street. Change request, RS3, residential single unit detached house district to a B23 neighborhood mixed use district.

[Speaker 22] (2:45:05 - 2:47:08)
Dan. Hi. Good afternoon.

Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. Good to see everybody. This is 2435-37 South Leavitt.

It's application 20368-T1. I represent Malik Bader, B-A-D-E-R, and Nas Bader from a company called Bader Leavitt LLC. And the proposal is RS3 to B23, Mr. Chairman. The Bader brothers purchased this property in a foreclosure sale in November of 2018. It was formerly, and this is going back some years, a SRO. So normally to reduce dwelling units from a higher number to a lower number, in this case, nine dwelling units, it would be easy, but there technically are no dwelling units at this property.

There were only SRO units licensed by the city. There's no longer a pending SRO license. There has been no SRO license for approaching 10 years, it appears.

The property is transit-oriented, since we're within proximity to the Western Avenue bus line. I would like to say thanks to Ana Robles and to Steve Valenciano for working with me on all of these issues. Mr. Bader, Nas Bader, and Malik Bader grew up in Pilsen, and they own numerous other properties, in fact, in Pilsen, Mr. Chairman, including they purchased the St. Anne's Church, which is by 18th and Levitt from the archdiocese, and are rehabbing that to residential. For this building, there'll be no changes to the footprint whatsoever. We met with Alderman Siccio-Lopez's 25th Ward Zoning Advisory Committee and obtained their support. We're very grateful for the assistance of Diego Morales from the 25th Ward and for Alderman Siccio-Lopez's letter of support.

[Speaker 1] (2:47:08 - 2:47:15)
Thank you, Dan. Alderman Siccio-Lopez, would you like to comment on this application?

[Speaker 8] (2:47:17 - 2:48:00)
Thank you, Chairman. Yeah, no, we want to thank the applicant for working with us. I know that the building has been vacant for a while, and there've been concerns, obviously, having a property vacant for so long, so I want to thank the applicant.

I know that they also have worked with us and said that even though they're not required to do affordable housing, they've been working with us to make sure that the rents reflect the areas, average, and work with us to maintain, you know, obviously, the fabric of the community, so I want to thank the applicant for working with us, and we're supporting the project.

[Speaker 1] (2:48:01 - 2:48:34)
Questions for Alderman Siccio-Lopez? So, I have a technical question. In regards to, I've been on the council a fair amount of time.

Would someone from the department explain this SRO issue? Because it was quite a bit of SRO preservation ordinances that we worked hard on. So, this predates all that.

So, can Patrick, can you talk about this?

[Speaker 26] (2:48:34 - 2:48:52)
Yes, Chairman. I have talked with the law department and the Department of Housing, and as Mr. Lauer said, this predated the SRO preservation ordinance, and so it did not apply to the conversion of this specific building.

[Speaker 1] (2:48:54 - 2:49:02)
I'm assuming it was vacant at the time we were, and that license had expired well before we passed that ordinance for preservation.

[Speaker 26] (2:49:03 - 2:49:12)
I can't speak to the vacancy portion of it, but the license that was there was no longer active for this under the rules of the preservation ordinance when it was passed. Okay.

[Speaker 8] (2:49:13 - 2:49:15)
All righty, other questions?

[Speaker 1] (2:49:16 - 2:49:16)
Yeah.

[Speaker 8] (2:49:17 - 2:49:34)
And Chairman, just to add this- Alderman Siccio-Lopez. Yeah, just to add, that's one of the zoning advisory board did check on the SRO regulations, and that's the understanding that the committee had as well. So, I just wanna add that for the record.

[Speaker 1] (2:49:35 - 2:49:51)
Thank you, Alderman Lopez. I know if you had the ability, you would be getting more affordable housing with the SRO in place. But that being said, we have a letter of support from you.

So, can I get a motion to move to pass on the item?

[Speaker 14] (2:49:52 - 2:49:53)
Move to pass.

[Speaker 1] (2:49:53 - 2:50:03)
Move to pass by Alderman Dowell. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Opinion chair, the ayes have it. The item is passed.

Thank you.

[Speaker 22] (2:50:04 - 2:50:08)
And Dan, I think that's it for you. That's it for me. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good to see you.

[Speaker 1] (2:50:08 - 2:50:33)
Okay. Next, we're gonna stay in the 25th ward. Document number 20395, T1, 25th ward, ordinance referred on April 22nd of 2020.

The common address, 2049 West Coulter Street, change request, RS3, residential single unit detached house district to a B2-5 neighborhood mixed use district. Tyler, Tyler Mannick.

[Speaker 19] (2:50:33 - 2:51:56)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Tyler Mannick, attorney for the applicant Midcoast Investments, LLC. The applicant seeks a type one zoning map amendment to rezone 2049 West Coulter from an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to a B2-5 neighborhood mixed use district.

The purpose of the rezoning is to bring the existing nonconforming building into compliance with a zoning district in terms of its bulk and density standards to allow the applicant who also owns the building to make renovations to preserve the existing building and legalize the fourth floor unit of the existing four-story eight-unit building. The applicant is gonna be providing two affordable units as part of this project. And after getting the building permits approved for the renovations, re-downzone it back to its RS3 zoning district.

Prior to filing this application, the applicant met with the Alderman and participated in a meeting with the Zoning Advisory Council for the Alderman. After these meetings, Alderman has kindly given us his letter of support. And with the support of the Alderman, I respectfully request that this committee favorably recommend the passage of the proposed zoning map amendment, and I'd be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (2:51:57 - 2:51:59)
Thank you, Tyler. Alderman Siccio-Lopez. Lopez.

[Speaker 8] (2:52:01 - 2:52:10)
Not just again, thanks applicant we're working with the Zoning Advisory Board and fulfilling the guidelines that we have set up for this particular project. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:52:11 - 2:52:28)
Yes, and we do have a letter of support on file for this application. Any questions for the Alderman or the applicant? Hearing none, do I get a motion?

So moved, Alderman Hatton. Alderman Hatton moves to pass on this item. All those in favor?

Aye.

[Speaker 35] (2:52:28 - 2:52:28)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (2:52:29 - 2:52:35)
Any opposed? Opinion Chair, the ayes have it and the item is passed. Thank you, Tyler.

[Speaker 19] (2:52:35 - 2:52:35)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:52:36 - 2:52:36)
Good afternoon.

[Speaker 19] (2:52:37 - 2:52:37)
You too.

[Speaker 1] (2:52:38 - 2:53:00)
All right, now we're gonna move to document number 20366 in the 28th Ward. The ordinance was referred on April 22nd of 2020. This common address is 4848 West Madison Street and the change request, B32 Community Shopping District to a C12 Neighborhood Commercial District.

Bob Gamareth.

[Speaker 33] (2:53:01 - 2:54:15)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. Rob Gamareth with Burke, Moran, McKay, and Saratella appearing on behalf of the applicant Purely Old Storage and Warehousing LLC. The applicant is seeking a zoning change from the B32 Community Shopping District to the C12 Neighborhood Commercial District.

The property is currently a vacant, former butcher shop focused on retail sales to the public. The applicant purchased the property and is in the wholesale butcher shop business, selling to grocery stores, restaurants, and other wholesale purchasers. The current B32 District limits butcher shops to retail sales and the zoning change to C12 is needed to allow for a wholesale butcher shop.

We are proposing no changes to the building and this is really a textbook adaptive reuse being proposed. We have met with Alderman Urban and local members of the community and the proposed zoning change has been well received. I believe you have a letter of support from Alderman Urban and I saw that Alderman Urban was also present at this meeting.

[Speaker 1] (2:54:16 - 2:54:25)
Thank you. Alderman Urban. Thank you.

Jason?

[Speaker 30] (2:54:28 - 2:54:37)
I'm unmuting. Yes. This project is- West Madison.

Morenoik site, can you hear me?

[Speaker 1] (2:54:38 - 2:54:39)
Yes, we can.

[Speaker 30] (2:54:39 - 2:55:04)
Okay, this project is the former Morenoik site in the 4800 block of Madison that's being repurposed for another meat wholesaler and possibly retail location. We've had conversations with the block club surrounding community support and hopefully we can get this great location on the West side back to productive use and fill in the balance of the 48 and 4900 blocks of West Madison.

[Speaker 1] (2:55:05 - 2:55:08)
Look forward to a favorable consideration from the committee.

[Speaker 30] (2:55:09 - 2:55:10)
And I would answer any questions one may have.

[Speaker 1] (2:55:11 - 2:55:19)
Thank you, Alderman. Questions for the applicant or the Alderman? Hearing none, can I get a motion to move do pass on the item?

[Speaker 9] (2:55:20 - 2:55:21)
Alderman Lopez moves to pass.

[Speaker 1] (2:55:23 - 2:55:26)
Alderman Lopez moves to pass. All those in favor?

[Speaker 35] (2:55:27 - 2:55:27)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (2:55:28 - 2:55:35)
Any opposed? Opinion of the chair of the ayes have it and this item is passed.

[Speaker 30] (2:55:35 - 2:55:36)
Thank you, thank you committee.

[Speaker 1] (2:55:37 - 2:56:04)
Thank you. All right, now we're gonna go to Mr. Moore on document number 20356, 30th Ward, ordinance referred on April 22nd of 2020. Common address is 3051 North Monticello Avenue.

And the change request, RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RT4 residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district.

[Speaker 29] (2:56:06 - 2:57:08)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name for the record is Tom Moore.

This is a single family, four story building that non-conforming the ground floor is, which has always been used as a basement is above ground. And to make it a young family, the O'Connells have moved into it. And they hope to make it their family home and they'd like to renovate and make the basement usable space.

So we've met with Alderman Rebollas and asked him if he would support an RS3 to an RT4 to make this a conforming property. He supported it. The O'Connell shared their plans with their neighbors and we're aware of no opposition.

And we have a letter of support from Alderman Rebollas. We'd appreciate your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (2:57:09 - 2:57:17)
Thank you, Mr. Moore. Alderman Rebollas, would you like to comment on this ambition? We have your letter of support.

That is correct.

[Speaker 28] (2:57:19 - 2:57:33)
Council Moore did state that all they're doing is making the basement of use. The owners live on the property, no expansion of walls or anything. It was not contested by anyone and neighbors.

[Speaker 30] (2:57:33 - 2:57:35)
So I asked for your favorable support.

[Speaker 1] (2:57:37 - 2:57:42)
Thank you. Thank you, Alderman. Questions for the applicant or Alderman Rebollas?

[Speaker 28] (2:57:44 - 2:57:49)
And before I ask- Chairman, is Mr. Thomas Moore? I didn't recognize him.

[Speaker 29] (2:57:51 - 2:57:58)
Well, two months without him. This is the first time I wore a suit in two months. Good for you.

[Speaker 1] (2:57:59 - 2:58:07)
Yeah, I didn't recognize you either. I think we have Alderman Lopez on a question.

[Speaker 9] (2:58:09 - 2:58:30)
Thank you, Chairman. This is actually for council. I wanted to make sure that he had his customary tie on for this zoning committee.

Perfect. Just had to make sure we were not losing tradition here. Thank you, Chairman.

With that, I move to pass if there's no other. All right. Alderman Lopez has a motion move to pass on the item.

[Speaker 1] (2:58:30 - 2:58:34)
All those in favor? Aye. Aye.

Aye.

[Speaker 21] (2:58:34 - 2:58:35)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (2:58:39 - 2:59:23)
This type of application, Alderman Osterman and I have been working with the Department of Planning and Housing and many of you on trying to rectify these zoning applications, less of a burden actually on the applicant and the property owners. So we look forward to working with you, Alderman Osterman. Next, we're still with Mr. Moore, but we're now in the 47th ward on document number 20351. The ordinance in the 47th was introduced or referred on April 22nd of 2020 townhouse and multi-unit district. Mr. Moore. Thank you.

[Speaker 29] (2:59:24 - 2:59:48)
My name for the record is Tom Moore. And this application you, Mr. Chairman, we're just talking about, this is a existing four-story building as is three legal apartments. But this application is to allow the build out and the permitting of the ground floor for a fourth apartment and the support as well.

[Speaker 1] (2:59:50 - 3:00:05)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Martin. Any questions for the applicant? Can I get a motion?

Motion moved by Alderman Roboyes. Okay. All right.

[Speaker 9] (3:00:05 - 3:00:06)
We'll see.

[Speaker 1] (3:00:06 - 3:00:20)
Now we're moving to document number 2098, 36th ward. Ordinance was referred on April 22nd of 2020. The two flat townhouse and multi-unit district.

Warren Silver.

[Speaker 31] (3:00:22 - 3:01:24)
Good morning. Good afternoon. Warren.

Warren Silver from Silver Law Office, P.R. Valo. She is the owner of a brick bungalow that she purchased in 2015 from a builder who had added a second floor addition. Unfortunately and unbeknownst to her, missed necessary permits.

And when she went to apply for a permit to do a fence, she found this out and is seeking to correct that. In order to do so, were RT 3.5 to accommodate the floor area of the addition. Once approved, assuming that this committee and the city council approves the request, we will also need an administrative adjustment to confirm the previously existing first floor walls.

We've been in communication with Alderman Villegas' office. Alderman Villegas has transmitted to the committee.

[Speaker 1] (3:01:25 - 3:01:29)
Warren, you have his letter of support. Lopez on a question.

[Speaker 9] (3:01:31 - 3:01:42)
Thank you, Chairman. Was this property purchased as by the applicant with these, is that what I heard? With these additions?

[Speaker 31] (3:01:44 - 3:01:57)
Everything that's existing now had already been built out when she was shown the property and decided to purchase it. She had no idea that the addition had been built without permits.

[Speaker 9] (3:01:57 - 3:02:00)
So was there a zoning that was attached to her sale?

[Speaker 31] (3:02:00 - 3:02:16)
Well, it was a single family home and the zoning certificate. I have not seen it because I did not represent her in the purchase, but I presume that since it's a single, that it just showed a single on the certificate of zoning compliance.

[Speaker 9] (3:02:17 - 3:02:44)
The reason I ask, and you know, Chairman, that this is something that's been brought up. And I think that as you and Chairman Osterman are pursuing the ADU, the people purchasing homes, thinking that they bought one thing and only to find out that they're zoning or what's on the books is something completely different so that they don't have to keep coming to this committee for adjustments and zoning corrections. When they're purchasing, we should be able to work with them a little easier.

That's all.

[Speaker 1] (3:02:45 - 3:02:51)
Thank you, Alderman. Other questions? Do I get a motion?

[Speaker 9] (3:02:53 - 3:02:55)
Do I get a motion? Motion to pass. Don't move.

[Speaker 1] (3:02:56 - 3:02:57)
All those in favor?

[Speaker 9] (3:02:57 - 3:02:58)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (3:02:58 - 3:03:26)
Any opposed? Opinion Chair, the ayes have it. And the item is passed.

Thank you, Warren. All right. Now, for our committee members, top of it, document number 20363, 38th Ward.

Ordinance was referred out of 2020. Common address, 4801 North Austin Avenue. Change request.

Be for Jonathan Wolf.

[Speaker 19] (3:03:26 - 3:04:11)
Yes, can you hear me okay? Yes. Great, thank you.

And good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the zoning committee. My name is Jonathan Wolf and this is Virgil Maceo brewing craft beer in 2017. We are seeking to change the zoning of 4801 North Austin from E3-1 to C1-2.

The purpose of the zoning change is to have appropriate zoning to height of 17 feet and a footprint of 1,455 square feet. We have no plans to alter the exterior of the building except for improvements such as windows, tuck pointing and painting. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Nick Sposato and respectfully ask the committee's approval on this zoning change.

[Speaker 1] (3:04:14 - 3:04:27)
All right. Thank you. Questions?

We do have a letter of support from Alderman Sposato. Questions for the applicant? We do not have anything to post up.

[Speaker 20] (3:04:27 - 3:04:30)
That's all right. I'll just look it up.

[Speaker 1] (3:04:30 - 3:04:35)
We do not, but I think we had in our pre-meeting, did we not?

[Speaker 25] (3:04:35 - 3:04:36)
Yeah, we did bring it up.

[Speaker 1] (3:04:36 - 3:04:51)
So you know what it is. What is it? Does it exist?

Let's ask the applicant. I think this is existing building, no changes. If I'm not mistaken, it was a one story building?

[Speaker 22] (3:04:52 - 3:04:53)
Correct sir, yes.

[Speaker 19] (3:04:53 - 3:05:03)
A 17 foot building. It was formerly a restaurant that had changed hands numerous times in the past four or five years. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (3:05:04 - 3:05:05)
And no parking?

[Speaker 20] (3:05:06 - 3:05:06)
No sir.

[Speaker 1] (3:05:07 - 3:05:10)
Okay. All right. Alderman Waguespack, are you okay?

[Speaker 20] (3:05:12 - 3:05:28)
Yeah, I was just curious because I have a brewery that has almost the similar kind of layout with no parking and kind of squeezed into a tight wedge shape building. So I was just curious how they were handling some of that, but I'm all good. No other questions.

[Speaker 1] (3:05:28 - 3:05:31)
All right. Can I get a motion then on this item?

[Speaker 20] (3:05:32 - 3:05:34)
Move to pass by Alderman Waguespack.

[Speaker 1] (3:05:35 - 3:05:48)
Moves to pass on the item. All those in favor? Aye.

Aye. Any opposed? Chair, the ayes have it.

Item is passed. Thank you very much. Skip the next item.

[Speaker 35] (3:05:48 - 3:05:48)
Thank you.

[Speaker 25] (3:05:49 - 3:05:50)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:05:52 - 3:06:42)
One out of order here. We're gonna move to the bottom of page 11. And this is document number 20228, 47th Ward.

Ordinance was referred on October 16th of teen. Common address, 3246 through 360 North Campbell Avenue, 2500 to 2546 West Melrose, 3237 through 34 change request. Institutional plan development number 1184 and RS2 residential single unit district to a C11 and then to institutional plan development number 1184 as amended for my colleagues.

This was the DeVry site that we'll hear from Liz Butler.

[Speaker 10] (3:06:47 - 3:08:06)
Thank you. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Liz Butler from the law firm of DLA Piper located at 444 West Leak Street in Chicago.

And I represent the applicant in this matter, DePaul College Prep Foundation, who is the applicant for a PD amendment for the property located at this series of addresses, 3300 North Campbell Avenue. The applicant is seeking to rezone the property from its current institutional plans development number 1184 and RS2 to a unified C11 district and then to institutional plan development number 1184 as amended in order to incorporate new property into the plan development at the North and to eliminate sub area boundaries. And finally to facilitate the phased addition of new campus facilities to serve the high school.

This PD amendment was considered and recommended for approval by the Chicago plan commission on May 8th, 2020. And we would request that the transcript of those proceedings and the resolution from the plan commission be incorporated into the record here today.

[Speaker 1] (3:08:08 - 3:08:23)
Alderman Siccio Lopez moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Sitting in the chair, the ayes have it. The records are now incorporated.

Carry on Liz.

[Speaker 10] (3:08:23 - 3:10:41)
Thank you. DePaul College Prep is a high performing nonprofit co-ed college prep high school that serves grades nine through 12. It currently operates at 3633 North California Avenue.

In response to rapidly growing enrollment, DePaul College Prep acquired the approximately 17 acre campus that you see here, including the two modern school buildings located at 3300 North Campbell. As the chairman mentioned, this is the former DeVry campus. DePaul plans to move its operations to the new campus this summer, July, 2020.

And the proposed PD amendment will allow DePaul to relocate and to upgrade and enhance the campus with new modern facilities, including expanding its athletic facilities. The campus currently has these two modern academic buildings that you see here. The applicant is proposing to construct a new two-story athletic building and to replace a portion of the surface parking lot with the installation of an athletic turf field at the northeast of the site.

Replacing the surface parking lot with a turf field will reduce the overall campus parking from 610 spaces to 413, which is more than sufficient to accommodate DePaul faculty, students, and visitors. The applicant presented the proposed development at a community meeting hosted by the 47th board in March, 2020. DePaul has also engaged with community partners, its immediate neighbors, academic partners, and local chambers of commerce over the last 18 months.

All of the community partners are enthusiastically supportive of the campus relocation and the proposed development. The applicant has worked closely with Alderman Martin and the Department of Planning and Development and the Department of Transportation on this project. We understand that the alderman is in support of this plan development amendment and has provided a letter to that effect to the committee.

We respectfully request that you recommend city council approval of the application. We appreciate your time and consideration of this matter, and I'm available to answer any questions that you may have.

[Speaker 1] (3:10:42 - 3:11:50)
Thank you. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Martin. We have questions, comments from any of our committee members.

Hearing none, I just wanted to make a comment and or compliment, and I know that former library commissioner, Mary Dempsey, this is her major project, and she spoke very eloquently about the school, its diversity, its students from all over the city. It's an amazing project. I still don't know how we can afford it, but if anyone can get it done, it's Mary Dempsey.

So it's a handsome redo. Obviously, DeVry has its own set of issues. I think they're downtown now, if I'm not mistaken, Liz.

The campus of DeVry has moved downtown, is that correct? Right. Okay.

Right.

[Speaker 10] (3:11:51 - 3:12:11)
Mr. Chair, if I could, one point of order. I believe that we have a substitute ordinance that we would ask the committee to pass on. The change to the ordinance was a request that the ordinance be effective upon passage rather than upon publication.

And I think that we heard from the department that that would be acceptable.

[Speaker 1] (3:12:12 - 3:12:30)
So that would be requested. Let me ask Patrick if we have a substitute basically allowing this to move forward immediately after it passes the full city council. Is that correct, Patrick?

[Speaker 26] (3:12:32 - 3:12:36)
I am checking that right now. I will get right back to you, chairman.

[Speaker 30] (3:12:36 - 3:12:38)
We do in the mayor's office.

[Speaker 26] (3:12:39 - 3:12:42)
Yeah. Oh, then, okay. I heard Nicole then.

[Speaker 36] (3:12:44 - 3:12:45)
Okay, then you have it.

[Speaker 1] (3:12:46 - 3:13:09)
So I guess, is Nicole the enforcer now? I'm gonna have to wait to see what the mayor's office says about that. But no, I think we've been made aware and Liz, thank you for bringing it to the attention.

So we will, first of all, ask to move the substitute. And I explained what the substitute is. Can I get a motion to move on the substitute?

[Speaker 28] (3:13:09 - 3:13:10)
So moved, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (3:13:11 - 3:13:48)
That is Alderman Ravoyos, I believe moved the substitute. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? All right, so we're on the that has been made part of the record, Liz. And before I ask for a motion on the amended ordinance, I know it's separate from this application.

But as we said, DeVry is downtown. What do you know of anything that's gonna happen with the Gordon Tech or DePaul campus over there on California, I believe? I didn't know that.

[Speaker 10] (3:13:50 - 3:14:02)
So DePaul currently is a tenant and their lease will end and they'll move out and it will revert back to current ownership. I'm not aware of what the future plans are for the current campus.

[Speaker 1] (3:14:03 - 3:15:15)
Okay, all right, thank you. All right, so with that, can I get a motion to move to pass on the amended- Motion moved. Ordinance.

Motion moved to pass. Is that Alderman Cardona? Yes.

Thank you, Alderman. Alderman Cardona moves do pass on the ordinance. All those in favor?

Aye. Aye. Aye.

Any opposed? Opinion in the chair of the ayes have it. And this item is approved as amended and revised.

Thank you, thank you, Liz. Thank you. All right.

Thank you. Now we're gonna move back to with Harlan Powell on item number 20355, 43rd Ward. Ordinance was referred on April 22nd of 2020.

The common address, 1959 North Halsted Street and the change request. A B3-2 Community Shopping District to a C1-2 Neighborhood Commercial District. Harlan Powell.

Hi, can you hear me? We can hear you, thank you.

[Speaker 17] (3:15:15 - 3:17:19)
Thank you very much. I lost my video and I think I'm restarting right now. But here we go.

Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Harlan Powell. I'm an attorney with the law firm of Powell Junior PC located at 230 West Huron Street here in Chicago.

I'm appearing today on behalf of the applicant Janine's Wine Bar LLC, the owner of the subject property. As you mentioned, Mr. Chair, the subject property is currently zoned as a B3-2 Community Shopping District. The applicant seeks to rezone the property to C1-2 Neighborhood Commercial District.

The applicant currently operates a wine bar at the neighboring address just to the North 1961 North Halsted. It holds a tavern license to facilitate its operations at this address. The applicant is seeking the zoning change here today to accommodate the expansion of its tavern license to cover both addresses.

A zoning change is needed because the City of Chicago Liquor Dealers Ordinance Section 4-60-020 prohibits the issuance of tavern licenses in any B3 zone within 400 feet of an existing tavern. And here there are two existing taverns within 400 feet of the applicant's premises. The zoning change to C1-2 would effectively address this issue.

As mentioned, the property is located in the 43rd Ward and the applicant has received the support of Alderman Smith who I believe provided a letter via email earlier this week to the committee. We also had a community meeting co-hosted by the Alderman and Lincoln Central Association last week. The Lincoln Central Association did express its support.

The immediate neighbors have expressed their support and we are aware of no objections to the zoning change. I'm obviously available for any questions the committee might have. With that, I respectfully request your favorable recommendation on this matter.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:17:20 - 3:17:31)
Thank you, Harlan. I know we have a letter of support from Alderman Smith, but she's also on the line because she's super excited about this one. So Alderman Michelle Smith.

[Speaker 25] (3:17:31 - 3:18:26)
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I wanted to appear live at this meeting to express my support and ask for the vote of my colleagues in support of the zoning change. This wine bar called the J9 Wine Bar is a solely owned business by a woman who grew up in our ward and started this business to honor her family who owned this building for a very, very long time.

It's been very, very successful. Maybe some of you have been there and they are actually expanding into the neighboring building. In these times, we're very, very grateful for an individual willing to make this kind of investment in our community and someone who has been a really terrific operator.

So I wanted to call and express my support and invite everyone to come on in when these times change and hope that you will pass this zoning change. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (3:18:27 - 3:18:38)
Thank you, Alderman Smith. Questions for the applicant or the Alderman? I see Alderman Ray Lopez.

Alderman.

[Speaker 9] (3:18:39 - 3:19:15)
Thank you again, Chairman. I just had a question. First off, I think it's great for Alderman Smith to be able to expand and build on a local business.

But I had a question with regards to, in light of everything going on now with COVID-19, how does this change your expansion plan? Because I'm assuming that you didn't have the issues of social distancing and things of that nature in mind when you apply for this. How is that gonna change your dynamic moving forward?

And is that gonna have a negative impact on your expansion, having to distance people further in your new enterprise?

[Speaker 1] (3:19:16 - 3:19:48)
Well- Harlan, before you answer that, obviously you're the lawyer, you're not the proprietor, but it sounded like from Michelle Smith's narrative, they've owned this institution, so to speak, for a long period of time. And while these are very unique times, people are gonna have to adapt and sometimes having a larger space might actually work better so we can socially distance more. But maybe I said too much.

Harlan, do you wanna add to that? Or Michelle?

[Speaker 17] (3:19:48 - 3:20:29)
No, you hit that very much right on the head, Mr. Chair. The expansion will actually be of a benefit to the applicant because it does allow for extra square footage. Whenever the final guidelines are issued for reopening hospitality venues, obviously they'll adhere to those to the letter, but this additional square footage, and we're talking about approximately an additional 3,600 square feet in the adjoining building, will allow for adequate social distancing and any other measures that may be put into place.

So it's kind of an opportune thing for us.

[Speaker 9] (3:20:31 - 3:20:53)
That's great. I'm just curious to see how all businesses are responding. And I think to both of your points, it's quite opportune.

3,600 square feet should allow you to have maybe three extra tables by the time we're done with our guidelines. Okay, four tables. All right.

Happy to support. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (3:20:53 - 3:20:56)
Thank you. All right, with that, can I get a motion to move to pass on the item?

[Speaker 18] (3:20:57 - 3:20:59)
Alderman Hopkins moves to pass.

[Speaker 1] (3:20:59 - 3:21:17)
Alderman Brian Hopkins moves to pass on the item. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Opinions share the eyes have it. And I think maybe the winery might be able to get bottles to go, I think under the order, maybe.

[Speaker 25] (3:21:18 - 3:21:19)
They're doing it right now.

[Speaker 1] (3:21:19 - 3:21:27)
I will have to go purchase it, Alderman. We will not be getting any freebies from that. The restaurants can't afford it anyways, right?

[Speaker 25] (3:21:27 - 3:21:29)
That's right. No, they're already doing to go.

[Speaker 1] (3:21:29 - 3:21:33)
Go on their website, Jayne. All right, all right. Thanks, Alderman.

[Speaker 25] (3:21:33 - 3:21:34)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (3:21:34 - 3:22:13)
We have one more item and then we will go through the sign. So we've got one more item and I'll read that in, but before we adjourn, we're gonna have to go through the sign list, which is not that extensive. So it should be just a few minutes longer.

So we are going to go document number 20382 in the 27th ward ordinance was referred on April 22nd of 2020. Common address is 1152 West Randolph Street. Change request C13 neighborhood commercial district to a DX3 downtown mixed use district.

[Speaker 10] (3:22:14 - 3:22:17)
And committee members will find this on the bottom of page 16.

[Speaker 1] (3:22:18 - 3:22:26)
Okay. Everyone else will find it on page nine. So then we have John Escobar as the attorney.

[Speaker 7] (3:22:27 - 3:23:05)
Hi, good afternoon. Good afternoon, Chairman, members of the committee. I'm attorney John Escobar from the law office of Tristan and Cervantes located at 150 North Wacker Drive, suite 1550 on behalf of the applicant, Quaz LLC.

Also participating in this meeting is the founding partner and legal counsel for the applicant attorney, Homero Tristan. Chairman, before I proceed, note that the architect for this project is currently locked out of this meeting and will likely be testifying today. Her name is Jamie Magaluf from a steep architecture studio.

[Speaker 1] (3:23:07 - 3:23:12)
Are you asking to her to speak on behalf of this?

[Speaker 7] (3:23:14 - 3:23:17)
Eventually she will, if that's possible to allow her into this meeting.

[Speaker 1] (3:23:18 - 3:23:26)
Well, why don't we get through the presentation? We'll hear from the alderman and then we'll see whether we need additional information before.

[Speaker 7] (3:23:27 - 3:24:44)
Okay, thank you, Chairman. And so also following this meeting is the applicant member, Brian Zisis from Quaz LLC. As I mentioned, the principal architect, Jamie Magaluf of steep architecture studio, the owner, Peter Miller of the property who was agreeable to this amendment and did provide a written authorization and it is part of the file that was submitted.

Janae Moreno is also a senior advisor. And Homero Tristan, as I previously mentioned. So the applicant is proposing to establish a DX3 type one zoning change.

The proposed amendment is a change from the current C13 district to a DX3 zoning district to establish and comply with the zoning requirements to operate an adult use cannabis dispensary at the subject property, 1152 West Randolph. In Chicago for the record and updated narrative plans amended to be a type one zoning amendment was submitted. And I asked that the item be amended to a type one application and that the type one narrative and plans be entered into and incorporated into this record.

[Speaker 1] (3:24:45 - 3:24:51)
John, we're gonna ask the department Ana Robles. Do we have the type one?

[Speaker 10] (3:24:55 - 3:25:00)
Ana Robles, yes, we do have the type one. And he amended the application as a type one.

[Speaker 1] (3:25:01 - 3:25:08)
Okay, so that's a, we're gonna need a motion to accept the substitute for a type one amendment.

[Speaker 14] (3:25:09 - 3:25:10)
I'll move chairman.

[Speaker 1] (3:25:10 - 3:25:24)
Moved by Alderman Dowell, all those in favor? Aye. Aye.

Any opposed? All right, hearing none, the item is amended to a type one application. John, continue.

[Speaker 7] (3:25:25 - 3:28:47)
Thank you, chairman. The property is currently comprised of a rectangular shaped land parcel that is improved with a two story mixed use commercial residential masonry building on a lot area of 4,985 square feet containing four dwelling units and four off street parking spaces. Aside from the interior build out of the subject space, no new construction is proposed or required.

Aye. The layouts will be compliant with the requirements of the state of Illinois and in accordance to the updated type one narrative and plans that was submitted to the board and entered into the record. There will be no change to the floor area ratio.

The building height is 35 feet three inches and the applicant will seek special use as per Chicago zoning ordinance requirement under section 17-3-0200. The applicant's intent is, as I mentioned, to locate and establish this adult use cannabis dispensary within the first floor and the basement of the existing property. For reference, the applicant currently operates dispensary 33, which is a medical cannabis and recreational adult use dispensary located at 5001 North Clark, which was the first medical cannabis dispensary to open in Chicago in 2015 and remains one of the few local Chicago owned and operated shops in the city and one of the only minority and woman owned cannabis dispensary in the state.

The applicant intends and is committed to meet the goals of the city's Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection by employing a workforce representative of the city in which it's located and operating with employees, which will include staff members and managers from a wide array of minority groups with local routes specifically to Chicago. The advocate will operate also consistent with the applicable city of Chicago and state of Illinois regulatory rules and guidelines for the storage, dispensing and destruction of cannabis and other related activities. The applicant will operate within and pursuant to the state ordinance for dispensaries, allowing operation for up to seven days a week from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. and will accommodate regulators and other authorities for inspections, as well as shipment and delivery schedules. The applicant has met and garnered support of multiple local community groups and has held multiple community meetings regarding this specific project and zoning amendment. The applicant further has met with and conferred with the alderman on multiple occasions regarding the project. We have not obtained a letter of support at this point, but believe the alderman is not opposed to the amendment.

I'd like to thank the committee for their time and we respectfully request that the committee give a favorable consideration to an approval of this application. Thank you and we're happy to answer any questions at this point.

[Speaker 1] (3:28:48 - 3:29:07)
Thank you, John. Alderman Burnett's still on the call, I know. Alderman, do you wanna speak first?

I think we have another, Alderman Riley's back. He wants to ask a question. What's your preference, Alderman Burnett?

[Speaker 11] (3:29:08 - 3:29:12)
So Mr. Chairman, I prefer to acquiesce to any questions.

[Speaker 3] (3:29:13 - 3:29:20)
Okay, Alderman Riley. I guess, thank you, Chairman. I guess the most important question is, does Alderman Burnett support this application?

[Speaker 1] (3:29:22 - 3:29:30)
Okay, any other questions? Okay, Walter, it's your turn.

[Speaker 11] (3:29:30 - 3:30:02)
Okay, so Mr. Chairman, we had a community meeting last night with the community. To my surprise, it seemed like everybody in the community smoked weed because they all had experience with this place, with the former place who testified. But anyway, the community are in support of it.

This is one of the few marijuana dispensaries that have come before me. The first one that needs a zoning change, for one, in my ward.

[Speaker 9] (3:30:04 - 3:30:06)
Sorry about that.

[Speaker 11] (3:30:06 - 3:30:59)
But also, the only one that, the only one that have come to me with an African-American partner, and they're incorporating the African-American partner into their plans. Janae, I know, is on the phone, well, maybe on the Zoom. She's gonna be a partner in it.

We had a long discussion about it. Of course, for anyone to have an African-American partner or have a partner, period, they have to buy in. And she put all her money together to buy in to be a partner in this.

I'm satisfied with it. The community is satisfied with it. They look to have people work on the construction from the community.

And also, they will hire people from the community also. I have no problem with it. I'm in support of this development.

[Speaker 1] (3:31:01 - 3:31:34)
Thank you all. Thank you, Alderman. Any more questions?

I get a motion to move to pass. Move to pass, Alderman Riley. Alderman Riley moves to pass on the item as amended.

All those in favor? All those in favor? Aye.

Aye. Okay, any opposed? Hearing none, the item is passed as amended.

Thank you very much. Thank you, John.

[Speaker 7] (3:31:35 - 3:31:35)

[Speaker 1] (3:31:36 - 3:34:08)
