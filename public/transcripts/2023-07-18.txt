[Speaker 1] (11:49 - 12:59)
I'm your chair, it is 10 10am on July 18th, 2023, and I call this meeting of the Chicago City Council's Committee on zoning landmarks and building standards to order. We will start off with the roll call committee members please note that your yes or present response will be deemed to be a yes vote. When this quorum roll call is used as a reference vote for later items.

Vice Chair Lawson, Alderman La Spada, Alderman Hopkins, Alderman Dowell, Alderman Hall, Alderman Harris, Alderman Beal, Alderman Ramirez, Alderman Moore. Thank you. Alderman Mosley, Alderman Ciccio-Lopez, Alderman Fuentes, Alderman Burnett, Alderman Cruz, Alderman Conway, Alderman Villegas, Alderman Riley, Alderman Knudson, Alderwoman Clay.

So that is 11 members and we have a quorum so we can proceed. We will now move on to the, well, first we have public comment.

[Speaker 27] (13:02 - 13:15)
So, we have Mr. George Blakemore. Good morning to the citizens of the city of Chicago.

[Speaker 12] (13:16 - 16:13)
I have a title, and my title is, I am a concerned citizen. I was appalled to read, you know, they say reading is fundamental. They say that you have 30 minutes overall for the public participation.

And both subject modification in a reasonable, non-discriminatory way. But they leave this up to the chair. You're not supposed to have that power, that discretion.

You can let one person speak over three minutes and another person speak. You don't need that power. And the same thing when it comes to the ultimate sign and all.

The ultimate. Lady Life will say she's going to take this power away from you. It should be taken because you abused it.

You abused the system. Even if Solis was very corrupt but not as corrupt as you all trying to challenge the people. If you got 15 items or 20 items down there as a concerned citizen, and any citizen, you should be able to speak on that item.

And you don't have to live in that ward. It's pay to play here. Pay to play in the zoning committee.

If you got money, you can make an irregular lot regular. It's pay to play. As far as corrupt, all of these.

In a few minutes, it's going to tell me, bee, bee, bee, bee, bee, your three minutes is up. She tried to change this. Well, who are you all for?

I can give you money and then you can sign off. You don't need that power. We need to change this system to a management, a manager to come in, to manage this thing.

It's out of control what you political have. All of you, you're black ones, you're white ones, you Asian ones, you Hispanic, all of them. I'm appalled.

They say they don't hear you. Oh, yes, they do. They play like they don't hear me.

They listen. I'm appalled. You're a disgrace.

You all hooked this up specifically for Mr. Blakemore, the power of one. We're going to silence him. I will sign up on all of them.

I have this right. You know what happened to Marie Antoinette? The people got tired of that.

Tired of it. Over in France with the French Revolution. Man, I'm going to be sick.

[Speaker 1] (16:15 - 16:37)
Thank you so much, Mr. Blakemore. We will now hear from Daniel Rosenbaum, who will be speaking on an item on the 1400 block of West Fillmore. And while we make as we wait for Mr. Rosenbaum, we are joined by Alderman Knudson. So we will mark you present for the quorum.

[Speaker 9] (16:47 - 19:51)
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen of the Chicago City Committee on Zoning and Landmarks and Buildings. I stand before you today as a concerned resident of the 1400 block of West Fillmore, located in Chicago's Little Italy neighborhood. I'm here to express my strong opposition to the proposed construction of a 50 unit building at 1434 through 1446 West Fillmore in 60607 zip code.

1400 block of West Fillmore with its charming two and three flats has a unique character that the residents hold dear. I believe this proposed development is currently constituted is fundamentally out of character for our community and unfortunately poses significant safety risks. I have serious concerns about the strain this development would place on our already congested infrastructure.

As the 1400 block of West Fillmore is often used as a de facto bypass to the very busy West Taylor Street corridor. Adding 50 additional families and their vehicles to this block without significant accommodations would exacerbate these issues, leading to further inconvenience, frustration, and potential safety hazards. Speaking of safety, I would be remiss not to address the concerns that I have regarding the welfare of our children.

The STEM Academy at Fillmore and Laughlin is a vital aspect of our neighborhood. Many of the students attending the school rely on walking along Fillmore to get to and from class. Introducing a significant increase in traffic with a large influx of new cars in such close proximity to our young students raises legitimate worries about their safety.

We ought not to compromise the well-being of our children for the sake of development. The prospect of increased vehicular activity and limited space for pedestrians poses a significant risk that we cannot afford to overlook. It's our duty as a community to prioritize the well-being of our residents, especially those most vulnerable amongst us.

Our children deserve a safe and nurturing environment to learn and grow. We must ensure that their paths to school are not fraught with unnecessary dangers. Ladies and gentlemen, I urge you to consider the profound impact this proposed development would have on our beloved community.

Our opposition to this development is not born out of resistance to progress, but rather a deep-rooted desire to preserve the character, infrastructure, and safety of our neighborhood. We respectfully request that you reconsider the construction of this 50-unit building on the 1400 block of West Fillmore. Let's work together to find alternative solutions that respect the character of our community, maintain our infrastructure's integrity, and most importantly, safeguard the well-being of our children.

By doing so, we can continue to foster the vibrant spirit and tight-knit community that defines Little Italy. Thank you for your consideration.

[Speaker 1] (19:51 - 21:58)
Thank you so much, Mr. Rosenbaum. That concludes public comment. We will now move on to the approval of the Rule 45 reports containing the minutes of the June hearing of the Committee on Zoning, Landmark, and Building Standards.

All members of this committee should have received an electronic copy of this report, and if hearing no objections, do I have a motion by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum to approve the minutes? I move. Alderman Conway makes a motion.

Any objections? Hearing no objections, the report has been approved. All right, moving on, we will now hear the items to be deferred.

I will read the page number, the file number, the address, and then take a motion for all at the end. On page 9, file number 22168 for the address commonly known as 1754 North Palina Street. On page 13, file number 22129 for the address commonly known as 1938-42 West 63rd Street.

Staying on page 13, file number 22223 for the address commonly known as 2714 West St. Helen Street. All of page 14, which contains file number 22205 for the address commonly known as 1633-49 North Halsted Street. File number 22204 for the address commonly known as 116-138 South Palina.

File number 22206 for the address commonly known as 301 South Damon Avenue and 1800-1853 West Jackson Boulevard. And file number 22203 for the area bounded by West Leland, North Hamlin, North Mondale, and West Wilson Avenue. Lastly, on page 15, file number 22216 for the address commonly known as 1551-1553 North Costner Avenue.

If there are no questions by committee members, Vice Chair Lawson makes a motion to defer the previously listed items by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Are there any objections? Hearing no objections, the items have been deferred.

So we will start off today with the addendum to the agenda. The first item on the addendum is Mayoral Introduction Document Ordinance 2023-0001460, the amendment of the Municipal Code Chapter 17-12, 17-15, 17-17, and ancillary chapters regarding vintage signs. We have our Zoning Administrator, Mr. Patrick Murphy here to give us a presentation on this ordinance. And we will turn it over to him and his lovely PowerPoint.

[Speaker 3] (22:01 - 31:46)
Good morning, Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Patrick Murphy with the Department of Planning and Development. I'm here to discuss the proposed changes, as the Chairman said, to Chapters 17 and 12 in the Chicago Municipal Code as it relates to a variety of signage regulations, which I will go through on the PowerPoint up above.

The proposed standards would address a number of different signage aspects to the Municipal Code, including the introduction of the allowance for the designation of vintage signs. First, I will run through a handful of smaller changes that were discussed last week in the briefings and are detailed in the various sections that are referenced on the screen up above. As it relates to murals, this ordinance is proposing to extract some of the more strict language as it relates to the interpretation and application of messages on murals themselves.

Speaking plainly, this looks at the sides of buildings. Murals are painted in these cases or these examples that exist. And currently, the regulations would require that any square footage referenced or associated with activities that are taking place within those businesses would then trigger the mural to count towards signage and would therefore either be restricted or required to be heavily reduced in square footage.

This proposed change, provided there is not a direct reference to a commercial message related to the business or a specific product being sold by name-brand, would allow for these more vague murals to be provided. Secondarily, we're also matching the definitions of commercial message between the Building Code and the Zoning Code. There were some deviations that have just evolved over time.

This proposes just to clean up and provide the same terminology for both sections of the Municipal Code. Secondarily, regarding sign messages, Section 2 references a specific definition of painted wall signs. And going forward, the smallest box that can be drawn around the elements of the sign exclusive of solid background colors will now allow for greater flexibility on the presence of painted wall signs by excluding some of the perimeter coloring that currently would count towards their square footage.

In regards to high-rise signage, there have been two significant changes to the High-Rise Sign Code over the last five years. They allowed for, one, the consolidation and a better orientation of square footages as it relates to size of signs on heights of buildings. And we cleaned up how signage regulations are applied along the Chicago River.

Secondarily, just about a year and a half ago, additional requirements were put on tenancy allowances that could result in two high-rise signs being established on a building. Today, we're proposing to take the former allowances that disregarded tenancy size and remove those from the High-Rise Code. There are high-rise signs that were established prior to 2007 when tenancy requirements came into effect.

This, going forward, would now require those relabeling of signs, refacing of those signs, to all follow the same rules as other signs that have been established since 2007. Pardon? Example?

Okay, so example. Chase Bank, for instance. This sign has taken on a number of iterations, Bank One, Bank Chicago, over the last number of years.

That sign is too large for the height that it is above grade. It's about 30-some-odd square feet larger than it would be allowed. So were a new tenant to come into this facility where there was no tenancy and different size controls at the time, they would be held to the tenancy requirements that exist for every other sign, meaning a new tenant would have to achieve the occupancy within the building or fall under principal tenant allowances in order to reface that sign.

Moving on to some other things that were more of, like I said, a non-substantive language cleanup. There were section references as well as the inclusion of various references to vintage signs, which I will get to next, that were simply added into the appropriate text so that the ordinance reads appropriately and references people who are using it to the appropriate sections with the appropriate terminology. The changes highlighted on this slide do not represent any real substantive changes.

They are simply a matter of formatting and making sure people can find the information correctly. So now getting to vintage signs. Over a number of years, we've been approached by various elected officials, applicants, people in the community about retention of signs that otherwise should be removed for a variety of non-conforming reasons.

Up to this point, we have not had a mechanism in order to entertain those in order to find a way to preserve those. Working with Chairman Rosa last fall, there was a project in his ward that had come forward that was very interested, both from the applicant standpoint, the alderman, and the community in retaining. So we worked with the Historic Preservation Division of our department and the law department and the building department, and we proposed this ordinance that would give a pathway to preserve these signs, provided that they achieve a level of explanation as far as the historic nature that they serve to a particular community, particularly commercial corridors, and that they include a maintenance and repair plan that would allow for the proper restoration and attachment of the sign to the building. This applies only to signs that exist today. So this would not be an avenue to reestablish signs that have been formally taken down.

In regards to the specifics of the application, in instances where the building owner and the sign owner are different entities or individuals, they would have to be co-applicants to the Department of Planning in order to activate or seek to be reviewed under these conditions. The sign in question would have to have been existing and still existing today for the last 30 years. And then there would have to be, as I was saying, a specific submission that includes detailed information about the history of the sign, the importance of it to the community or the building or to the city itself, as well as a plan that details how it will be maintained, how it will be restored.

The restoration will have to be in effect to no less than the 30-year-old version of the sign that existed. So this is not requiring someone to restore a sign that was, say, 70 years old back to how it appeared 70 years ago. It simply has to refer back to at least the last 30 years of its existence.

Much like high-rise signs, vintage sign square footage will not count towards that which is allowed on a zoning lot. And this designation will have to be renewed every five years if an applicant is successful in getting it approved. This proposal does not forego any of the additional oversight that City Council may have.

So whether it's related to encroachment upon a public way, whether there is a sign height or a sign square footage that would otherwise trigger City Council review, those requirements all still stay in effect. There is no additional fee for this sign other than the review fee that comes through to our department. And then the normal or the current application fee as it relates to a sign itself off-premise and on.

So now in regards to the message, there are two aspects of a sign that can be maintained or possibly sought to be altered. So in the instance of an on-premise sign, this was Dinkles Bakery on the near northwest side. This business has since closed.

There was a recent story about someone seeking to redevelop this site and reestablish this sign on its facade. If they were successful in achieving that development and approval through City Council, they could reestablish this sign on the exterior of their proposed building. They could alter the letters to read for potentially a new name of the development if they chose.

But the requirements or the confines for that design would be limited to what you see on the screen. So it would be the black background, the green border, the yellow letters of that same stylization and the projection of the sign. So the sign type would need to remain the same.

If it was an illuminated sign, it could stay illuminated. If it was a painted wall sign, it must stay a painted wall sign. So there is an allowance to modify, but only within the confines of remaining as an on-premise sign as this one was.

Secondarily, we also have some signs which would be categorized as off-premise. So these would advertise for a product or a service that is not available on the property where the sign is located. In this instance, what are more commonly known as ghost signs, this 7-Up sign, for instance, could be restored and it could be repainted to mimic the colors and the stylization that was original.

Or it could be revised to reflect a new brand, an off-premise brand, for instance. Or it could be revised, again, under the same color scheme and layout and size to reflect an on-premise allowance. However, if this were converted to an on-premise sign, then it could not go back to an off-premise.

That concludes the ordinance. Chairman, I'm happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (31:46 - 32:01)
So, Mr. Murphy, if you would go back to slide 7. So that Dinkle sign, because it hangs over the public way, it would still have to go through the council approval process.

[Speaker 3] (32:02 - 32:02)
Yes, sir.

[Speaker 1] (32:02 - 32:17)
And then if you go to slide 8, so that sign, if that is 10 by 10, so over 100, let's say it's 11, so it's over 100 square feet, that would still have to go through the council approval process.

[Speaker 3] (32:17 - 32:28)
Or at any point more than 24 feet in height. So, for instance, if any element of that sign were to achieve that level, this or Dinkle's, it would have to come through a building permit through city council as well.

[Speaker 1] (32:29 - 33:01)
So I know during the briefings, some of my colleagues had questions on that. So I just want to make very clear that this does not alter any of the processes that require council approval and automatic sign-off. It will still have to come back to the aldermen, to the council.

It's just that this now allows these older signs the option to do that. Correct. Thank you.

And thank you to all my colleagues who attended the briefings and the hearings. Does anyone else have any questions? Vice Chair Lawson.

Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 18] (33:02 - 33:27)
I just wanted to say I really appreciate the clarity here. We have gone back and forth in 44 on what is and is not a commercial message, what is and is not art. So to have this clarity as opposed to defining art is really, really appreciated.

I did want to ask the 7UP sign. So you had mentioned, so they can, so 7UP can come in and do a totally different sign. Or someone else can come in.

What's sort of the parameters? Go through that again.

[Speaker 3] (33:27 - 34:38)
So whoever owns this building could apply. And if, I mean, presuming there was another building here or there was some other loss of ownership of the sign itself, for the sake of simplicity, we'll say the building owner is also the owner of the sign. They could apply to establish this as a vintage sign.

Their application would then include a restoration plan. The coloring, the, you know, presuming it's painted, they will have a simpler plan to provide, but they will provide one that restores it to a cleaner and more modern version of what you see. It's the same color pattern.

It's the same stylization of letters and symbols. It looks the same. Were someone instead to say, I no longer want it to say 7UP, I want it to say Chevrolet, presuming that there are no trademark or other legal infringements for changing out various designs, because some may be far more specific and copyrighted than this 7UP, they could alter the lettering from 7UP to say Chevrolet.

But it would have to be in the same stylization of the letters. It would have to be within the same confines of size. It may not always be feasible to alter an off-premise sign or even some on-premise signs to a new entity or to a new name.

[Speaker 18] (34:38 - 34:51)
I mean, I don't know, you know, 7UP, you don't see as much advertising as you did at one point. But there's value there. I mean, every sign has a value, especially one of this size and depending on what they're facing.

So I think people are going to get creative, which is good. You know, I think that's what we want.

[Speaker 27] (34:52 - 34:56)
That's all I have. Thank you, Chairman. Alderman Dowell.

[Speaker 20] (35:01 - 35:24)
Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think this question, Patrick, might be for Deanna.

I'm just trying to get a handle on this. So, you know, you and I have had that discussion about the building on Motoro that had the sign issue in the landmark district. Would that sign be allowed, the new sign?

Would that new sign be allowed with this ordinance?

[Speaker 23] (35:25 - 35:50)
Hello, Alderman. The landmarks ordinance would still govern all of the signage and changes to the buildings in the landmark district or individually designated landmarks. So this would be evaluated in conjunction with any permissions to retain the sign.

The sign that we were discussing, I believe, was a new sign. So this ordinance would not impact it.

[Speaker 20] (35:50 - 35:57)
Even though it had an old sign that was on the building that probably was met the 30 year.

[Speaker 23] (35:59 - 36:49)
It's it's still the landmarks ordinance that would govern us to the changes to the character of that sign. If the sign is not landmarked, because some signs may specifically have significance that are recognized in the designation ordinance. If that sign could be removed and there is a path through zoning to make changes, then yes, we would take it into account.

As far as that, but we would still review the attachment to the building to make sure it does not damage any of the historic masonry. We would still review the overall impact on the light on the overall size relative to the building and the district. But it would certainly help in the process going through that review.

[Speaker 20] (36:50 - 36:54)
Okay. I think I have it. Thank you very much.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (36:55 - 36:58)
Diana, if you could please state your name and title for the record.

[Speaker 23] (36:58 - 37:02)
Yes, sorry. Deanna Cavallo, Historic Preservation Division with DPD.

[Speaker 1] (37:03 - 37:05)
Thank you. Alderman Villegas.

[Speaker 30] (37:08 - 37:09)
We just want to be recognized for the call.

[Speaker 27] (37:10 - 37:11)
Welcome.

[Speaker 1] (37:12 - 38:03)
Any other questions from members of the committee? All right. So seeing no more questions, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

Alderman Cruz moves do pass. Are there any objections? Hearing none, the ordinance is passed.

Thank you so much. So moving on, we have one historical landmark designation, the designation of the Greater Tabernacle Cathedral located at 11300 South Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive in the Ninth Ward. We have Daniel Clay Burr of this Historic Preservation Division of the Department of Planning and Development here to present this matter.

Mr. Clay, is it Burr or Bure? It's Clybur, actually. Oh, Clybur.

[Speaker 5] (38:03 - 43:43)
That's fine. All right. Well, Mr. Clyburn, apologies. Please proceed. Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. Dan Clybur, Department of Planning and Development.

For your consideration today is a proposed ordinance for landmark designation of Greater Tabernacle Cathedral, former Holy Rosary Parish, located on the far south side of Chicago. At the onset, please note that this proposed designation was initiated directly by the members of Greater Tabernacle Cathedral, who made a suggestion for landmark designation through the Commission on Chicago Landmarks Program Committee in 2022. And the commission voted to approve the designation at its June, 2023 meeting.

In addition, Ninth Ward Alderman Beal is supportive of the designation as well. For orientation, Greater Tabernacle Cathedral is located at the southwest corner of South Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive and East 113th Street in the Roseland Community Area, just outside of Pullman in the Ninth Ward. The designation, as outlined in red, consists of the former Holy Rosary Church building located at 113-00 South King Drive, represented by the red star, and the former rectory building connected to it, represented by the blue star, located just to the west at 351 East 113th Street.

The Commission on Chicago Landmarks found that the building meets four criteria for designation, including the criterion for heritage. Tracing its origins to 1882, Holy Rosary Catholic Church was the first English-speaking Catholic parish in the Roseland-Pullman area. At the beginning, the establishment of the parish was difficult, as George Pullman, founder of the Pullman Car Works and Company Town just to the east, refused to sell any land for the construction of the parish, and instead sought to force all denominations into Greenstone Church in the middle of his company town.

However, after some wrangling, by 1890 the current church building was completed for the then largely Irish population in the area, and despite a devastating fire in 1937 and the subsequent economic and industrial challenges in the wider area over the course of its 133-year history, the building has fostered three congregations, including Holy Rosary, New Day Ministries International, and, since 2016, Greater Tabernacle Church. Throughout this time, it has remained a constant in the Roseland community as a place for worship and a center for community education and culture. The Commission also found that the designation met the criterion for person.

From 1985 to 1988, Barack Obama led the Developing Communities Project from the organization's headquarters in the rectory of Holy Rosary Church as the first executive director of the organization. The Developing Communities Project was a faith-based organization established in response to an increase in unemployment due to the closure of manufacturing plants in southeast Chicago. Under the leadership of Obama, the organization was incorporated as a nonprofit in 1986 and established programming to support the local community.

According to the Obama Foundation, the years former President Obama spent working as a community organizer on the South Side were the best education I ever had, he recalls. The Commission also found that the building meets criterion for architecture. The design for the former Holy Rosary Church by Solon S.

Beeman is monumental yet restrained. The Romanesque Revival edifice features limited architectural ornamentation, and instead the exterior is dominated by projecting cross-gable roof forms, monumental arched windows, the juxtaposition in color, texture, and materiality between the bright red brick exterior and heavily rough-hewn Joliet limestone base, and a commanding 85-foot-tall bell tower. Later alterations, such as the stained-glass windows pictured at the upper right, were installed at the front facade to replace those lost after the fire.

In addition, the Commission found it met criterion for architect. Solon S. Beeman is one of Chicago's most renowned late 19th century and early 20th century architects.

Beeman designed over 1,300 buildings in the company town of Pullman alone, including the Greenstone Church, Hotel Florence, Market Square, and many others. In terms of integrity, as the Greater Tabernacle Cathedral complex stands today, it clearly retains the historic architectural and aesthetic integrity as when the church was completed in 1890 and the rectory in circa 1897-1911 for the Holy Rosary Parish. Alterations and maintenance over time have been sympathetic and have preserved the integrity of the complex over the last 133 years.

In conclusion, again, the building is located in the 9th Ward, and Alderman Anthony Beal has provided a support letter for the project. With me today is Pastor Eric Booker of Greater Tabernacle Cathedral, who is supportive of the designation, and it should be noted that the church has been faithful stewards of the building since 2016. We recommend that the significant historical and architectural features of the building be identified as all exterior elevations, including roof lines of the church and attached rectory building.

You have a proposed ordinance to that effect. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (43:44 - 45:54)
Thank you so much. We do have the support of Alderman Beal on this item. Are there any questions by committee members?

Seeing none, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Hearing none, the designation is passed. Thank you so much.

Last up on the addendum is large signs over 100 square feet in area 24 feet above grade. We will hear them all together. I will read the ward followed by the addresses and take a motion at the end.

In the 2nd Ward, two signs located at 352 East Illinois Street. In the 14th Ward, 4100 West Anne Lurie. In the 23rd Ward, 6084 South Archer Avenue.

Two signs in the 27th Ward located at 400 West Division Street. One sign in the 27th Ward located at 1129 North Well Street. In the 41st Ward, one sign located at 11601 Toohey Avenue.

Lastly, in the 42nd Ward, one sign located at 612 North Well Street. Are there any questions by committee members? If none, do I hear do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

Alderwoman Clay moves do pass. Any objections? Hearing none, the orders are passed.

We will now move on to the regular agenda in an effort to ensure the committee meeting runs as smoothly as possible. The typical order in which items will be heard has been updated. Items will be grouped together according to witness and will be heard in that order rather than ward order as we have done in the past.

Got it. So the first three items, number A-8826, number A-8827, and number A-8828 will be held to the end of the meeting as we wait for the aldermen staff to come down and testify. So that brings us to number A-8834 in the 41st Ward, ordinance referred 52423, common address 8201 West Higgins Road.

And this is for a plan development 1136, community plan development to B3-1 Community Shopping District. And we have our zoning administrator, Patrick Murphy, who's going to speak to this item.

[Speaker 27] (46:06 - 46:07)
Hi, good morning.

[Speaker 3] (46:07 - 46:42)
Patrick Murphy with the Department of Planning. This is a current plan development for a former three hotel property on Higgins Road on the far northwest side of the city adjacent to the Kennedy Expressway. The project never materialized and through the natural courses of both the rules within the municipal code and the requirements of the plan development, it is to be sunset back to the immediately preceding district, which is what this action does today.

This is only the sunsetting of the PD. Any subsequent redevelopment would have to go through its own application and review, depending on those details.

[Speaker 1] (46:43 - 46:51)
And for the public and committee members, type one zoning map amendments are set to sunset after two years, if no, and then PDs are six years.

[Speaker 3] (46:52 - 47:05)
Type one's non-downtown sunset after two, correct. Plan development sunset after six with an option for a one-year extension. This has exceeded that extension.

It was being used temporarily by IDOT during their reconstruction of the Kennedy Expressway.

[Speaker 1] (47:06 - 48:07)
All right, so we do have a letter of support from the local aldermen. Are there any questions? If there are none, is there a motion do pass by the same roll call to establish quorum?

Alderman Ramirez moves do pass. Any objections? All right, the item passes.

So we are now moving on to page two of the agenda. This is number 22200-T1 in the first ward. Ordinance referred 621-23.

The common address is 1746 West Division Street, and this is for a B3-2 community shopping district to B3-3 community shopping district. We do have substitute narrative and plans, so Vice Chair Lawson moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Are there any objections?

If none, the substitute narrative and plans are accepted and now before us, and we have Attorney Liz Butler, who has some slides.

[Speaker 2] (48:23 - 52:19)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Liz Butler. I'm a partner with the law firm of Taft, Stettinius & Hollister, located at 111 East Wacker Drive in Chicago.

Along with my colleague Brayden Lord, we represent the applicant in this matter, Palazzo 1746 LLC. I'm joined today by Dario Mani, the owner of the subject property, and the operator and head chef of Tortello, the Italian restaurant and handmade pasta shop that's located at the property. As well as our design team is with us today to answer any questions about the proposed development.

The applicant is before the committee today requesting a rezoning of the subject property from the B3-2 community shopping district to the B3-3 community shopping district. In order to allow the addition of floor area for construction of a first and second floor rear building addition to the existing three-story mixed use building at the property. The property is an approximately 100 foot by 24 foot lot and is improved with an existing over 100 year old three-story building that is believed to be constructed in the 1890s.

The building, as you can see from the diagram, occupies substantially all of the lot. The first floor contains restaurant space and the second and third floors each contain a residential dwelling unit. Tortello opened in 2019 and against all odds survived the pandemic and is thriving.

The restaurant and the pasta shop are doing so well that the business owners would like to modernize their facility to accommodate the growth of their business. And to do so the owner is proposing to reconfigure the building to create additional storage space and a more efficient kitchen and production space. Specifically, the owner is proposing to expand its ground floor storage areas and kitchen and dining areas to the second floor of the existing building.

Doing so requires partial demolition and reconstruction of a rear portion of the building to capture additional floor area on the ground floor. An existing apartment on the second floor would be replaced with a dining room for the restaurant, additional kitchen and storage space, and a second floor addition that follows the footprint of the ground floor building envelope. The third floor and the residential unit located there remain unchanged.

The proposed scope of work increases the building floor area from 4210 square feet, or an FAR of 1.75 to 5710 square feet with a new FAR of 2.4, which is not out of scale with the character of the surrounding area, however, exceeds the maximum FAR that's permitted in the existing zoning district. Therefore a change to the dash three is necessary to allow this addition. We've worked closely with Alderman LaSpada and his staff on review of the proposed expansion and modernization, including presenting the project at a First Ward First Look virtual community meeting which was noticed by flyering throughout the surrounding neighborhood.

The applicant also shared the project details with its immediate neighbors and the West Town Chamber of Commerce who support the expansion plans. On behalf of Tortello. We think Alderman LaSpada for his support of this matter, which will allow an existing locally owned Chicago business to invest in and modernize and over 100 year old building, and to remain in and expand its business in the first word.

We understand that Alderman LaSpada submitted a letter of support to the committee in advance of today's meeting, and I'm not sure if he's in attendance. I know he's so he may want to make his own remarks. We think the committee for its consideration of this matter and respectfully request your favorable recommendation of the request.

Our team is available to answer any questions that the committee may have and I apologize I did not introduce John Dufresne with space architects, when I sat down. That concludes our presentation. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (52:19 - 52:25)
Thank you so much and we do have Alderman LaSpada here so we'll recognize you for the quorum and also do you have anything you'd like to share.

[Speaker 7] (52:26 - 53:05)
Thank you so much Alderman LaSpada sneaking in the back tardy for the purposes of quorum my apologies chair, but number one love what the restaurant does. My wife knows it's a special treat for me when I buy tortellos pasta for the house, but expanding all of these spaces that we're talking about expanding what you do on division is outstanding and on top of that. I appreciate their participation in our transparent first ward zoning process from hearing from the community for taking in feedback and I'm really proud of this project and I hope for the favorable consideration from my colleagues.

[Speaker 1] (53:05 - 54:11)
Thank you. Thank you so much. Any other questions or comments from members.

All right. If there are none do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum with the substitute narrative and plans. Alderman LaSpada moves do pass with the substitute narrative and plans, any objections.

Hearing none, the item is passed. Congratulations. Thank you all so much.

All right, we are moving right along sticking with attorney Liz Butler so next is number 22213 dash t one in the 28th Ward ordinance referred 621 23. This is 1434 to 1446 West Fillmore Street, and this is an RT for residential two flat townhouse and multi unit district and arm five residential multi unit district to be to dash three neighborhood mixed use district. We also have substitute narrative and plans.

So Chairman Lawson moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type one application by the same call roll call that was used to determine quorum, are there any objections. Hearing none, the substitute narrative and plans are before us, and we'll turn it over to the attorney.

[Speaker 2] (54:11 - 58:34)
Thank you, Mr Chairman and members of the committee again my name is Liz Butler with the law firm of Taft Stettinius and Hollister located at 111 East Walker Drive in Chicago. And again with my colleague Braden Lord we represent the applicant in this matter 1434 West Fillmore LLC. We're joined today by Alec Greenberg and JP Bartley on behalf of the applicant.

Applicant is requesting a rezoning of the subject property, located at 1434 West Fillmore Street from the RT for residential two flat townhouse and multi unit district, and the B three to community shopping district to the B two three neighborhood mixed use district in order to allow the construction of a five story multi unit residential building, measuring approximately 56 feet in height, containing 50 dwelling units, 25 parking spaces, 50 bicycle parking spaces and one interior loading space. The site contains approximately 15,975 square feet of site area.

It's currently improved with a circuit surface parking lot. The site is bounded by 12 foot wide alley on the north, several three story multi unit residential buildings to the east, West Fillmore Street to the south and a two story residential building to the west. The block is characterized by a mix of zoning and multi unit residential uses with the predominantly commercial and mixed use Taylor Street corridor to the north.

The change request to the B two dash three district is necessary to allow the five story residential building with 50 units, and to receive the enhancements that are available as a result of the connected communities ordinance for new construction and transit surf locations, specifically, reduced MLA standard and increased FDR for projects that provide affordable units on site. The subject property is a transit surf location, due to its proximity to the Roosevelt Road bus line corridor and the Polk Street CTA station. The project.

Actually I want to briefly address some remarks that were made during the public comment period with respect to traffic safety. This project will eliminate to existing curb cuts. This is a trend, but subject to all of the criteria for new construction and transit surf locations, including compliance with the design standards for pedestrian streets.

The project will meet all of those design standards will eliminate those existing curb cuts, and will direct all of the vehicular traffic exclusively through the alley, as required and contemplated by the connected communities ordinance. The development team engaged in extensive outreach to surrounding neighbors including hosting several in person small group meetings in the neighborhood, actually walking the block, knocking on doors to share the details of the proposed development. Number of letters of support were provided by neighboring property owners.

The applicant also worked very closely with alderman Irvin on the program for the development and, and the design and made enhancements to the design of the project in coordination with alderman, and in response to community input. We understand that the alderman is in support of the project, and we provided that letter of support to the committee in advance of this hearing. Additionally alderman Irvin's office mailed notice to surrounding property owners and hosted a virtual community meeting for the project in May, approximately 45 neighbors attended the meeting and provided strongly favorable feedback, including the Commissioner of Housing Commissioner Navarro attended the meeting in her capacity as a neighbor of the project and expressed her strong support for this project which meets the requirements of the connected communities ordinance. We think the community for I mean we think the committee for its consideration of this matter. We respectfully request your favorable recommendation of this change request that concludes our presentation but our team is available to answer any questions that the committee might have.

I know that this is in close proximity to the 34th board and alderman Conway was curious about the design, I think we have one rendering that we can show. And we can speak to the design intent if there are questions on that. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (58:35 - 58:39)
So, arm raised from alderman Conway and then alderman was bottom.

[Speaker 25] (58:40 - 58:55)
Yeah, let's thank you for the presentation. Now, so you said the existing. It's a surface parking lot and then there's also a building on it as well.

Is that right, only parking. It's all it's the whole thing is a surface parking lot.

[Speaker 2] (58:55 - 59:12)
And how, what is the height of this 56 feet is the is the zoning height, the, the top floor is set back to minimize the bulk and appearance of height of the building.

[Speaker 25] (59:12 - 59:24)
And, and, just in case I'm sorry 20 you say 25 parking places, which is 25 parking spaces. Okay. That sounds great.

I have no further questions, Mr Chairman. I'll do them in the spotter.

[Speaker 7] (59:25 - 59:39)
Thank you, Chairman. I am just curious because it is, it's rather difficult to tell from the renderings. Did you choose to do ground floor commercial and if so why or why not the ground floor will be all residential.

[Speaker 2] (59:40 - 59:52)
Okay, that this is a residential block so we went to the B two three to allow ground floor residential. We didn't think that commercial would fit with the character of the block.

[Speaker 7] (59:52 - 59:54)
Okay, appreciate your sharing.

[Speaker 1] (59:54 - 59:56)
Thank you, sir. Thank you so much.

[Speaker 28] (59:56 - 1:00:08)
Any more questions alderman Cruz, man, just a quick question I know you brought up the portable housing with this we fulfill with the arrow, which.

[Speaker 2] (1:00:08 - 1:00:28)
This is subject to the arrow and the proposal is to meet the affordable requirements ordinance compliance strategy, I'm sorry to meet the requirements by providing 20% of units as affordable to households that are earning 60% of the area median income.

[Speaker 28] (1:00:28 - 1:00:34)
And what are the. Are these like two bedrooms like what is the.

[Speaker 2] (1:00:35 - 1:00:49)
Yeah, it's a mix of one, twos and three bedrooms so of the 50 units, 14 are proposed to be three bedrooms, 24 are proposed to be two bedrooms and 12 are proposed to be either one bedrooms or studios.

[Speaker 28] (1:00:56 - 1:00:58)
There's a follow up question with the arrow.

[Speaker 20] (1:00:59 - 1:01:07)
Yes, thank you. How are you splitting up the mix of your arrow units. How many three bedrooms, two bedrooms.

[Speaker 2] (1:01:08 - 1:01:12)
They will be provided proportionately with the unit mix.

[Speaker 27] (1:01:12 - 1:01:54)
So, so what's that number. I have it, I have it in my notes. One moment.

Thank you for your patience.

[Speaker 2] (1:01:54 - 1:02:18)
At one point we were proposing to provide eight affordable units on site, in which case, there would be two one bedrooms for two bedrooms and two three bedrooms. We're considering increasing the number of affordable to have all 20% on site. So I don't have the breakdown in front of me but I can get that for you and provide it through staff.

[Speaker 1] (1:02:21 - 1:02:25)
Thank you. Yes, please get us that information. Other women crews.

[Speaker 28] (1:02:25 - 1:02:45)
I know you said you hosted many community meetings and there was, you know, a lot of support from the community in favor but just want to speak with there was a gentleman here with some concerns. What were some of the concerns you were hearing from the community and how you do all adjusted to fulfill some of their needs or requirements. Sure.

[Speaker 2] (1:02:46 - 1:04:09)
So, I actually spoke with Mr Rosenbaum several times before this meeting. He actually never expressed the that he would be objecting to the matter so we're not. We have not had conversations with him about his objections.

There were questions about the height, and the number of units that are proposed. Ultimately, those kind of concerns were addressed by the setback of the upper floor, as well as kind of a discussion of what the connected communities ordinance now allows in terms of density, and what it intends to promote in terms of putting more multi unit residential development in close proximity to transit so that was a big part of the discussion changes were made to the design of the building to break up the massing and Alec can talk about that a little bit about the design intent.

We also set the building back to match the setback on the block to provide a softer edge and more landscaping at the grade. A big topic of discussion was whether, whether there would be more dog parks in the neighborhood, which we don't have a dog park but I hope that there will be more dog parks in the future. Thank you.

[Speaker 28] (1:04:09 - 1:04:10)
Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:10 - 1:04:18)
Thank you. Any other questions from committee members. All right, if all the women clay and then we'll go back to all the women down.

[Speaker 32] (1:04:19 - 1:04:26)
Just wanted to confirm Liz that all 20 of the 20% ar roles are going to be on site or are you looking at other options.

[Speaker 27] (1:04:29 - 1:04:31)
All 20% will be on site.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:36 - 1:04:38)
Thank you additional questions are all the women down.

[Speaker 20] (1:04:38 - 1:04:55)
Yes, one question, can you go back to the zoning map that you had up there. Okay, so I, the properties to the right that you call out as B two three, you're showing us that there also be two threes on that block.

[Speaker 27] (1:04:56 - 1:05:43)
What about what you're not showing. Those are existing buildings there. We have a screenshot of the zoning map that these.

What's the zoning. He told me, he told me. All right.

All right. Thank you, Mr. Chair.

[Speaker 1] (1:05:44 - 1:06:25)
Thank you. All right. Any more questions from members.

Okay so hearing none. Do I hear a motion do pass for the substitute narrative and plans by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum alderman Conway moves do pass with the substitute narrative and plans any objections. Hearing none, the item is passed.

Thank you so much. All right, moving on to number 22207 in the 36th Ward ordinance referred 621 23. This is a 2450 West Chicago Avenue.

And this is a B one dash two neighborhood shopping district to be to dash three neighborhood mixed use district. And again we have attorney Liz Butler with slides.

[Speaker 2] (1:06:26 - 1:06:29)
I'm going to ask my colleague Braden to.

[Speaker 1] (1:06:32 - 1:06:36)
Sure, if you could please state your name and affiliation title for the record.

[Speaker 10] (1:06:37 - 1:09:24)
Yes. Good morning. My name is Braden Lord and I am an attorney with tasks that genius and Hollister LLP at 111 East Wacker Drive in Chicago.

It looks like this is working. And I'm, of course, joined by my colleague, Liz Butler, together we represent the applicant in this matter 2450 W Chicago LLC and gray boughs mink LLC. I'm joined today by Alec Greenberg, on behalf of the applicant.

The applicant is requesting a rezoning of the subject property located at 2450 West Chicago Avenue from the B one to neighborhood shopping district to the B two three neighborhood mixed use district in order to allow the conversion of the ground floor commercial space in the existing building at the property to a ground floor dwelling unit. The subject property contains approximately 2916 square feet of site area and is improved with a three story mixed use building with ground floor commercial space and five dwelling units, as it exists. The subject property is located on the block generally bound by a 16 foot wide public alley to the north west Chicago Northwestern Avenue to the east, West Chicago Avenue to the south and North Campbell Avenue to the west, that block includes a number of buildings that similarly would have ground floor residential uses.

During and following the pandemic, the ground floor commercial space at the existing building has generally remained vacant and ownership has had a tough time finding tenants to occupy the space. So in order to reactivate that space and put it to productive use the applicant proposes to convert the ground floor for an additional dwelling unit. The change request to the B two three district is necessary to allow the addition of a single ground floor dwelling unit to the existing building with the additional ground floor unit, the building will contain six dwelling units and to automobile parking spaces, no modifications to the building envelope, and no new structures or improvements are proposed.

The applicant has discussed the proposal with alderman Vegas and his staff, and it's our understanding that the alderman is in support of the request, we know that alderman Vegas is with us today in case he would like to make any remarks, a letter of support was provided by his office to the committee in advance of this hearing. We thank the committee for its consideration of this matter and respectfully request your favorable recommendation, and we're available to answer any and all questions that the committee may have. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:09:24 - 1:10:22)
Thank you so much. Any questions. All right, if there are none.

Hearing none. Do I hear emotion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum alderman Vegas moves do pass any objections. Hearing none, the item is passed.

Thank you all so much. Second with Miss Butler we have number 22214 dash t one in the 44th Ward ordinance referred 621 23. We have substitute narrative and plans so alderman Lawson moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections, hearing none, the substitute narrative and plans are accepted. And this is at 3262 dash 64 North Clark Street. This is a B three dash three community shopping district to be to dash three neighborhood mixed use district.

Take it away.

[Speaker 2] (1:10:23 - 1:13:30)
Thank you, Mr Chair and members of the committee again for the record my name is Liz Butler. I'm an attorney with the law firm of tasks to tap stitching is in Hollister located at 111 East record drive I'm sure you all have memorized or address by now. Along with my colleague Braden Lord we represent the applicant in this matter lion Clark LLC.

I'm joined, we are joined today by Brad gold on behalf of the applicant. The applicant is requesting a rezoning of the subject property located at 3262 to 64 North Clark Street from the B three three community shopping district to the B two three neighborhood mixed use district in order to allow the construction of a four story residential building with seven residential dwelling units, which includes a single accessible residential dwelling unit on the ground floor, approximately 956 square feet of ground floor commercial space to vehicular parking spaces and seven bicycle parking spaces.

The subject property contains approximately 3750 square feet of site area, and is currently improved with a three story mixed use residential building. When the applicant acquired the property last year, zoning certificate and the zoning map noted that the property was zoned as part of the B two three district. The applicant specifically acquired the site, because of its B two three zoning which would allow the proposed development and the ground floor residential use.

After filing an application for building permits for the proposed development, it came to the applicants attention that there was an error on the zoning map, and the zoning certificate. The change request will establish the B two three district which is needed for the proposed development again specifically to allow the ground floor accessible dwelling unit. A transit serve location parking reduction will also be requested.

It's not being requested as part of this application. Prior to the connected communities ordinance this type one zoning change would have authorized the parking reduction however will need to file a subsequent application for that request through an administrative adjustment. We just put in a pitch, we'd love to see the committee consider some common sense tweaks to the zoning ordinance to reinstate these parking reductions back into the type one process to kind of streamline and avoid the several months delay that will result from having to file a subsequent application.

We can discuss the proposal with Alderman Lawson and his staff. We forwarded a letter of support from Alderman Lawson to the committee in advance of this hearing and because the alderman is in attendance today he may want to make his own remarks. We think the committee for its consideration of this matter and we respectfully request your favorable recommendation.

We're available to answer any questions that you might have. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:13:30 - 1:13:32)
Alderman La Spada.

[Speaker 7] (1:13:32 - 1:13:55)
Thank you so much, Chair. This may actually be a zoning administrator Murphy question, and hopefully broadly educational because usually our zoning goes more permissive, as it goes up but I do I take it right that B3 would have prohibited ground floor residential which is why we're going to the BT. No he's shaking his head.

[Speaker 3] (1:13:58 - 1:14:25)
Patrick Murphy with Department of Planning. No, it does not prevent ground floor residential it requires that if an individual is seeking to do non commercial uses below the second floor that they have to seek approval from the Zoning Board of Appeals, and it's based on the character and context of the street itself as to whether it's appropriate along with other reviews by this from a special use standpoint, so it is not prohibited. And it is not erroneously labeled on the zoning map either.

[Speaker 7] (1:14:26 - 1:14:33)
Helpful context also lends clarity to why we're doing the zoning change here today. Thank you, sir.

[Speaker 1] (1:14:33 - 1:14:36)
Thank you so much, Alderman Lawson.

[Speaker 18] (1:14:36 - 1:15:48)
Thank you, Mr Chairman, I want to thank this developer and Liz and team. This is the third building of this type they have done in my ward. There's actually one that's completed on Halstead one that's under construction that is about 300 feet away from my house.

And then this, and this is three new accessible units in a community that is well served by transit that is very easy to walk and roll around for anything you need and so I just want to point out I don't know if you want to go to the first floor. If that's possible. But by putting the accessible unit in the rear.

They're able to get everything at grade and still keep a full storefront in the front. We all know that I, I have too much commercial space in my ward I'm probably not alone. So, by including the housing to help support our small businesses to the max were able to, you know, help help our entire street so I just wanted to point that out.

You know, I think we're doing a lot of B2 just like the previous project some are not as easy as others, but as we look at our commercial corridors and are smart about our commercial spaces, you know, to avoid the ZBA to come into a zoning change for a type one is something that I think our community appreciate so thank you for your work on this and thank you, Mr Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:15:50 - 1:17:15)
Any other questions. All right, hearing none. Do I hear emotion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum and of course this is to pass the substitute narrative and plans that were accepted alderman Lawson moves do pass with the substitute narrative and plans.

Are there any objections. Hearing none, the item is passed. Okay, so the next two items on page three we're going to defer them for the request of the older person so that's number 22218 in the 25th Ward 1828 South Racine Avenue and number 22219 dash t one also in the 25th Ward at 1030 West 21st Street.

If there are no questions by committee members, Vice Chair Lawson makes a motion to defer the previously read items by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum objections. Hearing none, those two items are deferred. So we are now on page four.

And this is attorney human Castro. This is number 2221 dash t one in the 25th Ward 2156 West 21st Street, and this is a B three dash two community shopping district to be to dash five neighborhood mixed use district. Miss Castro please take it away.

[Speaker 19] (1:17:16 - 1:18:08)
Thank you, Chairman, and members of the board.

There will be one parking space and 11 bicycle spaces, and the applicant seeks parking reduction under the transit serve location guidelines of the Chicago zoning ordinance, and we also have automatic support as we worked with the alderman's office, and his zoning advisory board, and we seek favorable approval of the matter before you today.

[Speaker 1] (1:18:09 - 1:18:46)
All right. Are there any questions. Seeing none.

Do I hear a motion to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Alderwoman Fuentes moves to pass any objections. Hearing none, the item is passed.

We are now moving on to number 22222 dash t one in the 25th Ward ordinance referred 621 23 this is at 2158 West 18th Street, and this is an RT for residential to flat townhouse and multi unit district to be to dash five neighborhood makes use district Esquire Castro.

[Speaker 19] (1:18:47 - 1:19:33)
Thank you Chairman, again for the record my name is human Castro I'm a zoning attorney and it costs to ask her here before here before you for the matter located at 2158 West 18th Street. The property is also improved with the four story building that includes 10 building units in a three car garage.

The applicant seeks to rezone the property to add one dwelling unit for a total of 11 units, and the applicant also seeks parking reduction under the transit serve locations of the Chicago zoning ordinance. We have aldermanic support as well as we worked with the alderman and his zoning advisory board, and we seek favorable approval of this matter before you today.

[Speaker 27] (1:19:33 - 1:19:33)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:19:37 - 1:19:54)

Hearing none the substitute narrative and plans are accepted and vice chair Lawson moves to accept the substitute ordinance by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Are there any objections. Hearing none, the substitute ordinance and the substitute narrative and plans are before us, and Mr Scott.

[Speaker 21] (1:21:05 - 1:22:33)
Thank you very much, Mr Chairman members of the committee. For the record, my name is Andrew Scott with the law office of Dicom a gossip. As you mentioned, Mr chair the proposal before you is to rezone the subject property, which is about 136 feet wide by hundred and one foot deep lot at the northwest corner of West Eastwood and Northwestern Avenue.

Currently the property is a combination of B three two and B three three and we're seeking to rezone the property to a B three five. The property is very very well situated right across the street from the western brown line. In addition, it is right off of the Northwestern Avenue bus so again when this is when the city is considering transit serve locations, really an ideal location.

The proposal is for a six story 74 dwelling unit building 3900 square feet of retail and 10 parking spaces. We've had extensive community engagement on this project. We've actually had a total of eight meetings with different community groups including the Lincoln Square Chamber of Commerce heart of Lincoln Square greater Rockwell organization and the alderman zoning advisory committee throughout the process made a number of modifications to the building to garner the support of the neighborhood.

And we're here today to ask for your favorable support, I believe you should have a letter of support from alderman Martin on file, and I'm available to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (1:22:34 - 1:23:27)
Thank you. We do have a letter of support from alderman Martin. Are there any questions for Mr Scott.

Okay, hearing none. Do I hear a motion do pass for the substitute narrative and plans, and the substitute ordinance by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum alderman La Spada moves do pass any objections. Hearing none, the substitute ordinance narrative and plans are past.

Thank you very much. Thank you. Okay, we are now moving on to page five number 22198 in the 15th Ward.

This is 4359 South Wood Street. This is an RS three residential single unit detached house district to M one dash one limited manufacturing district, and we have witnessed Kareem Musa we're here to testify.

[Speaker 11] (1:23:27 - 1:25:48)

The property is located on 4359 South Wood Street in the 15th Ward. The property is currently sold on RS three residential single unit detached house district and the change request is for an M one dash one limited manufacturing business park district. The property is improved with an existing vacant 17,220 square foot one story brick and Mansory commercial building with three overhead doors with driveways onto what street and three off street parking spaces located inside the property on a 17,664 square foot lot.

Applicant proposes to establish a wholesale laundry detergent distribution facility and existing commercial building the change request to an M one dash one limited manufacturing business business park district would allow the proposed deals. We are currently renting a smaller commercial space nearby and we look forward to moving into our property which will be our primary business location. Applicant proposes to make interior alterations in order to prepare the premises for the proposed business operations.

We have the support of Alderman Lopez for this application and we request the committee's approval for this request to amend the Sony from RS three residential single unit detached house district to that of M one dash one limited manufacturing business park district. Our land use consultant Mr. Kareem Massivar is here with us to assist in providing any answers. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee I want to thank your staff and the Bureau of Sony for their assistance in helping us bring this matter before you today we stand prepared to answer any questions the committee may have. Should there be no further questions we humbly request your approval of this map amendment application.

[Speaker 1] (1:25:48 - 1:25:56)
All right, thank you so much, Mrs. King Donna, are there any questions, other woman dowel.

[Speaker 20] (1:25:57 - 1:26:01)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This building, do you have a picture of it.

[Speaker 11] (1:26:02 - 1:26:03)
We do not have a picture.

[Speaker 20] (1:26:04 - 1:26:10)
Okay, and is this currently a laundry detergent distribution facility.

[Speaker 11] (1:26:11 - 1:26:12)
Currently it's vacant.

[Speaker 20] (1:26:12 - 1:26:14)
Currently it's.

[Speaker 11] (1:26:14 - 1:26:14)
Yes.

[Speaker 20] (1:26:14 - 1:26:20)
And what has the use of that building been in the past, because this whole block is just residential.

[Speaker 11] (1:26:21 - 1:26:30)
It's been like a garage kept as a garage, maintaining trucks, truck maintenance.

[Speaker 27] (1:26:35 - 1:26:36)
Okay. All right.

[Speaker 20] (1:26:38 - 1:26:52)
Okay, I had some concerns about this look like spot zoning in the middle of a residential area. But now that I look at the building, it's been there for eons. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:26:53 - 1:27:47)
Thank you so much and the building is a one story commercial building with a garage entrance. So, any other questions. We have heard from alderman Lopez who is in support.

If there are no more questions, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum alderman Lawson moves do pass any objections. Hearing none, the item is passed. All right, moving right along.

Thank you all so much. Got it. So we are at number 22211 in the 26th ward.

This is at 4111 West Armitage Avenue, and this is a B3 dash one community shopping district to be three dash to community shopping district and we have attorney, Nicholas fatigue us to present.

[Speaker 4] (1:27:48 - 1:28:46)
Thank you, Chairman for the record again Nick fatigue us, I am here on behalf of the applicant and property owner. Miss Carmen Nazario. As you well know she is a, the executive director of and last tablets performing arts, which is a non for profit community arts organization.

It's actually been in the property since 2006. They're looking to do an expansion of their retail unit the retail space, and in order to account for the additional floor area, they're seeking a zoning change from a B3 dash one to a B3 dash two. I'd also point out for the record that I think there was an error in the publication.

This is not a type one zoning change so I wanted to make sure that that was reflected on the record. We, as I understand it have letters of support previously from your office, and also from Alderman Fuentes his office which we received last night. With that, I'd be happy to answer any questions you have about the project.

[Speaker 1] (1:28:46 - 1:28:49)
Thank you so much, older woman when this.

[Speaker 29] (1:28:49 - 1:29:31)
I will say that last hour last has been an organization in our community for decades, providing performing arts activities and programming for young people. It has been a space that has kept young people out of trouble. This particular zoning changes seeking to expand the commercial space so that more comprehensive programming can take place, and the space can also be divided to do two different types of activities at once.

Now Sadio has been, you know, a mover and shaker in our ward, and we also have a community process in place. The presentation was made to my community advisory council. It was approved favorably by all of our stakeholders.

And so I asked for the favorable approval of the zoning change.

[Speaker 1] (1:29:31 - 1:30:27)
Thank you so much, older woman, when it is and I would be remiss if I didn't know that unless that last also received a grant from the city of Chicago to assist with this build out. And we're all just so happy to see this wonderful or most of based nonprofit continue to grow. So are there any other questions or comments from members.

All right, hearing none older woman Fuentes moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Are there any objections. All right, the item is passed.

Thank you so much. We're moving on, and we're sticking with attorney Nicholas fatigue because this is number 22215 dash t one in the 27th Ward ordinance referred 621 23 at 115 South Francisco Avenue. This is an RT for residential two flat townhouse and multi unit district to see one dash three commercial neighborhood district.

All right.

[Speaker 4] (1:30:28 - 1:31:29)
Mr. Patinkas, thank you again Nick fatigue is for the record I'm here on behalf of the applicant and property owner the black light light fellowship, and also on behalf of Pastor Dr. Walter McCray the sole proprietor of the black light fellowship. The applicant is proposing to develop a currently vacant piece of property with a three story mixed use building. The proposed ground floor retail space will be occupied by administrative offices for a black light light fellowship publishing company a book publishing company there's actually no publication or binding on site.

But it is an administrative office and storage area for that. The owner. Above that though there will be eight residential units, the property is a transit serve location so the project is relying on a transit oriented development parking reduction.

We have met with Alderman Burnett, and I believe Alderman Burnett had voices support previously, and I'd be happy to answer any questions you or the committee members have about the project.

[Speaker 1] (1:31:30 - 1:32:07)
We have heard from Alderman Burnett and he is in support. Are there any questions from committee members. All right, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum Alderman Villegas moves do pass.

Are there any objections. Hearing none, the item is passed. We are moving on to page six, number 2220 dash t one in the 27th Ward.

This is 2500 to 2506 West Washington Boulevard, and this is an M one dash one limited manufacturing district to be to dash one neighborhood mixed use district. Mr fatigues.

[Speaker 4] (1:32:07 - 1:32:43)
Thank you again Chairman I'm here on behalf of the applicant and property owner ways as a royal. The applicant is proposing to convert an existing one and a half story warehouse building to a single family home. In order to do that.

This is a mandatory type one zoning change because we're seeking a change from a manufacturing district to the proposed be to dash one district. I would point out for the record share that we did catch a clerical error in the narrative so I am asking that a substitute narrative be accepted. There were no plan changes just the narrative and I did discuss that with Anna previously.

[Speaker 1] (1:32:43 - 1:33:01)
All right, so we have substitute narrative and plans vice chair Lawson moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum, are there any objections. Hearing none, the substitute narrative and plans are accepted.

[Speaker 4] (1:33:01 - 1:33:07)
The applicant participated in a community meeting with Alderman Burnett and again I believe Alderman Burnett his voice to support for the project.

[Speaker 1] (1:33:07 - 1:33:50)
All right. He has Alderman Burnett has informed us of his support. Are there any questions by committee members.

If not, do I hear a motion do pass by this for the substitute narrative and plans for the type one by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Alderman Knudson moves to pass. Are there any objections.

Hearing none, the item is passed with the substitute narrative and plans. Going on to the second item on page six number two to 210 in the 28th Ward this is 1113 South Mozart Street, this is an RT for residential to flat townhouse and multi unit district to arm fine residential multi unit district Mr fatigas.

[Speaker 4] (1:33:50 - 1:34:37)
Thank you again Chairman, I'm here on behalf of the applicants and property owners, Patrick McLaughlin and Caitlin Beckham, the owners, I'm sorry the existing property is improved with a multi unit residential building there was a discrepancy as to whether or not all five of the existing units are were legally established. The consensus was that the permit history supported for legal units, the proposed zoning change to the RM five districts would permit the legal establishment of that fifth unit. The building is more than 50 years old, and there's no new parking requirement but it will continue to be supported by three offsite parking spaces.

We did meet with Alderman Jason urban on this and he has provided a letter of support for the zoning change. Thank you so much.

[Speaker 1] (1:34:38 - 1:35:04)
Any questions. All right. All the women down moves do pass any objections.

Hearing none, the item is passed. We're now on number 22209 in the 29th Ward, this is 2229 North Harlem Avenue. And this is an RS three residential single unit detached house district to RT for residential to flat townhouse and multi unit district Mr fatigas.

[Speaker 4] (1:35:04 - 1:35:55)
Thank you again, I'm here on behalf of the applicant and property owner some diversity LLC Harlem series. The applicant in this case is seeking a zoning change to permit again an existing fourth residential unit in a legal three flat. The building is more than 70 years old we were actually able to find a water record that reference the fourth unit, but again the permit history was inconsistent so the zoning change allows us to preserve the existing unit count within the building.

We did work with Alderman tell a Fiero he has provided a letter of support. And one other point for the record. This is a property that is landlocked, I believe, when we initially filed it we had referenced, no change to parking but there is no parking so I wanted it's not a type one, but I just wanted the committee to be aware that this is a landlocked property.

There is no parking the addition of one unit does not create any new parking requirement for the building.

[Speaker 1] (1:35:56 - 1:36:25)
Thank you questions. All right, hearing none older woman dowel moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine forum. Any objections.

Hearing none, the item is passed. Moving on to page seven number 2208 in the 32nd or 3025 North South Port, and 1349 to 59 West Nelson street this is a B3 dash two community shopping district to RT for residential to flat townhouse and multi unit district, Mr fatigas.

[Speaker 4] (1:36:25 - 1:37:19)
Thank you again I'm here on behalf of the applicant and property owner, Aaron Strauss, the subject property is a 3000 square foot lot that's improved with a four story three unit principal building. I'm sorry, reverse those a three story principal building containing four units and a detached two story coach house building. The permit history for the second floor coach house unit was inconsistent, and we're seeking a zoning change in order to use the additional dwelling unit ordinance to establish or reestablish the coach house unit on the second floor the detached garage.

No other changes are proposed to the principal building or the property generally except for again, the interior build out of that existing space. We worked with Alderman Wagespec's office as well as the South Lakeview neighbors, and I believe a letter of no objection was submitted prior to today's hearing, I'd be happy to answer any questions you or the committee members have.

[Speaker 1] (1:37:20 - 1:37:53)
We have heard from Alderman Wagespec who's in support. Are there any questions. All right, hearing none, Alderwoman Dowell moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections. Hearing none, the item is passed. We are now at number to to to 17 dash t one in the 39th Ward.

This is 3348 to 3358 West Foster Avenue, and this is a B one dash two neighborhood shopping district to be three dash three community shopping district. Again, Chairman.

[Speaker 4] (1:37:54 - 1:38:50)
The I'm here on behalf of the co applicants foster investment LLC and TriStar Realty Group LLC. The owners are proposing to redevelop the subject property with the new multi unit mixed use building. The proposed building will have retail space a grade and 47 residential units above the subject property is a transit serve location based on its proximity to the CTA station at Kimball.

We are proposing to reduce the parking to 22 total spaces to support the 47 residential unit total. We've gone through almost nine months of review with the alderman's office as well as the Hollywood North Park Community Association. And based on the iteration.

This is a type one change based on the final iteration that was filed we have the alderman support to proceed a letter should already be on file, and I'd be happy to answer any questions you or the committee members have about this project.

[Speaker 1] (1:38:51 - 1:39:46)
We have heard from older woman who didn't she isn't support. Are there any questions. All right, if there are none older woman down moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections. Hearing none, the item is passed. Thank you, sir.

All right, we are now moving on to attorney Sarah Barnes. Number 22224 dash t one in the 27th Ward. This is at 1218 West Adams Street and this is an M one dash three limited manufacturing business park district to a dx dash three downtown mixed use district.

We do have substitute narrative and plans. So vice chair Lawson moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum, are there objections hearing none. The substitute narrative and plans are before us and Esquire Barnes has a slide presentation for us.

[Speaker 6] (1:39:46 - 1:40:00)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, esteemed members of the committee. I'm happy to be here this afternoon, on behalf of the applicant, Kensington West loop building LLC.

[Speaker 1] (1:40:01 - 1:40:02)
Say your name for the record.

[Speaker 6] (1:40:02 - 1:43:15)
Oh, excuse me. And for the record, my name is Sarah Barnes I'm an attorney with the losses of Sam bank, located at 221 Northwest Dale Street. I'm Kensington West loop building LLC who is the applicant operates as Kensington school it is a locally family established school that has been operating in a daycare centers throughout Illinois, for the last 50 years, Kensington found a new space in the West loop at 1218 West Adams Street, which, if you go to the last slide Nicole.

Yep. Oh, sorry that one. It is part of what we would like to create as an educational campus right in the center of the West loop as you can see centers.

Skinner school is that the type, and Skinner Park, and then there's an international cultural Montessori school at the lower bottom half, we would be infilling the subject property with a new daycare facility so that residents of the West loop and families of the West loop can have an entire integrated campus to start their children and grow their children from ages, six weeks, all the way through high school. So with that the proposal calls for the construction of a new three story school building Thank you to replace the existing building that has been occupied by the Boy Scouts of America for the last over 50 years, they are relocating. In order to permit the proposal we do require a zoning change because this loan property is still zoned manufacturing.

And so we are requesting to bring it into compatibility with the other properties in the area to a dx three downtown mixed use district. We have had for the last over 18 months, we have had ongoing engagement with Alderman Burnett and the 27th Ward office, as well as well as ongoing engagement with the West loop community organization, the neighbors of West loop West Central Association Skinner Park Advisory Council, as well as the Skinner school, and the intercultural Montessori language school. We are happy to advise that as a result of these ongoing engagements and collaborations we do have support from all such organizations and entities, as well as from Alderman Burnett.

One more important thing to know, as a consequence of our ongoing community engagement, the daycare center has adopted a financial assistance program that will provide discounted meals as well as discounted weekly tuition to the residents of the West loop. So with that, I think Alderman Burnett has maybe exited the room for the moment but I do believe that he has tendered his support to the committee, and we respectfully request your support.

[Speaker 1] (1:43:15 - 1:43:21)
Alderman Burnett has informed us of his support of this item. I'll do a little spot I saw your hand up.

[Speaker 7] (1:43:21 - 1:43:47)
Yes, thank you so much, chair. Good afternoon. Good morning yet.

So number one, super beautiful building. Number two, I was curious, the dx dash three zoning classification feels like a really intensive zoning class for what we're looking at I was curious why dx dash three was there not like a business or commercial classification that would work for what we're looking at.

[Speaker 6] (1:43:47 - 1:44:14)
Um, it's not that and Commissioner Murphy if you'd rather take this question, um, it's this part of the West loop is part of the downtown expansion zone. So you, there's not a BRC district to which you can go it has to go directly to the downtown, a downtown district, and the downtown mixed use district, the dash three is actually the lowest and most limited and restricted don't zoning definition in the downtown area that we can.

[Speaker 7] (1:44:16 - 1:44:16)
Fascinating.

[Speaker 6] (1:44:17 - 1:44:21)
And you can articulate that better.

[Speaker 3] (1:44:21 - 1:44:51)
Patrick Murphy Department of Planning, that is correct about the rezoning requests and the classifications they have to go to dx, putting aside the numerical floor area designation afterwards is very permissive from a land use standpoint. So, there could be other districts that could allow for the daycare purposes, but the dash three is the lowest from a bulk and density but it all has to go to downtown, and it is a type one zoning map amendment, so we will be tied to this year.

[Speaker 6] (1:44:51 - 1:44:53)
I can't do any paper.

[Speaker 7] (1:44:55 - 1:45:05)
No, no, no. So that and appreciate and people seldom build schools to tear them down, five years later so I understand it. Lots of lesson learning.

[Speaker 6] (1:45:07 - 1:45:09)
They're very vested in this community for sure.

[Speaker 7] (1:45:10 - 1:45:13)
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, sir.

[Speaker 6] (1:45:14 - 1:45:47)
Alderman Conway, thank you noting this this site is across the street from the 34th Ward, what community groups have you say you reached out to the West Loop community organization, the West Central Association, the neighbors of West Loop organization. Okay, Skinner Park Advisory Council dinner school intercultural multi multi intercultural Montessori school. That's great.

[Speaker 25] (1:45:47 - 1:45:55)
I was making sure that I didn't mean to cut you off I want to make sure the first, the, the, I'd only heard Wilco and I don't think Wilco is doing.

[Speaker 6] (1:45:55 - 1:46:02)
Yeah, it's anymore so I want to make sure as well, I think, WCA and Wilco kind of combined forces.

[Speaker 25] (1:46:05 - 1:46:08)
I don't think that's true but I'm fine with WCA neighbors.

[Speaker 6] (1:46:10 - 1:46:12)
A lot of the members crossed over them.

[Speaker 1] (1:46:12 - 1:46:14)
Thank you.

The applicant is seeking to rezone the property from an M one to limited manufacturing business park district to an RS three residential single unit detached house district. The existing single family residence and vacant lot will remain. The reason for this changes to allow a shared housing unit within the existing single family residence.

We have worked with Alderman Burnett and his office on this matter we also worked with the Garfield Park Community Council, and had a community meeting, all in support of the change. Alderman Burnett was here earlier, not sure if he left a letter or comment, but we're here to answer any questions the committee may have Alderman Burnett has informed us of his support of this item.

[Speaker 1] (1:48:14 - 1:48:19)
Are there any questions. All right, hearing. Oh, Alderman La Spada.

[Speaker 7] (1:48:20 - 1:48:38)
So, I just want to make sure that I grasp it so it's a non conforming single family home. Currently, and the zoning change is to perhaps to allow conversion to a shared housing unit arcade like an Airbnb.

[Speaker 15] (1:48:38 - 1:48:46)
Yeah, essentially yes the single family residence will remain he'll live there still. And yes to allow essentially an Airbnb.

[Speaker 7] (1:48:47 - 1:48:52)
Do we know if this will require require commissioners adjustment to be a CP I'm just curious.

This is number 22116 in the first ward 1703 West Chicago Avenue and this is a B one dash two neighborhood shopping district to be three dash two community shopping district.

[Speaker 13] (1:55:32 - 1:58:07)
Please take it away, Mr. Thank you, Mr chairperson, and good morning still, I guess. And to members of the zoning committee. I'm Richard told them an attorney with offices at 20 South Clark Street in Chicago.

I have with me. The applicant representatives Inaz Melendez and Bradley for a. I'm appearing on behalf of their applicant, Chicago empanada mama LLC.

Regarding the application seeking the zoning amendment from be one, two to be three to the applicant is just opening a brand new restaurant at 1703 West Chicago Avenue. The building itself was is brand new, it was constructed and completed in 2022 by the property owner that was not our project, but the building was designed and built to have a commercial unit on the ground floor. There also are three dwelling units above on the upper three floors.

Our restaurant is in that ground floor commercial unit. The company owner, Inaz Melendez is present with me today she's the operator of the company and the restaurant. The restaurant serves handmade Caribbean empanadas and related cuisine.

The current zoning accommodates a limited restaurant use but our proposal is to have a general restaurant use, which will basically allow a somewhat expanded bar area and bar seating. Alderman other person was spotter was kind enough to host a community meeting for us on the zoning change on April 17 2023. The community was supportive.

With the older persons guidance, the applicant also presented the matter to the West Town Chicago Chamber of Commerce, and that organization provided a letter of support to Alderman La Spada. The applicant also presented the matter to the Chicago Grand Neighbors Association, which also provided a letter of support. The applicant also presented the matter to the East Village Association, which also provided a letter of support with alderman aldermanic involvement.

The applicant also entered into a plan of operations with the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection. And my understanding is that all the person was spotter who of course can speak for himself today. Also happened to provide a letter of support to the committee.

On behalf of the applicant we can answer any questions but we do request your favorable recommendation for passage.

[Speaker 1] (1:58:07 - 1:58:10)
All right. Alderman La Spada.

[Speaker 7] (1:58:10 - 1:58:55)
Hey, thank you so much, Chair. Good. No, we're almost there.

Thank you so much for coming. Thank you for the wonderful work that you all are doing. We talked about a lot of meetings, and I sound like a lot of groups but if you go to the West Town area.

We know our community groups, Chicago Avenue there's kind of a boundary between two of our community zoning partners. So, having more folks feel more comfortable with the zoning change. Also gets the name of the restaurant out which everything you're doing sounds so darn delicious and just so so glad to have you in the West Town community and really hoping for the favorable consideration of my colleagues today.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:58:56 - 1:59:38)
All right. Are there any questions. Seeing none alderman La Spada moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Are there any objections. Hearing none, the item is passed. Thank you so much.

Thank you, Mr. All right, so the final item on page nine was already deferred at the beginning of this meeting. So we're moving on to page 10. This is attorney Mark Kupiec this is number 22185 in the 23rd Ward.

This is 3742 West 59th Street and this is a B one dash two neighborhood shopping district to be three dash one community shopping district and we'll give you an opportunity to get situated.

Thank you Mr chamber chair chairman members of the committee. My name is Mark Kupiec I'm the attorney for the applicant. The applicant Javier Garcia, I have with me today Javier see the next to me and next to him his father one and zoning change involves property 3742 West 59th Street.

The property is currently improved with a commercial building, and actually the property with that building is zone business, but it's only zone B one. And the application is asking to rezone that to a B three. Javier, who coincidentally has an automotive degree from Lincoln Tech plans open up auto auto repair shop in the existing in the existing building plans to work at it himself and his father one is going to help him work in the business.

I've been in touch with the Alderman to describe his plan for the property, and to ask her for her support, and I believe a letter was sent to the committee.

[Speaker 1] (2:00:41 - 2:01:01)
The committee has heard from other women to bars who's in support. Are there any questions from committee members. If not, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

All the women Ramirez moves do pass. Are there any objections. All right, hearing none.

The item is passed. Congratulations Garcia family.

[Speaker 8] (2:01:01 - 2:01:02)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (2:01:03 - 2:01:21)
All right, this next item is number 22169. This is 3004 to 3006 West Belmont Avenue, and this is a seat one dash one neighborhood commercial district to see one dash two neighborhood commercial district. Mr Kupiec.

[Speaker 8] (2:01:22 - 2:02:33)
Mr Chairman members of the committee. My name is Mark Kupiec I'm the attorney for the applicant, and they have with me on behalf of the applicant Nick doubt is seated next to me. This is 30 or 430 or six West Belmont Avenue, actually building property improve with an existing building and zoning change would allow Nick to build a one story upper floor addition to the existing building.

He cooperated with the alderman's community review process, we had a large community meeting, which included representatives from the Avondale Community Association to describe the project. Actually, some of the people who participate in that meeting were pleased that this was the adaptive reuse of an existing building, and he was preserving the existing building adding a floor, as opposed to demolishing the building and build new which is something that they've seen along Belmont Avenue and that in that stretch. And after that meeting Nick followed up with some of the representatives of that group with some additional questions they had, and work with the alderman staff to ask the alderman for her support, which I believe she has communicated.

[Speaker 1] (2:02:33 - 2:02:53)
We have heard from older woman rather the Sanchez and she is in support. Are there any questions from members. All right, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum older woman dowel moves do pass any objections, hearing none, the item is passed.

Thank you so much.

[Speaker 8] (2:02:53 - 2:02:54)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (2:02:54 - 2:03:37)
All right, so we're going to take the next three items so the final item on page 10, and then the first two items on page 11 together since they are related. This is number two to 167 T one in the 36 Ford at 2647 West Augusta Boulevard, and then number two to 161 T one at 2611 West Augusta Boulevard, and then number two to 162 T one at 2641 West Augusta Boulevard, and all three of these are for an RS three residential single unit detached house district to RM five residential multi unit district, and we have Mr. Coopie up here to testify.

[Speaker 8] (2:03:37 - 2:05:16)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. I am the attorney for the applicant, and I have with me today on behalf of the applicant Andrew derisio who seated beside me, and chairman, certainly you're correct. This is related because we've got the same applicant.

For the record, though, for what it's worth these are three separate three separate buildings. Although the same same relief in each case, because each is currently improved with a six flat building. The little twist that our little hardship in this situation is, this is, we're looking for to add a basement apartment in each building, but this is not not an ADU pilot area.

So, we are here, asking for the zoning change because it is it is required. So in each case it's a six flat building, like to add one basement unit to each of those three buildings, and a little bit of the public benefit. Andrew, and two of his partners are military veterans, and they became aware that the Veterans Association has a housing program for veterans in need of housing.

And part of their plan is to accept referrals from the VA, and to allow veterans in some of some of their units. In addition, they also have some experience accepting migrant or refugee tenants from refugee one. And they also plan to accept some migrant or refugee tenants.

Again on referral from the appropriate social service agency. So we would mention that public benefit.

[Speaker 1] (2:05:17 - 2:05:24)
Thank you so much. Are there any questions or comments from committee members. Alderman Lispato.

[Speaker 7] (2:05:24 - 2:06:04)
Great proposal, this is a very 36th Ward zoning change in terms of the intersection with your values and what we want to do. I'm just, I want to name something of which I know the chair the administration the members are acutely aware, which is the phrase, not part of an ADU pilot area is a common refrain that we're hearing. Common refrain, and I know that there's a lot of interest in addressing that and I really look forward to working with the members and the chair on eliminating that phrase from our zoning committee meetings.

[Speaker 27] (2:06:04 - 2:06:05)
Thank you, sir.

[Speaker 1] (2:06:07 - 2:06:08)
Alderman Villegas.

[Speaker 30] (2:06:08 - 2:06:36)
Thank you, Mr. Thank you Mr Chairman. The applicant, when we came to see me, not just talk about it but actually has put it in writing and so there's a covenant that specifically talks to his commitment to making sure that veterans and migrants that are seeking some housing will have a first shot at this and if it doesn't work there's also some language that talks to affordability through an am 80% of am I.

[Speaker 1] (2:06:38 - 2:06:41)
Wonderful. Thank you so much for that great news.

[Speaker 25] (2:06:42 - 2:07:03)
Are there any other questions or comments from committee members Alderman Conway, only like to echo the comments of the of the two gentlemen spoke before me, echoing that we really need to make the CD ordinance citywide, everybody wants it we got to do it. And also thank you as a fellow veteran for what you're doing for for veterans as well having two thirds of the veteran caucus sitting here. We appreciate it.

Thanks, sir.

[Speaker 1] (2:07:04 - 2:07:47)

So, this is a motion to pass number 22167 T one number 22161 T one and number 22162 T one. So Alderman Villegas moves to pass on all three. Are there any objections.

We are here applying for a zoning map amendment to rezone the single family residents from an RS three residential single unit district to an RM 4.5 residential multi unit district. As background the single family residence was constructed in 2016 on or about 2021 the applicants acquired this property for their residents. A year or so later into their residency at the house, the roof of the residents failed and the homeowners hired an architect to prepare plans for the reconstruction of the roof structure.

The architect and performing the due diligence for the plans discovered that the basement was constructed more than 50% of broke above grade, and contrary to the permit set of the plans on file with the city, causing the floor area ratio they exceed the RS three standards. After this discovery the applicant work closely with Alderman walks back the zoning department the Department of Buildings and the law department to evaluate their options to resolve this zoning non compliance. However, it was determined that this zoning map amendment application would be required.

Alderman walk us back to give us a letter. No opposition, and the wicker park committee reviewed this project, and we're supportive of it. And the applicant intends to down zone this property back to an RS three after obtaining the required zoning compliance and the roof structure permit.

Accordingly, I respectfully request this committee's favorable recommendation for approval of the zoning map amendment as amended to a type one and I'm happy to answer any questions.
