[Speaker 16] (26:48 - 26:51)
Erin Feldman, please press star six to unmute.

[Speaker 1] (26:52 - 26:52)
Thank you.

[Speaker 17] (26:56 - 28:59)
Hi, this is Marilee Feldman. My son, Aaron, was going to give this comment, but got called into a meeting and wanted to ensure his comment was heard, so I'll be reading it. So here goes.

Hi, my name is Erin Feldman, and I'm here to advocate for the expansion of the ADU program citywide. In a survey sent out by Urban Environmentalist and Streets Blog last year, the vast majority of alders that responded supported ADUs. Of the 23 alders that responded, 21 supported ADUs.

If this is indeed the case that most alders support ADUs, I see no reason why we shouldn't act promptly to expand the ADU ordinance. Not only are ADUs seemingly popular amongst a healthy amount of alders, but they are politically popular with over 800 people signing a petition to expand the ordinance. And it's no wonder that ADUs are popular, as they offer multiple benefits, including naturally affordable housing, as ADUs provide a new housing option for young adults, retirees, and small families.

They also allow aging in place, as elderly individuals can downsize while staying close to family and friends in their neighborhood. ADUs also allow for multi-generational households, so people can have family support nearby while maintaining personal spaces. ADUs also provide rental income.

This additional income stream can help prevent the displacement of low-income homeowners and retirees on fixed income. ADUs provide gentle density, which provides new housing in existing neighborhoods without impacting its appearance. Lastly, ADUs are climate-friendly.

Building new homes in existing neighborhoods lets more people live in walkable communities. It simultaneously reduces demand for sprawling greenfield development that destroys natural habitat and encourages driving. New construction ADUs are also highly efficient and often all-electric, leveraging clean technologies such as heat pumps and induction radiators.

[Speaker 1] (29:00 - 29:04)
Thank you, Ms. Feldman. Next up, we have Hunter Heyman.

[Speaker 12] (29:04 - 29:06)
Hunter Heyman is not present.

[Speaker 1] (29:07 - 29:16)
All right, we'll move to the folks in the room. I have R. Coyle, followed by Stephen Vance.

[Speaker 47] (29:27 - 30:26)
Hello, my name is Raymond Coyle. I'm vehemently opposed against the development of 5400 North Ashland. It is essentially a monument to greed.

We want to change the zoning. The zoning there is a problem because of the parking and the flooding. They're demanding fewer parking spaces.

They want no setback. Again, it's greed, greed. The guy moves into the neighborhood and wants to change it.

If you like the neighborhood so much, why do you want to change it? The alderman refused to meet with his constituents, and we tried several times, but he met at least three times with the developer. This was not a good process, so much for transparency.

Let me see. The flooding is a big problem, and it's the one-way street on Balmoral is going to be a problem. The people coming from north and south are going to put extra burden on the streets around it.

And that's basically all I have to say. We are very much against this building.

[Speaker 1] (30:31 - 30:38)
Thank you, sir. Next up, we have Stephen Vance. Thank you.

[Speaker 18] (30:39 - 32:40)
Hello, my name is Stephen Vance. I am a resident of Chicago and a land-use consultant. In two weeks, the city will reach the three-year anniversary of when Chicagoans could start applying for building permits to build ADUs, otherwise known as accessory dwelling units.

In that time, the city has permitted approximately 237, comprising 275 new ADU homes. 75% of those will be in basements or already are in basements, and a little less than 20% will be in backyard or coach houses. 11% of these homes are required to be rented at affordable rates set by the Department of Housing each year.

That means that we have 275 new homes that are or will be providing housing for family members, providing new income for property owners, and picking away at the city's housing shortage of 120,000 homes. But the opportunity is not available to everyone, and the number of ADU permits issued each quarter has been declining since December 2022. City Council adopted five pied areas, a limitation that does not need to stick around.

Hundreds of currently interested property owners are prohibited from building an ADU. The current alternative is to undertake a costly zoning change just to gain the privilege of building one or two more units on their properties. I also operate Chicago Cityscape, which is a real estate information website that gives a tool for people to look up if they are in a pilot area.

As of last week, people have looked up 815 addresses on that lookup tool, and 70% of them got a rejected or a no answer that they are not allowed to build an ADU. So I believe that those permitting statistics in decline and the lack of availability to build an ADU because of the pilot areas means that not enough new homes are going to be able to get built, especially the types of homes that allow Chicagoans to modify their properties to age in place, fund the property taxes they have to pay, or move a family member to be closer. I also want to say this is on Mayor Johnson's Cut the Tape Phase 2 initiative, so I think it's a priority of the city.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (32:40 - 32:46)
Thank you. Up next we have Jan Bollig, followed by George Blakemore.

[Speaker 48] (32:49 - 33:41)
My name is Jan Bollig, and I'm a longtime resident of the neighborhood, and my sister and my mother, who also lived, who is no longer living, at 1620 Balmoral, which is within 225 feet of the proposed BMX that is being built at 5400 block. I'm not sure of how the rules were followed, but I know that there was not much notification about a rezoning application and then the change in the rezoning application, and I want to speak for my sister and for my family to say that we do not need this large building that will overtax the neighborhood and ruin its residential flavor. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (33:42 - 33:45)
Thank you very much, Ms. Bollig. Mr. Blakemore?

[Speaker 48] (33:46 - 33:46)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (33:46 - 33:48)
Followed by Harry Rorkind.

[Speaker 31] (33:51 - 35:50)
I'm angry. We did three minutes. Last time when they drove me or dragged me out like a Georgia slave, there was all Hispanics here.

And the last class said, we're going to cut it down to one minute. The rule says three minutes in the committee. You don't have power to change the rule.

And especially when the demographic is women, all men and whites are mixed. You change the rule. The rules are the rules.

If you get three minutes, that's what we're supposed to get. It's not left up to your discretion. So you see all these white folks here now, and you're going to let all of them speak, and you're going to steal one of my minutes.

And that makes me an angry black man. You want us to obey the rules. When you all changed the rules, you became white men.

And Mexicans changed. Y'all make the rules. Now what are the rules?

Three minutes or two minutes? Anyway, racism is right here. It's mostly right here, all white folks.

You got the right one in the mic. I'm speaking about the Fariga Theater. That is the only historical item on the agenda.

And how Michelle Harris and the others have denied our people to develop that site. And you're going to have that deficit to come up and change the minutes. Who in the hell do you think you are?

Or who do you think I am? If the rules are three minutes, I won't mind.

[Speaker 1] (35:54 - 36:18)
Thank you, Mr. Blakemore. Sir, thank you. Have a seat.

Mr. Roarkind, followed by Brian Peterman. Oh, and just for the record, we've been joined by Alderman David Moore and Alderman Brian Hopkins. Mr. Roarkind?

[Speaker 52] (36:19 - 36:48)
Yeah, I'm opposed to the property at Ashland and Belmoral. I feel it's too large for the space, too high density, not enough parking. I'm not opposed to developing the community or a size larger building going in there than the zoning, which is single family.

But the one they're planning is way too tall, way too big, but no setbacks whatsoever. And the limited parking they're allowing is going to allow a lot more spaces in the street to be taken up. So the density is too high and the building is too tall.

Okay.

[Speaker 1] (36:49 - 36:54)
Thank you, sir. Brian Peterman, followed by Catherine Gemperling.

[Speaker 26] (36:57 - 38:56)
Hi, my name is Brian Peterman. I'm a homeowner in the 47th Ward in the North Pilot Zone. I'm here to share my support of the accessory dwelling units.

In the pilot program, I completed a coach house in October. This gives space for my mother-in-law to live in a cost-controlled home, as well as maintain her freedom and independence. All of this was in preparation for my firstborn, who came in November.

My family is happier and healthier because we're able to have a multi-generational family together. Additionally, our coach house has allowed us to invest in Chicago and break the cycle of young parents leaving the city for the suburbs. I'm very fortunate to have the financial ability to build a coach house.

With three modifications to the pilot program, I believe that we'll be able to have coach houses that are more affordable, more accessible, and better investments. Number one, removing the accessory parking requirements. By having parking requirements, we have increased the cost of coach houses by at least 25%.

It also doesn't allow for an accessible coach house because we have to have the garage on the first floor and the living space above. This makes it difficult for my mother-in-law to live in place and continue to stay in that as her needs change. Number two, remove the square footage cap.

Having a 700 square footage cap disincentivizes investment. In general, because 40% of coach houses' costs are fixed costs. This would include new water, new electrical, new sewer service.

Increasing a coach house from 700 to 900 square feet really doesn't increase the cost very much, but it really changes the living experience for the person who lives in that coach house. Third, expand the ADU program citywide. We're in the midst of a housing crisis in Chicago, and we need to build more apartments.

Building more apartments citywide will also lessen the property tax burden on those, in your words, who are struggling. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (38:56 - 39:04)
Thank you, Mr. Peterman. Catherine Gemperle will be followed by Joseph Messimara.

[Speaker 24] (39:06 - 41:07)
Good morning. I'm Catherine Gemperle, the founding president of the Edgewater Historical Society. We developed a vacant firehouse across the street from the property at 5600, I'm sorry, 5400 Ashland.

Well, it took us many years. From 1996, we opened in 2002. We know a lot about Edgewater.

Edgewater is a very dense community. It's the second most dense community in the city. There are only 5.3% of the buildings in Edgewater are single-family homes. The West Andersonville community voted to downzone everything in their community to R3 so that we could keep at least some single-family homes accessible to a variety of people. What has happened here is that the developer has proposed two different buildings. The second building was not really reviewed by the entire West Andersonville community.

And it is really way out of scale for a multi-unit building. Most of Edgewater lives in multi-unit buildings. Many are on corners.

And this building, although it is attractive in design, is just way out of scale for our building across the street, the buildings to the north of it, and even the buildings to the west. There is no real setback. And people who live in apartments really need some outdoor space, maybe just to sit on a lawn chair.

So without a setback and with the limited parking available, this is really a pressure on the community. Thank you.

[Speaker 54] (41:08 - 41:09)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (41:15 - 41:21)
Next up we'll have Molly Fleck. Joseph, go ahead. Pronounce your last name for us.

Hi. Joseph Miscamara.

[Speaker 56] (41:22 - 41:22)
Okay.

[Speaker 29] (41:23 - 43:11)
Yeah, my name is Joseph Miscamara, and I'm a resident of the 32nd Ward. I'm speaking in support of expanding where accessory dwelling units, or ADUs, are legal, primarily because I happen to live in one. My house is a lovely three-story coach house behind a two-unit building separated by a courtyard patio.

Since it was built before the city banned ADUs in 1957, my three roommates and I share a home in a vibrant, walkable neighborhood without paying expensive rent. It's fantastic, and I think more people should have the freedom to live in a home like this. However, ADUs are still banned in most of Chicago.

Changing this would improve the quality of life for all residents, and there's three main reasons why. ADUs are good for affordability, families, and the planet. First, if we allow residents to build more types of housing in neighborhoods of all kinds, we can prevent high-pressure bidding wars and displacement of long-time residents.

The most effective way to keep housing costs low is to just build more homes. The second reason is that ADUs open opportunities for families to live closer together. This can allow people to care for elderly or disabled relatives, which is especially important considering that the area's number of residents over the age of 75 is estimated to double by 2050.

ADUs also make it easier for multigenerational families to share responsibilities for children, easing them of high child care costs. Third, ADUs are good for the planet. By allowing people to move closer to where they need to travel, their emissions plummet, especially from transportation, and I am living proof that this is true.

Once I moved into my current house, I was able to sell my car, and I now get around by bike, bus, train, and foot. My carbon footprint is much lower, and best part, I'm not contributing to traffic. So if you're a neighbor, you can thank me later, but let me wrap up.

If Chicago expands access to accessory dwelling units, we can secure housing affordability, bring families closer together, and mitigate environmental harm. I want that, and you should too. Thank you for listening.

[Speaker 1] (43:12 - 43:16)
Thank you. Next is Molly Fleck, followed by Tom Meyer.

[Speaker 16] (43:17 - 45:23)
Good morning. My name is Molly Fleck, and I live in Lincoln Park. I'm in the second ward.

Good morning, Alderman Hopkins. It's currently illegal for me to build an ADU on my property where I live. I'm here to speak in support of the proposed ADU expansion, because I think that this will benefit our city by increasing the supply of housing, both market rate and affordable, and it'll increase property values and flexibility for homeowners like me who would like to build an ADU.

Chicago faces a critical shortage of both market rate and affordable housing. Just this morning, I saw some research indicating that Chicago is estimated to build 26,372 rental units between now and 2029. That puts us at 31st in the nation behind much smaller cities like Columbus and Richmond.

If Chicago is going to get serious about housing insecurity and the homelessness problem that we face in this city, we need to open up every possible avenue that we have for building housing, and ADUs are a tool that we are leaving in the toolbox. ADUs provide flexibility to homeowners. With the extra space, they can decide what they want to do.

They can rent it out for extra income, hire an au pair for childcare, have relatives move in with them, or use it to launch a small business. I live in a neighborhood that's full of old coach houses where hundreds of people have lovely homes. I don't think anyone can accuse Lincoln Parkers of being quiet about their concerns about neighborhood character, and the fact that homes with rentable coach houses always advertise that fact very prominently in real estate listings shows that ADUs are popular and very desirable, even if they're not called ADUs.

I had a conversation recently with a neighbor at my son's preschool's parent mixer. He and his wife have four children. They're committed to raising their family in the city, but they are bemoaning the fact that childcare is so expensive.

If only we could hire an au pair, we would save thousands of dollars, but we can't build an apartment over our garage. Why can't he? Why can other neighbors build garages with rooftop decks, which is the new amenity du jour among luxury housing?

What's really the difference between a coach house built in 1890 and an ADU built in 2024? If an owner wants to be able to build an apartment on their property, I think they should be able to do so. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (45:23 - 45:27)
Thank you, Ms. Leck. Next, we have Tom Meyer, followed by Amy Masters.

[Speaker 51] (45:28 - 46:16)
Hi there. I'm a community member of West Andersonville, where the proposal is 5,400 North Ashland. I'm a community member of West Ashland, where the proposal is 5,400 North Ashland.

I'm against the proposal. The development will be a Godzilla on the street, taking away light and shattering other properties and causing flooding. The developer's penthouse and private terraces will be towering over the street.

I'm opposed to this development. I'm for affordable housing, but we can do better. We can do things that fit into the scale and architectural scale of the neighborhood.

We can do better. Please, aldermen, go back to the community and let's talk to us about what we really would like. It's been overwhelmingly opposed by the neighborhood.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (46:17 - 46:24)
Thank you. Amy Masters, followed by Austin Kudrowski.

[Speaker 35] (46:25 - 48:02)
My name is Amy Masters. I am the Director of Government and External Affairs for the Building Owners and Managers Association of Chicago, or BOMA Chicago. Good morning, Chairman Lawson and members of the committee.

BOMA Chicago enthusiastically supports the appointment of Marlene Hopkins as Commissioner of the Department of Buildings. Our association has represented the Chicago office industry since 1902. Membership includes 245 commercial offices, institutional and public buildings, and 200 companies that provide commercial building services to support operational excellence.

BOMA Chicago members make up 80% of the downtown runnable office market and 98% of the Class A buildings downtown. Throughout Marlene's tenure at the Department of Buildings, we have had the privilege of collaborating closely with her and her department. Over her extensive 25-year commitment to the city, Marlene has consistently showcased her technical expertise and operational leadership, crucial for effectively overseeing the department.

Marlene has cultivated a strong partnership with the commercial office industry, characterized by her responsiveness, transparency, and determination to tackle challenges that impact the downtown market. The vitality of downtown commercial projects, crucial to the city's economic well-being, relies heavily on strong leadership in the areas of permitting, inspections, trade licensing, and code enforcement. For these reasons, we heartily support Marlene's nomination.

Marlene has the technical know-how, institutional knowledge, and work ethic to be a successful commissioner. We applaud Mayor Johnson for this appointment and urge the committee to vote affirmatively. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (48:02 - 48:09)
Thank you, Ms. Masters. We have Austin Kudrowski, followed by Jerilyn Fallon.

[Speaker 19] (48:10 - 50:15)
Hi there. My name is Austin Kudrowski. I'm here as a member of Urban Environmentalist Illinois, and I'm here to advocate for the expansion of ADUs for all of Chicago.

As far as I am aware, they're only available in five pilot areas of Chicago, and we should open it up to the rest of the city. On October 26, 2022, 15 Chicago City Council members filed an ordinance that would allow ADUs citywide. Since then, support has only grown for ADUs.

Let's revisit that ordinance and vote to allow ADUs citywide. At Urban Environmentalist, we launched a petition right after that 2022 proposed ordinance to gauge support for ADUs. I'm proud to report that over 800 people have signed it.

I want to read you some of the comments from the people who signed the petition. From Paula. Yes, indeed, I support ADUs.

I volunteer with a nonprofit that serves meals and provides clothing and other necessities to persons without homes, so I know how deep the need for affordable housing is. Please, City Council, allow more ADUs citywide. From Brian, who currently lives in an ADU.

Would love this opportunity to add more coach houses to our community and legalize more basement apartments. They provide me with affordable housing when I first came to Chicago. From Elena.

We would love to see more diverse housing in our neighborhood. From Josh, a developer. We plan to build two next year in a zone where we are already in, and we'd love to do more.

From Steven. There is clearly demand for homeowners and landlords to build ADUs across Chicago. When property owners outside ADU pilot areas want to build one to two extra units, they're obtaining zoning changes, which add time and cost to the process.

By expanding the ADU policies citywide, we can generate more lower-cost new housing without subsidy a little faster. From Anna. We need citywide ADUs by right to bolster affordable housing, increase the number of smaller apartments available, increase density to support neighborhood businesses, allow grandfathered coach houses to be renovated for safety, and more.

Thank you. Thank you for your time.

[Speaker 1] (50:15 - 50:21)
Thank you. Up next is Gerilyn Fallon, to be followed by Nick Sem.

[Speaker 20] (50:22 - 52:24)
Hello. Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Gerilyn Fallon.

I'm an attorney. I represent myself, my family, and the neighbors who are impacted by the development at 5400 Ashland, file number 22398-T1, 5400 North Ashland. You've already heard from many of my colleagues here and neighbors.

At least seven of us, if not more, are here today to speak. We represent at least 38 people who have signed petitions against this development and dozens more who have submitted written letters to you and to your members. This development is opposed, and because of the zoning, this is an application for a zoning change from RS3 to a BS3 zoning.

There is no reason for this committee to grant that applicant's change of zoning. First of all, there is no valid acceptable hardship the applicant can show that might compel the zoning committee to approve his zoning changes. He can build within the existing RS3 zoning whatever building he chooses.

He can build up to six units in that building. He can make them whatever he wants them to be. But what he's asking for is a change to build a building that is also a bait and switch.

Initially, the design was five stories tall. Now it's four stories tall, when all the other buildings in the area are only three stories tall. Not only is it out of proportion to the neighborhood, the buildings on either side of it, north and south, are only two stories tall.

The building behind it, a six flat, is only three stories tall. In fact, all the buildings in this residential area are only three stories tall. This building at four stories will tower over all the buildings in the neighborhood and will not allow us any other opportunity.

[Speaker 1] (52:25 - 52:35)
Thank you, Ms. Fallon. Next is Nick Semm, followed by Matthew Keene. And last speaker will be David Myers.

Thank you. Sir.

[Speaker 27] (52:36 - 52:38)
Hi, my name is Nick Semm.

[Speaker 1] (52:38 - 52:40)
A little closer to the mic, please. You'll have to tilt it up.

[Speaker 27] (52:40 - 54:38)
There we go. My name is Nick Semm. I'm the owner of Gray Street Renovation Lab, a value-add real estate development firm specializing in gut rehabs of two to four unit rental apartment buildings.

Based on my experience as a developer, urban planning enthusiast, and affordable housing advocate, I believe expansion of the ADU program citywide will yield significant benefits to developers, homeowners, renters, and the city of Chicago generally. The benefit to developers. My firm's investment guidelines mandate each project add at least one legal unit of housing to ethically justify a project.

With certain exceptions, our investment guidelines can only be achieved within the ADU pilot zone. Without the ADU pilot program and adding that legal unit, most of our rehab projects would not be economically feasible and would not have occurred. Personally, if the ADU program is expanded, I have plans for two new coach houses with projects that are currently outside the ADU pilot zone.

This will add two much-needed lower-cost rental units, provide my architect with two new projects, provide my general contractors and all their subcontractors with two new projects they otherwise would not have. Skipping to the benefit to the city of Chicago. Chicago is last in unit creation in top 10 metropolitan statistical areas, and units were built at less than half of the national pace in 2023.

Truly a disappointing statistic. Allowing owners and developers to add housing units to the existing infrastructure will necessarily improve this statistic. Finally, properties where ADU units are constructed will increase the appraised value of these parcels, thus increasing the overall city tax base.

Particularly important in light of the issues facing commercial real estate in the downtown corridor. Thank you for your consideration. Please expand the ADU program citywide.

[Speaker 1] (54:39 - 54:43)
Thank you, Mr. Serra. We have Matthew Keene, followed by David Myers.

[Speaker 23] (54:44 - 56:42)
Thank you, Alderman. My name is Matthew Keene. I am a resident of Lakeview, and I wholeheartedly support expanding the ADU ordinance citywide.

The combination of 200 plus unit West Loop style mega developments, as well as Chicago's abundant, naturally occurring affordable housing, have protected Chicago from the just awful real estate situation that we're seeing in other large cities around the country over the last couple of decades. But in the environment that we're in right now, it's rising interest rates, and you're seeing the pace of that development slowing. And then what you have is you have 79% of the city zoned for single family homes.

So naturally, we're limiting the capacity of what can be developed. And so we need to stop thinking about some of these larger scale developments and create a true market condition-proof approach to affordable housing. So by legalizing ADUs citywide, on those 79% of single family zoned plots, we'll create the ability for property owners, should they see fit, to meet demand in their individual markets to build units that will allow for an increase in supply, which is an essential component of any affordability strategy.

Legalizing ADUs also will help keep multi-generational families together and will allow working class property owners and rapidly gentrifying neighborhoods to build an additional unit to create income to offset some of the increases that they see in property taxes. And finally, just as someone who lives in a pilot area, the effect on neighborhood character, the effect on parking, the effect on everything around me has been so minimal that I actually had to double check that I did live in an ADU pilot area. So I think concerns about neighborhood character are overstated.

And I think this won't solve all of our issues with affordability, but will be a positive step in the right direction if we legalize these citywide. Thank you, and hope you have a great rest of your week.

[Speaker 1] (56:42 - 56:45)
Thank you, Mr. Keene. And finally, David Myers.

[Speaker 28] (56:49 - 58:37)
Hi, good morning. My name is David Myers, and I'm speaking in opposition to the proposed building at 5400 North Ashland. I'm a resident of Andersonville.

I love Andersonville. I love the neighborhoodness of Andersonville. I've lived in other more densely packed areas of the city, and I want to preserve the beauty of our neighborhood as it is right now.

This developer is asking for an exception to the zoning rules. There's a point to the zoning rules. It's supposed to preserve the quality and the character of the neighborhood.

I'm all open to making more affordable housing. However, to me, the irony here is you're going to destroy the quality of a nice neighborhood in your effort to bring more people into it. I don't believe more dense is better all the time.

There's got to be another solution to this. It's going to cause a lot of problems. It's a much bigger building than what is currently in the area.

It's a precedent. If this is allowed to go on, it's going to get worse and worse. In addition, it's like, again, you know, parking is always a huge challenge for us here in the city of Chicago.

This is just going to make things worse and worse. There's already another commercial building going up about a block away that's going to take away about 40 parking spaces. There's also another theater that's going to be going up that's going to take more parking spaces.

You can always say this is just one building, it's just one little thing, but really it's taking away the quality of our neighborhood bit by bit, and I don't think it's justified to say we want to make more affordable housing at the price of making it a less desirable neighborhood. Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (58:40 - 59:39)
I just wanted to recognize we have Alder Vasquez and Alderman Hoppenworth, non-members here for attendance, and also Alderman Mosley has requested to move from in-person to remote means under the provisions of Rule 59. Alderperson Fuentes makes a motion by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum to approve that request. Any objections?

Hearing no objections, Alderman Rodney Mosley is attending the meeting by remote means. Welcome back, Rodney. All right.

Moving on to the agenda, the first item up is document number A, 2024-0008369, the appointment of Marlene Hopkins as the Commissioner of the Department of Buildings. All committee members will find a copy of her resume as well as three letters of support in the packet before them. We have Ms. Hopkins here today with us. Go ahead and say hello.

[Speaker 2] (59:39 - 1:04:16)
Good morning, Vice Chairman Lawson and the honorable members of the Committee on Zoning, Landmarks, and Building Standards. I am Marlene Hopkins, Acting Commissioner for the Department of Buildings. First and foremost, I would like to thank Mayor Brandon Johnson for this appointment and the members of the City Council for this opportunity to speak before you today.

I've had the distinct pleasure of working with many of you and I am honored to present my qualifications and experience to this body. Before I tell you about myself, I want to say how grateful I am for the dedicated Department of Buildings staff who have the incredible responsibility to come to work each day to protect the health, safety, and welfare of all Chicagoans through the enforcement of the Chicago Building Code, whether it is permitting, inspections, or trade licensing, I am honored to work alongside these men and women every day. Prior to my appointment to Commissioner for the Department, I served as First Deputy since 2020 and Managing Deputy Commissioner since 2007. As a longtime leader for the Department, I have made it my mission to be responsive to all Chicagoans, city staff, and officials around the clock to address building-related incidents.

Throughout my 17-year tenure with the Department of Buildings, I have overseen day-to-day operations for the 290-employee department, including a team of inspectors encompassing multiple building trades responsible for performing technical and administrative permit reviews and inspections, building code enforcement, trade licensing procedures, and overall crisis response to building incidents. Under my leadership, we have integrated numerous technical and administrative efficiencies, including electronic devices for inspectors to input inspection outcomes in the field, online systems for vacant building registration and trade license renewals for electrical, plumbing, and mason's license contractors. We have also streamlined the inspections required for business license administration.

In addition, we've reduced the number of grievances and arbitration hearings through collaborative work with the labor unions and created built-in communication protocols to work collaboratively with many city departments and officials, as well as federal, state, and county agencies to provide crisis services for Chicagoans in response to building-related emergencies. The department is committed to Mayor Johnson's Cut the Tape initiative for affordable housing and business development through the use of self-certification permitting and a team-based inspection process. We can reduce the time to permit and inspection for residential construction of affordable housing and commercial construction.

We will continue with the upgrade of our antiquated permitting and inspection system known as Hanson 7. This upgrade has four phases of which two of the four have been completed. Moving forward, the Department of Buildings remains committed to working with the full force of government protecting the health, safety, and welfare of the public, preserving quality of life, and contributing to economic development.

Mayor Brandon Johnson encourages us to prioritize community engagement through an equity lens to help determine the best way we can provide safe and affordable buildings for Chicagoans. This is an ongoing priority for the department and I will continue to implement internal and external efficiencies through upgraded technology and other means to reduce time to permit, being responsive, and improving customer service. As a lifelong Chicagoan, I am committed to fighting for those who lack the resources to fight for themselves through aggressive enforcement of the health and safety standards set forth in the Chicago Building Code and will work with our community partners and stakeholders to explore new initiatives to further improve the quality of rental housing.

Again, I am honored to be before you today and thank you for your consideration of my appointment. I am happy to answer any questions you may have. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:17 - 1:04:30)
Thank you, Commissioner. We have a few folks here in the box that are going to say a few quick words of support and I know you're in order. Do you have the microphone?

Great. First up is the Honorable Presiding Judge Leonard Murray.

[Speaker 54] (1:04:41 - 1:04:43)
Testing. There we go.

[Speaker 25] (1:04:46 - 1:04:46)
Good morning.

[Speaker 54] (1:04:47 - 1:04:47)
Good morning.

[Speaker 25] (1:04:48 - 1:06:51)
My name is Leonard Murray and for the past seven and a half years I've been the Supervising Judge in the Wiscow Housing Court. It's a misnomer. What my division deals with every day is health and safety as it relates to all of real estate in the city of Chicago, every inch of it.

I've had the pleasure during a period of time of meeting and working with this very young lady, Marlene Hopkins. I have been encouraged to engage with her inspectors on a daily basis. In fact, we have an on-site inspection scheduled for this Friday out on the north side on Montrose Avenue in the condominium development.

She's an excellent person, professional, has an iron fist and a velvet glove. We do the right thing in the right situation. I am totally pleased and honored by being asked to speak on her behalf this morning.

I support her nomination for this position. It's overdue. She's overqualified.

Just a wonderful person to deal with on a daily basis and I am honored that her elevation to this position will benefit the whole city of Chicago. What we do every day, I tell this corny joke to my friends, the reason that your ceiling didn't fall in on you last night while you were sleeping in your apartment or your house is because of building codes. So what we do in our department every day, every moment is we enforce the building codes.

Everything from health and safety to structure to electrical to plumbing, HVAC, that's what we do. Marlene Hopkins has been at the forefront of that effort for the past seven and a half years. I'm at her side, not at my side.

I do what she tells me to do for the most part, but sometimes we have to do what the law requires. So thank you for your time and attention. Please vote yes on her appointment.

Thank you so much.

[Speaker 1] (1:06:51 - 1:06:53)
Appreciate it. Next up we have Pastor Cruz.

[Speaker 8] (1:06:59 - 1:10:17)
Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests, my name is Daniel Cruz, Senior Pastor of Faith World Church for the past 33 years. It is with great pleasure that I stand before you today to express my deepest gratitude and appreciation to a remarkable individual who has gone above and beyond to help our church in particular in its time of need. I'm talking about none other than Marlene Hopkins, whose confirmation hearing, as we know, is taking place today for Commissioner of the Chicago Building Department.

Marlene's dedication, commitment, and hard work have truly made a difference in the completion of our church's new sanctuary. As we all know, obtaining construction permits can be a daunting and time-consuming process, but with Marlene's help, it was a smooth and efficient process She worked tirelessly to ensure that all the necessary permits were obtained in a timely manner and that our project followed all the building codes and regulations. Not only did Marlene help us with the process, but she also provided valuable insights and suggestions that helped us improve our plans and make our new sanctuary even better.

Her expertise and knowledge were truly invaluable to us, but what truly sets Marlene apart is her kindness and compassion. She understood the importance of our project to our church and our community, and she went out of her way to make sure that everything ran smoothly. She showed genuine care and concern for our cause, and that meant a lot to us.

Thanks to Marlene's efforts, we were able to complete our project on time, and the opening of our new sanctuary was a huge success. Our congregation now has a beautiful and safe and comfortable space to worship and gather, and we owe it all to God above all and to Marlene's hard work and dedication. On behalf of our congregation of close to a thousand congregants, I would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to Marlene.

Your selfless service and unwavering support have made a significant impact in our community. We are truly blessed to have you as a part of our journey. In conclusion, I would like to say that Marlene Hopkins is a true hero in our eyes.

We are forever grateful for her assistance, and we will always remember her kindness and generosity. Thank you, Marlene, for all that you have done for us. May your kindness continue to touch the lives of others, and may you be blessed abundantly for your selfless service to our great city and to the faith community in general.

Thank you, everyone, for your attention, and I am in support, our church is in support, and please vote yes.

[Speaker 1] (1:10:18 - 1:10:21)
Thank you, Pastor. Next up, we have Don Finn from Local 134.

[Speaker 32] (1:10:21 - 1:12:07)
Good morning, committee, chairman. As you can see, most people have remarks they've made up and they've had them on their paper. I don't have to have that today because this is coming from my heart and from my mind.

My name is Don Finn, and I represent the 12,500 electricians in the city of Chicago and Cook County. I have had the privilege to work with Marlene for over a decade right now since I was put in my position. What some people have hit on and some people haven't, Marlene, when she says she works long hours, it's not uncommon for me to get a phone call at 930 at night.

And when you see the city of Chicago coming up on your phone, you're like, oh, my God, what's going on? But it's Marlene, and it's a comforting voice saying, you know, this is an issue over here, we have to address it. Obviously, we have a lot of people that work for the city of Chicago.

We have a lot of people that live in the city of Chicago. But what they haven't hit on, and maybe the pastor did a little bit, what Marlene has done in the community, helping guide young African American and Hispanic people into our trades, not just electricians, but all the building trades. The work she's done through her church, that goes unnoticed because she doesn't talk about it.

When she needs something, she's there for us, obviously, and we're there for her. But I think one thing we're missing here is, you know, I know a lot of crazy stuff goes on in this room a lot, and I know there's a lot of argument and a lot of tense stuff goes on. But if you want a person with transparency, you want a hard worker, and you want someone to take care of the city of Chicago taxpayer number one, you've got the right person in Marlene Hopkins.

So I urge you to vote yes. I support Mayor Johnson's pick on this, and if you have any questions, obviously, most of you have my cell phone, feel free to call me. But Marlene, nothing but the best to you, and I look forward to you as the commissioner.

[Speaker 1] (1:12:07 - 1:12:10)
Thank you, Mr. Finn. Next up, we have Lola Chin.

[Speaker 33] (1:12:16 - 1:12:20)
Mayor and council members, thank you for selecting Marlene Hopkins.

[Speaker 1] (1:12:20 - 1:12:26)
Ms. Chin, please. Hold the microphone closer to your mouth. We can't hear you.

There you go.

[Speaker 33] (1:12:27 - 1:14:02)
Mayor and council members, thank you for selecting Marlene Hopkins as our building commissioner. There is no doubt that she will work tirelessly to make permitting efficient inspections fair and hold those who violate building codes, making buildings unsafe to live in, and those who violate gang and drug house ordinances responsible. Each of those areas require constant supervision to make sure the law is applied even-handedly and fairly and sometimes cooperation with sister agencies.

It is not always easy to see the real situations on the street. Marlene is a dedicated civil servant who serves all Chicagoans fairly over the decades. It has been my good fortune to have her working to support city lawyers, police, the inspector general, and other sister agencies to make buildings and neighborhoods safer in Chicago.

My misfortune is to live in the 28th Ward, 11th Police District, which is one of the worst neighborhoods in Chicago. The 11th District high crime stats bear out that residents are not safe. There is very little market rate housing development and business development over the past 50 years.

Note the last 30 years in a boom town in north and east side neighborhoods because of cheap and easy interest rates passed by the 28th Ward, which has had almost no development at all.

[Speaker 30] (1:14:51 - 1:16:40)
Good morning. I'm Ryan Rivera. I'm the commanding fire marshal.

Please don't judge me. I do have a sheet of paper. I'm old and I forget.

I work with the Office of Fire Investigation and I've worked with Marlene for quite some years. She's definitely made a positive impact on the city and the Chicago Fire Department. Since I've known Marlene Hopkins, she's been one of the great assets of the city of Chicago.

As first deputy of buildings, she has been instrumental in keeping the citizens of Chicago safer by aiding the Chicago Fire Department. Rain or shine, she has been there to answer the call. Three in the morning doesn't matter, does it, Marlene?

I must congratulate her on her confirmation as commissioner of building department. All the citizens of Chicago should be proud and applaud Marlene's appointment as a building department commissioner. She has been the go-to person within the Department of Buildings for the Office of Fire Investigation, aiding our complex, large-scale investigations.

I know some of you have called me and emailed me. She's been the reason we've been able to get to the answer. Cooperation with the building department has been key in acquiring the assets and equipment needed for our extensive fire investigations that require heavy equipment.

She has cut through the bureaucracy to streamline the process of addressing derelict and abandoned buildings that are a danger to the public. She and her staff are consummate professionals. Marlene Hopkins has always been professional and courteous, but more so a pleasure to work with.

Her gracious personal demeanor has been steadfast regardless of the chaos in front of her. Marlene Hopkins will continue to be a driving force of good, getting things done in the city and the citizens of Chicago. I say congratulations again, Marlene Hopkins.

[Speaker 1] (1:16:40 - 1:16:46)
Thank you, Chief Rivera. Next up is Edgar Diaz from AFSCME Local 2946.

[Speaker 37] (1:16:48 - 1:18:22)
Good morning. My name is Edgar Diaz. I'm a staff representative for AFSCME Council 31.

Normally, you would see our Intergovernmental Affairs Director, Adrienne Alexander, here, but she's in Springfield this week. But I'm here in support of Marlene Hopkins becoming commissioner for the Department of Buildings. In the seven years as a staff representative, I've had the pleasure of getting to know Marlene in her prior role as a first deputy commissioner and our labor liaison.

In my time with the union and representing the members in the Department of Buildings, it's gone to show how the impact of a relationship that's been built and being able to communicate effectively, along with having the mutual respect and ways to achieve department's goals and the union's goals over the years has improved. As a result in a better understanding of what our members struggle with and with finding resolutions together that are mutually beneficial through productive labor management meetings. Less grievances have been filed, which has helped foster a healthier environment for all the employees in the department.

I can say without a doubt that Marlene Hopkins treats the Department of Buildings as her second family. She goes above and beyond for all her employees, whether it's being out there in the trenches, helping employees balance work and child care, or even giving me a call to let me know that she's at the hospital with one of our members so that we can follow up with our member to provide the help with the resources we have available. She's always there for her employees.

In the labor movement, we always want to try to improve on our existing contracts. Having Marlene as Commissioner for the Department of Buildings will help improve the department to become better than where it is today. Thank you for your time and I look forward to seeing Marlene as Commissioner.

[Speaker 1] (1:18:23 - 1:18:26)
Thank you, Mr. Diaz. And finally, we have Richard Townsell from the Lawndale community.

[Speaker 42] (1:18:28 - 1:20:03)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Richard Townsell and I serve as the Executive Director of the Lawndale Christian Development Corporation and I'm a resident of the 24th Ward. I'm here to testify, I know there's not a lot of testifying in here, but I'm here to testify on behalf, in the affirmative, for our dear sister Marlene Hopkins as Building Commissioner.

I have three reasons. One, integrity. Proverbs 22.1 says, a good name is more desirable than great riches. To be esteemed is better than silver or gold. Before I met Marlene Hopkins, I knew her name. A good name is hard to find in this town.

Her yes is yes. Her no is no. She don't do sideways talk.

She operates with personal integrity. Number two, she's a problem solver. In our history, we've done about $125 million in development.

There are log jams that happen every day in real estate projects. She brings people together to solve problems, not merely point them out. She uses her power to move the city forward.

We need people like that that get things done. And finally, customer service. She is focused on the customer, the end user.

We have building apartments on the west side, we call it the west side, and 19th and Pulaski, and she came out herself with her team to figure out problems because she's more focused on people than rigid rules. Ultimately, our customer is people, and you've got to love people to want to do this work. She has our unequivocal support.

Please vote yes. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:20:04 - 1:20:14)
Thank you very much, Mr. Townsell. We'll now go to questions by committee members. I'm going to start with Alderwoman Harris, who is joining us on the Zoom.

[Speaker 22] (1:20:17 - 1:22:18)
Thank you. I'm honored to be here today for a young lady who I think is the best at what she does in the city of Chicago. For my 17 years here, Marlene has been the person who's been my go-to.

I go to her, I can call her morning, noon, and night, and she's responsive and takes my calls. You can't ask for more than that. She has such thorough knowledge of our building code, got thorough knowledge of our permits and inspections and demos.

That's just to name a few. She is, if I can coin the expression, she is the building commissioner. She knows so much about the building department, she probably could write several books.

Today, I am thoroughly happy to have her as the mayor's. This is a great decision on the mayor's part to put her in this position. She will be great for the city of Chicago, and I can say she's been great for the 8th Ward.

She's the boots on the ground. On any given day, if I can pop up anywhere in my ward, I might see that building department over there looking at something or checking on something. I am grateful and honored at this time to say that I give her my 10,000% support.

I know she will be just what the city needs to handle our building department needs. Again, thank you Chairman Bennett for allowing me to speak on her behalf. Acting Commissioner Marlene, congratulations.

I hope that everybody supports you because you have worked very hard to get to this point in your career to have a flawless career. Thank you and I appreciate you all so much. Again, everybody needs to vote for Marlene.

[Speaker 1] (1:22:19 - 1:22:22)
Thank you Alderman Harris. Next, Alderman Beal.

[Speaker 36] (1:22:25 - 1:24:03)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I rearranged my entire day to make sure I could get down here today. I would be remiss if I did not get down here to support Marlene Hopkins.

I've known Marlene, I don't want to say how many years, but we've been in the trenches a long time in this city, and I can tell you without question, she has been the commissioner for the last 15, 20 years because we don't call the commissioner when we had Marlene. I can tell you without question, I always called Marlene instead of the commissioner because I knew if I called the commissioner, the commissioner was going to call Marlene. I just cut straight to the chase.

In my eyes, you have already been the commissioner for years. It's finally your time. It's finally your time to get your just due, what you're owed.

Because you were owed this a long time ago, and we all know you were overlooked. But today, your star is shining, rightfully so, because you are the building department. No matter what time of day we call, what time of night we call, you're the one that's there.

You're the one to come out to the fires, the building collapse, porch collapse. It's always you. So just continue to do what you do, continue to shine, and we are blessed to have you finally getting your just due.

So thank you so much. God bless you, and I support you wholeheartedly. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:24:04 - 1:24:12)
Thank you, Alderman Beal. I'm going to put Marlene on the agenda every month so we get a little better attendance out of you, okay? Next up is Alderman Hopkins.

[Speaker 43] (1:24:12 - 1:24:55)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm in full support of this nomination. We don't always value experience in city government with the level commensurate that it should have, but in this case, it's obvious.

Marlene, everything you've accomplished, you know the city so well, you know city government so well, you know City Hall so well. There's literally no one better prepared for you than to assume this role, and this is a strong appointment by the mayor. I'm pleased to support it.

By the way, if any of my colleagues here are considering voting against this nomination, change your mind right now. You don't want to be that one person. This needs to be a unanimous acclamation for this appointment.

Good luck, Marlene. We look forward to working with you. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:24:55 - 1:24:57)
Thank you, Alderman Hopkins. We have Alderman Moore.

[Speaker 6] (1:24:59 - 1:26:08)
Thank you, Chairman. When I was a tough kid in Inglewood, I was going to beat up Alderman Beal, and he said, I know Marlene Hopkins, so I gave him a pass. As you all know, just this past weekend, we laid to rest a beautiful servant in Karen Yarbrough, and when I learned doing her service, as much as I knew her, I didn't know her, and how much she, so much added value, and it's so unfortunate that we find out about those things so late, and I say that to say that as well as your resume presents itself and what you do from a building standpoint, a lot is missing. A lot is missing, and if you can tell us, Marlene, Assistant Commissioner Hopkins, Acting Commissioner now, how long have you worked for the city of Chicago?

[Speaker 2] (1:26:09 - 1:26:12)
I've worked for the city for 26 years.

[Speaker 6] (1:26:12 - 1:26:15)
And where did you start out working at the city?

[Speaker 2] (1:26:15 - 1:26:23)
I started as a staff assistant working for the Department of Aviation in 1998 under the leadership of Mary Roselone.

[Speaker 6] (1:26:23 - 1:26:27)
Did you have your degree at that time? I did not. Where did you go from there?

[Speaker 2] (1:26:28 - 1:27:54)
I went from aviation to the Chicago Housing Authority, where I served as a special assistant. I went from there to the sewer department, where I worked as an executive assistant, learning all about sewer infrastructure, and then came to the Department of Building as an executive assistant, learning all about building, constructions, inspections, was instrumental in working alongside with creating the Department of Construction and Permits, where Mayor Daley wanted to separate permitting from inspection.

Worked in that department for over a year, went back to the airport as a project manager. At that point in time, I went back to school to begin my studies for my bachelor's degree. I left aviation and returned to the Department of Construction and Permits when the mayor appointed Richard Rodriguez as the executive director of DCAP, continued my education for my bachelor's.

We consolidated permitting and buildings together in 2007, at which time I successfully completed my bachelor's degree in organizational leadership. At that time, I was promoted to managing deputy commissioner and have worked in the department for the last 17 years, and I completed my master's of legal studies in criminal justice from Trinity Law School last May.

[Speaker 6] (1:27:55 - 1:28:38)
Man, we got so many of them and I haven't done that, right? But when we talk about, are you perfect? No.

But from your history and what you just told, you're a person who strives for perfection. Always. And that shows in the work that you do.

Dawn, you said something, and I want you to, Commissioner, elaborate on that. And it is your service that you do in the community. I have a, my pastor used to say, people shouldn't do anything to be seen, but they should be seen doing something.

And I think that's what Dawn Finn was alluding to. Tell us some of the things that you do in the community.

[Speaker 2] (1:28:40 - 1:29:56)
Responding with my inspectors when they encounter living conditions for residents that are concerning to them. And I go out to do an assessment to try to determine what resources we can provide to that individual to make improvements to their homes. I respond to fires at all hours of the night with my partners in the fire department when they call for an immediate response.

I also respond when we have major incidents with cars that go into buildings that impact the owner's or the occupant's ability to stay in the property. I also go out on permit inspections with my inspectors. I do vacant building inspections with my inspectors.

I do all of the inspections. I've been on all of them. So I'm always out in the community making a difference.

When we have problem buildings that are on the blocks, and we have individuals who have opted to take over a vacant property, I work collaboratively with the police department to not only have those individuals removed, but if the building is structurally compromised, making that determination that that building needs to be demolished so that we can stabilize the block and the people on the block and their quality of life is improved.

[Speaker 6] (1:29:57 - 1:31:08)
Commissioner Hopkins, I recall a situation. I think it was either a day before Christmas or a day before Thanksgiving. I think it was a day before Thanksgiving where a building had flooded in the 17th Ward.

And there was people making decisions about having people evacuate and go somewhere else just a day before Thanksgiving. You had to make a call between having those people move or having them stay. But what I realized that you did, you put first safety first and then compassion.

Safety first and then compassion. And how often are you faced with those situations? Because there were people, and I mean strong people, strong will at Christmas ready to take your head off, and the fire department's head off, and my head off, and everybody's head off.

How often do you have to make those decisions? And how do you, as a commissioner, make those life-changing decisions?

[Speaker 2] (1:31:08 - 1:31:47)
It's hard to keep count with how many times I have to make those decisions. But what I always do is I approach it from the perspective of, what if this was me? How would I want someone to handle me?

I would want someone to go above and beyond to find a way to stabilize the situation so that I would not be disrupted. So as you said, Alderman, safety is always paramount. But there is always a way to work with the partners in all of our city departments to find solutions to enable residents to not be displaced if we can pull together all of our resources to make that difference.

[Speaker 6] (1:31:47 - 1:32:16)
And my last question, Chairman, I call certain situations opportunities. What opportunities have you, what are your most, you know, greatest opportunity that you've seen in the building department? Some people call them challenges.

I call them opportunities because it's an opportunity to do right. It's an opportunity to excel. What opportunities have you seen in the past?

And what's the opportunities that you see in the future for the building department?

[Speaker 2] (1:32:17 - 1:33:48)
Well, the opportunity in the future to continue to work collaboratively with all of our city departments. I'm really excited about working with Commissioner Boatwright and Commissioner Castaneda as we really work collaboratively together on affordable housing because we all realize that that is something that is very essential. As all of you know, there are a significant number of vacant buildings that are throughout the city that we have orders of demolition on because no one ever stepped forward into court to express an interest.

But that doesn't mean that those buildings need to be demolished. And so we are really looking forward to working on a forfeiture program through the court system that will enable us to put those properties into the hands of individuals that can reinvest in the community to stabilize it. Looking back and looking at some of the things, some of the opportunities, I would have to say one of the ones that really stands out the most is the collaborative relationship with the fire and the police department.

Because one of the things that has been pointed out to me in the past is that we never had a really close working relationship. But thankfully, because of the people being in the right seats at the right time, we've been able to really come together as a team. And it's not that's fire, that's buildings, that's police.

We're a team together. And we're out there dealing with the situation real time and making decisions real time to ensure the safety and the well-being of everyone.

[Speaker 6] (1:33:49 - 1:34:11)
Thank you so much. And I only concur with Alderman Brian Hopkins in saying that anyone that does not support this is definitely on an island by themselves. And I commend you for the work that you do and that you're going to continue to do.

Marlene and I emphatically thank the mayor for this appointment and definitely going to vote yes. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:34:12 - 1:34:14)
Thank you, Alderman Moore. Next is Alderman Conway.

[Speaker 50] (1:34:18 - 1:35:13)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We'd just like to briefly echo my colleagues and Commissioner Hopkins, everyone who has worked with you talks uniformly about your expertise and your knowledge and your leadership and your accessibility. And in a place where we tend to argue a lot here in the city of Chicago, you seem to be the only thing consistent is that everyone says that uniformly about you.

And additionally, I had unsolicited several of my Springfield colleagues reach out to me. Apparently, you're the subject matter expert that they reach out to also. So I don't know how you find the time, but maybe there is something to you being overqualified for this position.

But I greatly appreciate you taking this on and look forward to working alongside you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you for taking this on again.

Commissioner Hopkins.

[Speaker 1] (1:35:14 - 1:35:16)
Thank you, Alderman. Alderwoman Clay.

[Speaker 41] (1:35:18 - 1:36:25)
Good morning. It is a pleasure to see each other in person. You would be surprised how much we've been in communication and have not been able to just physically see each other.

But I have to echo my colleagues in saying that you have been a huge help to a new alder like myself. And my ward is heavily dense. I have buildings of all shapes and sizes.

And when problems erupt, you have been a phone call away. It has been a breath of fresh air for you not to just pick up the phone, but to have solutions, right? There are tons of phone calls I've taken that have just been a phone call that have not come with any solution.

But you come to the table with so many solutions and so many ways to address a problem. So I appreciate you for that. I also just wanted to ask one question because I think that this is something that I've taken away.

What are some of the preventative measures that we could be taking as alders? Or what are some of the resources at our fingertips that we could be using through the Department of Buildings when people come to us with issues regarding their own housing?

[Speaker 2] (1:36:27 - 1:36:57)
So there's not a one size fit all answer because everything is going to always be case by case. But what I will say to you, Alderwoman Clay, is that I'm always a phone call away. And we can always work together on a solution.

I just think that there's not a blanket how to. That's the one thing about the building department is everything is different. Every situation is different.

And what works for one property may not work for a different one. So it really is important just to handle it case by case.

[Speaker 41] (1:36:58 - 1:37:17)
Yeah, appreciate you. I appreciate you handling every case that I've brought to your feet diligently. I am so excited for you to be in this role.

You're the only commissioner I've ever known to be in this role. And you've handled it beautifully. So I'm so excited to work together and see all of the exciting, amazing things you'll bring to the city.

Thank you. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:37:17 - 1:37:20)
Thank you, Alderwoman Clay. Up next is Alderwoman Dowell.

[Speaker 21] (1:37:21 - 1:39:01)
Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Marlene, when the mayor made the announcement of you to become the commissioner of the building department, you can believe it, I jumped up for joy. I think this is long overdue.

You definitely are the right person at the right time for this job. You know, they say everybody has a season and your season is now. And it's been, you had the season before, but unfortunately it didn't work out.

But this is your time. I just want to underscore what Richard Townsell said about integrity. You have that and much more.

I want to thank you for always being available. You are timely. You help us figure out solutions, whether we're calling about a vacant building or a fire, you're there right there in the community.

We see you. When we have concerns about board ups or just breaking through the permit process, we can call you, email you on the weekend, during the day, at night. And our situations are solved right away.

I wish you well in this position. I know you have the respect of your staff. And I urge my colleagues, as Alderman Hopkins did, to give you a unanimous thumbs up for this role.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:39:02 - 1:39:03)
Thank you, Alderwoman Dowell. Alderwoman Cruz?

[Speaker 9] (1:39:07 - 1:42:12)
Thank you, Chairman. I also want to say that I support this appointment. I want to echo something my colleagues, Alderman Clay, is thank you for helping.

Also, another newly elected to this role. I remember reaching out to the prior commissioners saying, who's my contact at building? And I have been blessed to have you because you have been there throughout the way with calls, as everybody says, text message early, late.

You have been there. But I want to highlight one of the situations we had in the 30th Ward, where you were there with me along the way, and we treated this situation with care, you know, addressing somebody who needed help, not only in his house when it comes to utilities, but also mental health assistance. And you and other departments that were there, we all treated the situation with care.

We took it, you know, again, making sure that this individual was taken care of the right way. So I want to appreciate you being there, walking me through the process, explaining how things will work, so in order for me to be prepared that day to deliver that help that is needed. So that I will never forget, but also many different calls throughout that we have been in communication, but also giving me the opportunity to have some of those conversations that we needed to have on certain issues.

And you were great. We had several conversations. And I appreciate how honest and open you were when it comes to say that, you know, there's things that happen, and this is what happened throughout the conversation.

But again, just wanted to say that. And also, you have people that are very supportive of you in the 30th floor. They have called residents.

They have called it and have texted me. And I'm going to read a little bit of one that's sent in. Actually, that stuck with me a lot.

And one of the things he says is, far too often, women and women of color are held to a higher and more particular standard than others who, due to class, ethnicity, gender, might have historically been given a pass. And that is very important when I see you being there. And to say that we are not perfect.

There's things that, you know, we learn from it, and we move on. And those are the things that, you know, was based on our conversations that we have seen. But also, he said, she's not one to make a promise that she can't keep, but also is willing to strive to deliver the best that she can out of any request.

And through all these conversations of the rest of my colleagues, it's exactly what we keep hearing often from you and how you like to prepare to how to be better in your role. And I think that we have to highlight what you have done, and we appreciate that you are in this role, and you be guiding us through a lot of different change that we need in the building department that you're fully aware as well. And look forward to be a partner with you and continue having those conversations.

So again, congratulations. And again, I fully support this appointment.

[Speaker 1] (1:42:13 - 1:42:15)
Thank you, Alderwoman. Next is Alderman Riley.

[Speaker 40] (1:42:16 - 1:43:49)
Thank you, Chairman. Good morning, Acting Commissioner. Just wanted to thank you for all of your help over the years.

You know, you took a position of leadership at the department the exact same time Alderman Dowell and I got here back in 2007. And I want to echo the comments made by my colleagues that there's no doubt you're a subject matter expert. And clearly, in the Central Business District, we have lots of challenges, and you've been a real asset in helping us deal with those.

So I want to thank you for that. I'd also like to thank you for your responsiveness to my office and my staff. Like many of my colleagues here, you work, you're responsive to us, and you work around the clock, and I appreciate you for that.

I want to flag one thing for you that came up in a different hearing in the past week, and that is related to hopefully prioritizing an online payment portal at the Department of Buildings. I know that that's a technology challenge for the department, but it's my hope that working with your new counterpart over with IT, that that's something we can prioritize. I know that's something that you'd like too, but just know that you have support from the City Council in helping make that happen as soon as possible.

So that said, like all of my colleagues, I want to congratulate you in advance for your confirmation, and I look forward to supporting it. And thank you, Chairman Lawson.

[Speaker 1] (1:43:50 - 1:43:52)
Thank you, Alderman. We have Vice Mayor Burnett.

[Speaker 10] (1:43:54 - 1:46:03)
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. So I've known you your whole career, Marlene, and I've seen you make everyone else shy from behind the scenes. So it's long overdue that you get your opportunity to shy.

I'd like to commend the mayor on this appointment. You've always been very responsive. I myself have called you all times of the day, and you jumped to it, and you're very personable.

I mean, you get a lot of times, instead of just sending other folks to do it, you go do it yourself. So I really appreciate that. And I hope that the things that we'll put into the cut the tape will work, and hopefully you make it work.

Your department is not only good for safety, it's also good for development. It's good for economic development, and we've got to keep that in mind. The more cranes we have up, the less taxes we have to pay, right?

So we need to help make sure that permits and all those things get through the process efficiently so that we all can benefit from it here in the city of Chicago. I know you would do that. You've been in a position.

You've worked under how many commissioners now? Six. Six commissioners.

Yeah. Right? So it wouldn't have done any good for you to get a new commissioner and have to teach them what to do too, right?

So thank God that the mayor saw fit to allow you to have a spot. I commend you. I know you don't have to be here.

I know you can leave right now, right? So I just want to thank you for staying on and not taking that opportunity to serve the public. So I know this is a real sacrifice for you to continue on.

I know where you were, right? And so I just want to say thank you for staying. We appreciate you being here, and congratulations to your support this appointment.

[Speaker 1] (1:46:04 - 1:46:06)
Thank you, Vice Mayor. Alderman La Spada.

[Speaker 14] (1:46:08 - 1:47:13)
Hey, thank you so much, Chair. Thank you so much, Commissioner Hopkins, for being here with us. I just want to piggyback off of Vice Mayor Burnett's comments on the cut the tape work, because it's not about a slogan, and it's not about a really interesting report.

It's about these on-the-ground realities that result in businesses opening in three months or six months, projects moving forward in 12 months or 18 months. And what I love is that you get it. Like, you cannot fix a bureaucracy until you understand it at its deepest level.

And I'm glad that you do. And I'm glad that you understand, as a lot of us are learning or have learned, that it's no big flashy thing, as you and I talked about. It's 101 different unsexy, non-headline-grabbing changes that make a city work in a more effective way.

And I'm genuinely thrilled to have you as a partner in that work. Thank you so much for being with us. Thank you, Chair.

[Speaker 1] (1:47:13 - 1:47:20)
Thank you, Alderman. We think it's sexy. Right, we do.

All right, all right, all right. Alderman Villegas.

[Speaker 44] (1:47:21 - 1:48:32)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I wanted to add on the accolades. My staff texted me and said, hey, you better say something nice, because Marlene has been someone that our offices leaned on over the last three terms.

I'm really excited to see you in this position. I know you've served under multiple commissioners. I'm really excited to see what it is that you're going to be able to implement.

Because I know that sometimes as the second person or the third person in charge, you're like, I wish I could have that authority to do this. Well, now you're going to have it. And so we're looking forward to working with you.

I look at your department as one of the economic development departments. We need to make sure that we're getting projects permitted quickly so that we can create revenue and realize revenue in that fiscal year. Right now, we're looking at really some hard times that relates to construction with approximately three or four cranes scheduled for 2024.

And I think that your department is going to be able to be that department that really puts and signals to developers that we're open for business. So we're excited about your experience. We're excited that you've decided to take this position.

And again, we're looking forward to continuing to work with you and see what comes along. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:48:33 - 1:48:38)
Thank you, Alderman. Alderwoman Mina Hoppenworth. And I believe that's it.

[Speaker 12] (1:48:39 - 1:51:09)
Thank you, Chair. Thank you, Acting Commissioner, for being here. And I commend the mayor for your appointment.

And I am grateful that you are staying. As the Vice Mayor said, that continuity of care is really important, especially at your level. And as a freshman, I appreciate all the work that you have done with us in the 48th Ward.

As you know, we've had our challenges, especially on Sheridan Road with troubled buildings and fires. And I appreciate your collaborative efforts to really help center those who are impacted by these, especially our older adults and those with disabilities and working class people who feel like they don't have any power when something like that happens to their home. And they want to stay.

So we want to prioritize those folks that want to stay. And we really appreciate all your help towards that end. My Director of Neighborhood Services has been talking about you since last year in a way that it makes sense to me now when I'm hearing all my colleagues talk about your many years of working with you, because you know how it works and you know how we can make things better.

And so, again, I appreciate you staying. I also agree with Chair Villegas and also Alderman Riley that we need to modernize our online data portal system to accelerate development. And so thank you for your commitment to that.

And I also, as a woman of color and someone who is learning how things work here, I appreciate the words that Alderman Cruz said. It is not easy being in these spaces for the first time. And I also want to echo Mr. Townsville's words from Christian Londale. And he said, I knew her name before I met her. And I just love that. I'm so inspired by you.

And I can't wait to continue the work together. So thank you. Thanks, Chair.

[Speaker 1] (1:51:09 - 1:52:49)
Thank you. Thank you very much. I think that's everyone.

I will say, just to close, I think this is the most time you and I've spent at City Hall together, because we're typically in my office. I know you're rather insistent on me meeting there, or we're at Wrigley Field or somewhere on Allstead or at a building site. And so you're not wearing your boots today, but I know most days you do.

And we appreciate that as someone, you know, we're all in the field and that you're that way. I also want to just thank you for some of the discussions we've had around vacancy and the need to look at owner-occupied structures differently than we do. You know, investment vehicles, because there's value there and to stabilize those homeowners or the three-flat owner that's living there.

Talked a lot about ADUs in the public comment. We'll get to that as well. But also just on the Cut the Tape initiative.

I think we're going to be seeing you back here at committee with your team on a number of those things that the Council's really, really excited about. Something I know, and you know, because we've both been around a long time. There's been a lot of talk about that, but not always so much action.

And I think that the action we've seen so far has been really impressive. So thank you for everything that you've done for our city so far. I think we all wish you the best in your tenure, finally, as Commissioner.

I got you, David. No other question. All and more moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none. The appointment is passed.

Will be reported out tomorrow. Congratulations, Commissioner.

[Speaker 54] (1:52:53 - 1:53:04)
Well done. Well done. We didn't even get any real questions.

All right. Next.

[Speaker 1] (1:53:06 - 1:54:54)
She still has her key card. That's what I have mine. That's what staffers do, right?

All right. Next is document number 2023-2075 to introduce a substitute ordinance that expands the city's ADU policies. All committee members should have received a copy as well as a summary electronically.

There's a packet, a copy of the packet in front of you. It was indicated on the agenda. This item is listed so that we may accept the substitute on the record, but there will be no discussion or vote today on this matter.

With that, do I hear a motion to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? All in the spot, it moves to accept. Any objections?

Hearing none. The substitute has been accepted. Also, then Vice Mayor Burnett makes a motion to defer the previously read item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, the item is deferred. Just on this matter, I know I've spoken to a number of my colleagues already and wanted to hear from everyone on it.

I would anticipate a subject matter hearing, perhaps next month, and then continue discussions toward passage at some point, hopefully this summer, if we can do that. So stay tuned and appreciate everyone's work on that item and the comment today. Moving on, we have one historic landmark designation, document number O, 2024-000822, the historical landmark destination for Apollo 2000, located at 2875 West Sermak Road in the 24th Ward.

We have Matt Crawford of the Historic Landmark Division of the Department of Planning and Development here to present on the matter. Thank you.

[Speaker 15] (1:54:54 - 1:57:07)
Thank you, Chairman. Good morning. Matt Crawford with the Department of Planning and Development.

I'm also staff to the Commission on Chicago Landmarks, and that body has recommended to Council that Apollo 2000 be designated as a Chicago landmark. Apollo 2000 is located on Sermak Road in the Little Village neighborhood. The structure was built in 1917 as the Marshall Square Theater, and it screened silent films accompanied by orchestra and vocalists.

In 1929, the theater transitioned from silent films to talking pictures. As the neighborhood transitioned to a Latino population in the 1960s, the Marshall Square began offering Spanish-language films. But by the 1980s, the supply of new films from Mexico was drastically reduced, which led to the closure of the theater.

The closure of the Marshall Theater in the 1980s was not unusual. So many neighborhood theaters closed in the mid-20th century. What's remarkable here is that the building avoided demolition, and its survival is really credited to the current owners, the Galindo family.

Javier and Lydia came from Mexico, and they purchased this building in 1989. And in 1990, they rechristened it as Apollo 2000, and they have successfully converted it into an event and performance venue that has become really a cultural hub in the Latino community. To convert the former theater into a concert, dance, and event venue, you can see the interior included some renovations, including removal of the original theater seating, and the slope floor was reconfigured with multiple levels.

But you can see that they have also preserved the overall architectural quality of that great historic movie theater. So the Galindo family is here. They have requested the Chicago landmark designation.

They have consented to it. They're excited about this. Alderwoman Scott has also indicated her support for the landmark designation.

So that's the recommendation. Before you, happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (1:57:08 - 1:59:16)
Great. Thank you, Matt Crawford. We do have a letter of support from Alderwoman Scott.

Do we have any questions by committee members on this one? If no questions, Alderperson Fuentes was due passed by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, the ordinance is passed. Thank you, Matt. Next are large signs over 100 square feet in area, 24 feet above grade.

We will hear them all together. I will read the ward followed by the address and take a motion at the end. Two signs in the 44th ward located at 900 West Nelson.

One sign in the 45th ward located at 5160 North Northwest Highway. One sign in the 47th ward located at 2156 West Montrose Avenue. If no questions by committee members, do I get a motion to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

Alderman Spada moves to pass. Any objections? Hearing none, the orders are passed.

We will now move on to the map amendments. As a reminder, in an effort to ensure the committee meeting will run as smoothly as possible, items will be grouped together according to witness and will be heard in that order rather than ward order. We're going to defer this first item.

Item number A, 8831 in the first ward. Ordinance referred, 41923. The common address is 1416 North Maplewood.

Change request B23, neighborhood mixed-use district to RS3, residential single-unit detached house district. Alderman Spada makes a motion to defer the previously read item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, the item is deferred. Next up is item number A, 8871 in the 26th ward. Ordinance referred, 32023.

Common address is 3508 West Armitage Avenue. Change request B33, community shopping district to B23, mixed-use district. We have Alderperson Fuentes.

[Speaker 45] (1:59:20 - 1:59:28)
This went through the proper community engagement process and my zoning committee, and so we support the zoning matter.

[Speaker 1] (1:59:29 - 2:00:21)
Great. Any other questions by committee members? Great.

If no questions, do I hear a motion to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderman Knudsen moves to pass. Not on our own, probably, right?

Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed. Next up is document number 22398-T1 in the 40th ward.

Ordinance referred, 32024. Common address, 1606 West Balmoral and 5404 North Ashland Avenue. The change request is RS3, residential single-unit district to B23, neighborhood mixed-use district.

There was quite a bit of discussion on this one earlier, and I know there's correspondence in your packets as well. We have the attorney, Tom Moore.

[Speaker 7] (2:00:22 - 2:03:13)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is, for the record, is Thomas S. Moore, and with me today is Josh Bradley, who, through his company, is the developer here.

Josh has a degree in civil engineering and a master's in construction management and has spent the last 13 years for major companies being a supervising construction manager in a variety of high-profile projects in the city. And in more recent years, he's developed several properties up on the north side and is himself a resident of an area just east of this location and has actually lived in this location the last couple of years, is a member of the West Andersonville Neighbors Together WANT Association and has gone through an elaborate process with the alderman and the community has met with WANT a couple of times in the Chamber of Commerce a couple of times and had a community-wide meeting. The project has gone through many changes. It was a five-story project.

There are other four-story projects, which just a block south of here on two of the four corners have four-story and the third corner has a B23, just like the request for this one. So it's not really, it's on Ashland, which of course goes from one end of the city to the other is a busy street. And it's just two blocks from the commercial center of Andersonville and it's got both the Ashland bus and the Clark Street bus.

So it's ideally located to put some density near the commercial center there and near the transit location. There is almost no affordable in this immediate area. This 15-unit project would have three on-site affordable units and it, as I say, has been through the community process.

One of the changes was it started out as a modern building. Besides lopping off a floor, it now has a, as requested by the neighborhood, a more traditional design and we have the support of the alderman and we'd request your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (2:03:14 - 2:03:19)
Thank you, Mr. Moore. We see on the agenda that there's an administrative adjustment as part of the type one as well.

[Speaker 7] (2:03:19 - 2:04:12)
There actually is two. To reduce the, there's only room on the back of this double lot for seven parking spaces. So one of the two administrative adjustments would be to move from eight to seven to reduce it by one.

And also because there is a residential district to its north, we need a transitional side yard and there still will be a six, 8.9 feet of side yard, but we need to reduce it because of when you have a transitional, it, you have to give half of the residential side yard. So even though it's a, will be a B district, which requires no side yard because of that technicality, we also need that administrative adjustment.

[Speaker 1] (2:04:13 - 2:04:18)
Great. Thank you. Alder Vasquez.

Thank you, chairman.

[Speaker 3] (2:04:18 - 2:09:27)
So I appreciate the feedback we got from our neighbors. I just want to walk through some of our colleagues as far as the process, because I know there was some lively public comment. And so I wanted to cover all of it.

So our 40th award process when it comes to zoning matters is we get a proposal submitted about a couple of weeks from that point. We have a meeting, it's a zoom meeting for accessibility. So neighbors that are able to make it and neighbors who physically aren't able to make it can jump on the call.

At that point, the developer will present the proposal. Neighbors can then ask questions related to that proposal. From there, we have another two weeks for people to fill out a form to then give our office the feedback.

Based on that feedback, we land on decisions, either it's in support or opposition. Most of the time it's support. Some of the time it'll be opposition, but we tend to read the feedback related to why people oppose it.

So for this one in particular, we had the first meeting November 28th. Based on the feedback received, we've got about 300 to 400 different responses. It seemed close to evenly split, but the challenge became understanding the different opposition.

So some of it was on the aesthetic. They didn't prefer the way it used to look. Some of it was based on height.

They felt five floors was too high. They wanted to come down. There were some concerns about density in parking as well.

And some people wanted more affordability. I think when we look at different parts of town, what we have to do to get affordability in the 40th Ward, which is not normally an affordable part of town, is looking at the ARO. Because the ARO only provides 20% of anything seeking a zoning change that's over 10 units.

A six-unit property would not yield any affordability. So initially, what was proposed was 18 units with four ARO. The height would have been 66 feet with nine parking spots, five floors, obviously 60% AMI average.

Because of the feedback we received from different neighbors along different reasoning for opposition, we could not support that. So on December 20th, we responded with an initial note of intent that said we could not support it. However, if the developer were able to kind of meet some of the concerns, which were the height, the density, the aesthetics, that we would be able to find some level of agreement that people could move forward on, we submitted a proposal on January 5th.

That is the one you see before you referred to as a behemoth in relation to the rest of the neighborhood. I just want folks to be able to look at the picture. I know when you hear the public comment, it felt like Sears Tower was getting built on the corner of Balmoral and Ashland, as you can tell next to the properties right next to it.

Yes, it goes up about a floor higher. It is on a major arterial street. It is on a transit organic development area.

So taking all those things into account, it is a modest increase. And so what was proposed in the second proposal was instead of 18 units, 15 units. Instead of four affordable, three affordable.

So we lost an affordable unit in the exchange. Instead of 66 feet, down to 57 feet. Parking spots, instead of nine, it would be seven.

Again, AMI would be the same. I think looking at what's proposed, it led to a compromise that we could get to supporting. I will say when we talk about the lack of affordability, some of the folks who had concerns were saying, well, they're going to build all these other condos and this is going to be not affordable.

But we know if it was six units, none of those would be affordable. This at the very least gains us three in an area that I believe needs to be more reflective of the rest of Chicago. It needs to be economically diverse as well as racially diverse.

I think this is an opportunity. So when I hear our neighbors say that we don't believe affordability is justification for quote unquote ruining the neighborhood, I don't think it actually speaks to the majority of our neighbors in the 40th Ward as well as in the area. That being said, we did want to hear the feedback which led to the compromise here.

So we would be in support. We sent the updated notice of intent of support for that one on February 1st. And then to the neighbors who said that we didn't meet with them, we met with them.

We had a meeting on March 26th, even prior to this meeting to have the conversation, so much so that I recognize our neighbors that were here. I think it's always going to be challenging. But if people want to look at the fact that we have a cut the tape a proposal from the city that would eliminate all parking minimums, that we're looking at the fact that we want to have more affordability, what this led to which we appreciate is a conversation about actually looking to upzone the rest of the neighborhood in a way that might be more modest but broad in order to have more affordability. So yes, we are in support.

I apologize for going so deep into our process, but I want to make sure it's on the record and our neighbors know because we do not operate like old school Chicago when it comes to these community meetings or how we land on these opinions. We would be in support and I'd ask for our colleagues' favorable consideration. Thank you very much, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:09:28 - 2:09:46)
Thank you, Aldervazquez. Any questions by committee members on this one? Seeing none, if there's no questions, do I have a motion to do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

All in the spot of moves do pass. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

[Speaker 7] (2:09:46 - 2:09:48)
Thank you very much. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:09:53 - 2:10:20)
Top of page three. Document number 22370-T1 in the 50th Ward. Ordinance referred to 1624.

Common address is 2701 through 15 West Tuey Avenue. Change requests. B31, Community Shopping District to B23, Neighborhood Mixed-Use District.

Also included is an adjustment and variation under the type one. Here to present is Nick Fitikas.

[Speaker 11] (2:10:21 - 2:10:50)
Thank you, Chairman. For the record again, Nick Fitikas from the Law Offices of Sam Banks. I am here on behalf of the applicant and property owner, Azad LLC.

The applicant is proposing to develop the property with a new four-story residential building that will contain 43 units and 45 parking spaces. This is a type one zoning change application. We actually did file an amended application as well as an amended narrative.

So I'd ask that the narrative be incorporated into today's proceeding.

[Speaker 1] (2:10:51 - 2:11:02)
Thank you. Alderman Kutz moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine forum. Any objections?

Hearing none, the substitute narrative and plans are accepted.

[Speaker 11] (2:11:02 - 2:11:30)
And then with respect to that additional relief, we are no longer seeking the administrative adjustment. That's part of the amended narrative. However, we are seeking the variation for the rear setback.

That rear setback is a reduction for the first floor of the building. I believe it takes the rear property line to one foot four. I'm sorry, the rear setback to one foot four inches.

The three stories above grade will all be set back to 30 feet. And again, that is reflected in the plan set.

[Speaker 1] (2:11:32 - 2:11:39)
Great. Thank you. Questions by committee members?

Actually, I do. So what's your affordable number here?

[Speaker 11] (2:11:40 - 2:11:44)
So the affordable is actually 8.6. So it's nine that'll be provided on site.

[Speaker 1] (2:11:44 - 2:11:45)
Nine on site. Excellent.

[Speaker 11] (2:11:48 - 2:11:48)
Great.

[Speaker 1] (2:11:49 - 2:11:49)
Sharp looking building.

[Speaker 11] (2:11:50 - 2:11:58)
Of course, we did meet with Alderman Silverstein. Yes. Participated in two community meetings.

And we believe we have her support to proceed today.

[Speaker 1] (2:11:58 - 2:12:03)
You do. We have a letter of support from Alderman Silverstein. Yes, Alderman Espada.

[Speaker 14] (2:12:04 - 2:12:13)
Hi, thank you so much, Chair. So I'm just trying to make sure I fully understand it. Are we looking at the 2E facing?

Correct.

[Speaker 11] (2:12:13 - 2:12:14)
That's the 2E front right now.

[Speaker 14] (2:12:14 - 2:12:21)
So when we go in here, is it just completely ground floor parking? Oh, no.

[Speaker 11] (2:12:21 - 2:12:32)
So the left side of the screen, I think it's four ground floor residential units. But then the rear portion of the building is all garage parking.

[Speaker 14] (2:12:33 - 2:12:35)
So it's all interior parking. Correct.

[Speaker 11] (2:12:35 - 2:12:44)
Correct. And that actually is why that rear setback reduction at the first floor is necessary in order to capture the footprint of the first floor garage.

[Speaker 14] (2:12:45 - 2:12:47)
Okay, duly noted. Thank you, sir. Thank you, Chair.

[Speaker 1] (2:12:48 - 2:14:24)
Thank you. Any other questions? Hearing none, Alderperson Fuentes makes the motion to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed with a substitute narrative in place. Thank you.

For the record, Alderman Lopez has joined us. We are deferring the next two items. I will read them in and then we'll take a motion.

Oh, I'm sorry. All right. File number 22328 in the 45th ward.

Ordinance referred 12424. Common address 3955 North Kilpatrick at 3865 North Milwaukee Avenue. And then document number 22389-T1 in the first ward.

Ordinance referred 32024. Common address 2418 to 2426 North Milwaukee Avenue. If no questions by committee members, Alderwoman Dowell makes the motion to defer the previously read items by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, those items are deferred. All right.

Top of page four. Document number 22385-T1 in the 32nd ward. Ordinance referred 32024.

Common address is 1352 West Diversity Parkway. Change request. B22.

Neighborhood Mixed Use District to B22. Neighborhood Mixed Use District. And it's a type one with a variation included, which Sarah Barnes will tell us about.

[Speaker 13] (2:14:25 - 2:16:50)
Thank you. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and esteemed members of the committee. For the record, my name is Sarah Barnes and I'm a partner at the law office of Gozdecki Delgadote Americus Emprecado, LLP.

Happy to be here this afternoon on behalf of the applicant. Development Group LLC, Wrigley Branch. I do apologize.

I'm still getting over a little bit of laryngitis, which your predecessor would have appreciated because it's going to keep me very short winded. So with that, there are no substitutions there. That's the good news.

We actually did a type one zoning map amendment for this same property with this same applicant back in June 2023, getting it to the current zoning classification of a B22 that was met with unanimous support from the community group, the South Lake View Neighbors Association, as well as residents in the 32nd Ward and in the immediate area. Fast forward, went in for permitting, pursuant to the same set of plans that's before you here today, and certain additional relief was required for, believe it or not, the detached garage, which is just a standard three car garage. And because the community had been so involved in the type one process the first time around, we went ahead.

The alderman wanted us to keep it as that same type one. And with the new ordinance, we could come in and wrap up that variation that's required for just the detached garage. The building, which is a four-story, three-unit, all-residential condominium building, is actually completely compliant in all ways.

So we're just here today trying to clean up the relief that's required for the detached garage, and that's a variation to increase the floor area occupied by an accessory building. We did present this once more to the South Lake View Neighbors Association. They are in support.

You have a letter on record from South Lake View Neighbors, as well as Alderman Wagenstock. I'm happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (2:16:50 - 2:17:07)
Great. Thank you, Sarah. We do have a letter of support from the 32nd Ward.

Do we have any questions by committee members? Hearing none, Alderman Riley makes the motion due pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, the item is passed.

[Speaker 54] (2:17:08 - 2:17:11)
Thank you. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:17:18 - 2:17:41)
Middle of page four is document number 22355 from the 3rd Ward. Ordinance referred 21524. Common address is 4500 South Michigan Avenue.

Change request, B11, Neighborhood Shopping District to RM5, Residential Multi-Unit District. We have the owner of the property with JTM and Associates. Please state your name for the record.

[Speaker 53] (2:17:41 - 2:17:42)
Hi, my name is Marcus Perkins.

[Speaker 1] (2:17:43 - 2:17:44)
Thank you, Mr. Perkins. Please continue.

[Speaker 53] (2:17:45 - 2:18:11)
Yeah, I am the current owner of the property at 4500 South Michigan, commonly known as the Swift Mansion. We recently experienced a fire, so I'm seeking a zoning change to convert the building from its current use, current zoning from B1-1 to RM5 to accommodate eight dwelling units.

[Speaker 1] (2:18:12 - 2:18:17)
Great, and I know we have the support of the local Alderwoman. Alderwoman Dowd, do you want to add anything on that?

[Speaker 21] (2:18:18 - 2:18:42)
Yes, thank you. The Swift Mansion is an important asset in the Bronzeville community. Unfortunately, as Mr. Perkins says, it suffered a fire. He is changing the zoning in order to modernize the use of the building by bringing it back to residential use, and I support this and ask for the committee's support.

[Speaker 1] (2:18:44 - 2:19:37)
Great, thank you. Any questions by committee members? There's a question about outside parking.

How many parking spaces are there going to be on this site? Five. Five.

Great, yeah, which is on the agenda. Great. Any other questions?

Hearing none, all of the most spotter moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Best of luck to you and all the work. Good luck. Bottom of page four, document number 22379 in the 32nd ward, ordinance referred 32024.

Common address is 3015 to 3017 North Lincoln Avenue. Change request is B15, Neighborhood Shopping District, to B12, Neighborhood Shopping District. I'm here to present.

We have Warren Silver.

[Speaker 38] (2:19:38 - 2:21:13)
Morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. Warren Silver, Silver Law Office, PC for the record. Office is at 1700 West Irving Park Road in Chicago.

Here representing the owner and applicant TrimTab LLC. We are here because this applicant sought and secured a change in the zoning district from B12 to B15 back in 2021 for the purpose of doing a substantial rehab to an existing three-story building to convert it into a corporate headquarters for Human Capital Research Corporation, which is a consulting business that provides data-driven insights and strategy to executives in educational institutions, colleges, and universities.

And then above that office space would be a single dwelling unit for the owner of Human Capital. Uh, that project is complete. At the time to secure the support of the community and Alderman Wegespach for that zoning change, the applicant agreed to seek the return of the zoning district to the previously existing B12.

And that is what brings us here today. The project is complete. 35 jobs have moved into the 32nd ward.

And we're ready to fulfill our end of the bargain.

[Speaker 1] (2:21:14 - 2:21:27)
Thank you. Any questions by committee members? Hearing none.

Alderman Hopkins moves due pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Thank you, Mr. Silver. Thank you.

[Speaker 22] (2:21:29 - 2:21:32)
Excuse me, Mr. Chairman. Amir Rosa has his hand up.

[Speaker 1] (2:21:32 - 2:21:34)
Oh, my apologies.

[Speaker 54] (2:21:36 - 2:21:40)
Yes, I would like to recognize you as a panelist. Yes, thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:21:43 - 2:21:52)
We don't have a zone here. Alderman Amir Rosa, did you want to add something?

[Speaker 36] (2:21:56 - 2:22:01)
Thank you so much. Yes, I was just waiting to be recognized so I could be added to the quorum.

[Speaker 1] (2:22:02 - 2:22:05)
Thank you. We made the motion earlier, but welcome back.

[Speaker 54] (2:22:06 - 2:22:07)
Thanks.

[Speaker 1] (2:22:07 - 2:22:33)
Thank you. Great. Top of page 5 is document number 22381 in the 6th ward.

Ordinance referred 3-20-24. Common address, 6529-6533 South Stewart Avenue. Change request is an RT-4, residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to C-11, neighborhood commercial district.

We have Renee Hatcher.

[Speaker 55] (2:22:34 - 2:22:46)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman. My name is Renee Hatcher, attorney for the applicant, Grow Greater Inglewood, which is a locally based community organization that is driving this project. I'm happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (2:22:47 - 2:23:25)
Great. Any questions by committee members? Seeing none, all the women down moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, item is passed. Thank you very much, Ms. Hatcher. Next up, document number 22390-T1 in the 26th ward. Ordinance was referred 3-20-24. Common address, 1806 North Monticello Avenue.

Change request is RS-3, residential single unit district to RM-5, residential multi-unit district. We have Nick Fitikas.

[Speaker 11] (2:23:32 - 2:24:05)
Nick Fitikas from the offices of Sandbanks. I'm here on behalf of the applicant and property owner, William Aquino. The first case is 1806 North Monticello.

This is an existing four-unit building that we're proposing to establish a garden unit in, so a total of five units. This is a type one change. However, there were no changes to the plans or narrative.

And we don't believe any additional zoning relief would be required. We did the client work directly with Alderman Fuentes on this application, and we believe we have the alderman's support to proceed.

[Speaker 1] (2:24:06 - 2:24:09)
All right, we have a letter from the other person, but she is with us. Yes.

[Speaker 45] (2:24:15 - 2:24:40)
Thank you, Chair. Mr. Aquino has been a resident in our ward for over 30 years. Back used to work for streets and sanitation, and has always been one to contribute to the need.

There is a second item that Nick will be reading, but these are to continue to build and develop naturally occurring affordable housing. So we're excited about the possibilities here at Monticello.

[Speaker 1] (2:24:42 - 2:24:47)
Excellent. Is this something that would be accomplished with the citywide ADU ordinance, or are you in the pilot area?

[Speaker 45] (2:24:48 - 2:24:52)
It is not in the pilot area. It's why the zoning change is required.

[Speaker 1] (2:24:52 - 2:25:33)
I wanted to point that out since Alderman LaSpota had not. I went down on the job, man. Come on.

All right, we'll keep it moving then. Any other questions by committee members? Hearing none, although LaSpota moves due pass by the same roll call that was used to determine the quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed. I'll read the second item.

I know you've already spoken. If you will just take it then. Document number 22391-T1 of the 26th Ward.

Ordinance referred 320-24. Common address 1800-1804 North Monticello Avenue. Change request.

RS3 residential single unit district to RM4.5 residential multi-unit district. Nick Petekas?

[Speaker 11] (2:25:33 - 2:25:47)
Yes, sir. So the only difference is either the two neighboring lots that are currently vacant. Each would be developed with a three-story, three-unit residential building.

Again, it went through the review process with the Alderman's office, and we believe we have the Alderman's support to proceed.

[Speaker 1] (2:25:48 - 2:25:50)
All right, all the person in front of us. Anything else to add?

[Speaker 45] (2:25:51 - 2:26:20)
Just that we love building three flats on vacant lots. And I also want to mention that this is a part of the 26th Ward that is rapidly being gentrified since the development of the 606 Trail. What we have found in this part of the ward is demolitions and deconversions, taking away opportunities to house multi-generational families.

And so to be able to bring more three flats into the ward is exactly what our families need.

[Speaker 1] (2:26:20 - 2:27:16)
Excellent, excellent. Any other questions by committee members? Seeing none, Alderman Riley moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, item is passed. Thank you.

All right, I'm going to read the next two together. Document number 22391-T1 in the 10th Ward, ordinance referred 32024. Common address is 8707-09 South Houston Avenue.

Change request is an RS3 residential single unit district to an RM4.5 residential multi-unit district. The second item we'll take together is document number 22393-T1 in the 10th Ward, ordinance referred 32024. Common address is 8719 South Houston Avenue.

Change request is an RS3 residential single unit district to an RM4.5 residential multi-unit district. Nick Fitikas.

[Speaker 11] (2:27:16 - 2:27:50)
Chairman, again for the record, Nick Fitikas, Law Offices of Sandbanks. I'm here with the applicant and property owner, Crystal Hammond. She owns all three of these lots.

All three lots are currently vacant. The plan is to develop each of the lots with a new three-story, four-unit residential building. These are type one zoning change applications because we are seeking an adjustment to reduce the one-to-one parking to three parking spaces for each building.

We did work with Alderman Chico's office, and we have a letter of support on file, and I'd be happy to answer any questions you or your committee members have.

[Speaker 1] (2:27:51 - 2:28:33)
Thank you. We do have the letter from Alderman Chico. Any questions by committee members?

Hearing none, Alderman Hopkins moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, these two items are passed.

Thank you. Thank you. All right, going to the middle of seven.

Document number 22388 in the 11th Ward. Ordinance referred 3-20-24. Common address is 2845, sorry, 2847, excuse me, to 53 South Hillcock Avenue.

Change requests. It's an RS3, residential, single-unit district to RT4, residential, two-flat townhouse, and multi-unit district. We have Attorney Gordon Pekarsky.

[Speaker 34] (2:28:34 - 2:29:05)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. I'm Tom Pekarsky of the Law Firm of Gordon and Pekarsky on behalf of the applicant, Jeff Ingen. Before I begin my case in chief, there have been additions to the original application subsequent to the time of filing.

We recognize a slight northside setback variation would be necessary to develop as proposed. We have amended the application to be a Type 1 and submitted a narrative and plans, and I would ask that all legislation reflect that change.

[Speaker 1] (2:29:06 - 2:29:16)
Thank you. Oliver Dowell moves to amend the application to a Type 1 by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, the item is amended to a Type 1 application.

[Speaker 34] (2:29:16 - 2:30:24)
Thank you. We're before you seeking a Type 1 amendment of the City of Chicago zoning map from the current RS3 to that of an RT4 for the property commonly known as 2847 through 53 South Hillock Avenue. The subject is 68.7 feet wide and is improved with a single-family home on a vacant side lot. The applicant seeks to subdivide the property into two lots. The resulting lot, commonly known as 2847 Hillock, will be 37.7 feet wide and maintain the existing single-family home. The resulting lot, commonly known as 2853 Hillock, will be 30.76 feet wide and be improved with a new three-unit residential building. We have reviewed our plans with Alderman Lee and appeared before an extensive community process on this. No objections have been voiced to the proposal, and Alderman Lee has issued her support in the form of a letter previously offered to the Chair. Therefore, we would ask the committee to vote its recommendation of passage of the application to the full City Council.

[Speaker 1] (2:30:25 - 2:31:11)
Thank you, Mr. Piekarski. We do have the support letter from Alderman Lee. Any questions by committee members?

Seeing none, all the persons who went to us move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine forum. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Thank you. As a Type 1. Passed as a Type 1.

Thank you. Bottom of 7 is document number 22384-T1 in the 32nd Ward. Ordinance referred 3-20-24.

Common address is 3015-3017 North Southport Avenue. Change request, B-3-2, Neighborhood Mixed-Use District to B—I'm sorry. From B-2-3, Neighborhood Mixed-Use District to B-2-3, Neighborhood Mixed-Use District.

Here to present is Tyler Manning.

[Speaker 4] (2:31:11 - 2:31:27)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Tyler Manning. I'm an attorney with Shane Banks, Kenyon Shorts.

As an initial matter, we do have the substitute Type 1 narrative and plans that we'd like incorporated in the record.

[Speaker 1] (2:31:28 - 2:31:39)
Thank you. Alderman LaSpada moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the Type 1 application for the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, the substitute narrative and plans are accepted.

[Speaker 4] (2:31:40 - 2:32:57)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Back in 2017, City Council approved the Zoning Map Amendment to rezone this parcel to a B-2-3. In 2020, the ZBA also approved variations for this project pursuant to the Type 1 plans.

However, due to COVID and some complications that arose from that, the owner was unable to complete the permitting and the Type 1 expired. This application is simply seeking to reinstate that Type 1 Zoning Map Amendment from 2017 to allow for the construction of a five-story, seven-dwelling unit residential building. Similar to the 2020 ZBA proceedings, this application also incorporates the relief approved by the ZBA to reduce the front north side and rear setbacks and increase the height.

Also, due to the new ETOD ordinance, we have to seek the new relief of having one-to-one parking here, so we're seeking an administrative adjustment also to have seven parking spaces for the seven-dwelling units. Alderman Wagesbeck has provided this committee with a letter regarding this project, and as a result, I respectfully request this committee's favorable recommendation for this Zoning Map Amendment, and I'll be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (2:32:58 - 2:33:00)
Thank you, Mr. Bannack. Alderman Hopkins.

[Speaker 43] (2:33:03 - 2:33:32)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. On a due past motion on this item, it's not in my order, but I happen to live pretty close to this, and I'm familiar with this lot and this building. But as a brief sidebar, Mr. Chairman, I just want to commend you and the Zoning Committee staff for the new format for organizing the documents with the color coding, etc., makes it so much easier to read and follow along. It's a great idea, and I really appreciate that you guys did that. And I'll put a due past motion on this item. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:33:32 - 2:33:32)
Great.

[Speaker 43] (2:33:33 - 2:33:33)
Alderman Vespada.

[Speaker 14] (2:33:36 - 2:34:02)
Number one, I'll second Alderman Hopkins' point, and I do really appreciate how many developers and attorneys have been bringing renderings before the committee today. It makes it much easier to understand and reflect on what we're actually voting for. That said, I just wanted to ask, are we building onto the facade of an existing building?

I'm trying to make sense of the design, Tony.

[Speaker 4] (2:34:03 - 2:34:29)
It's just a surface parking lot right now. So this project in 2017 went through extensive design with the community. And the reason why there's kind of a contrast in style is a building that you can see a corridor of directly north of it.

We're just trying to tie in features from that building into this design.

[Speaker 14] (2:34:31 - 2:34:39)
Okay. You know, it went through the community process. So community process is community process.

Thank you. Thank you, Chair.

[Speaker 1] (2:34:41 - 2:35:37)
Thank you. It does have a unique look, I think maybe is what we're asking about. And my ward is a couple blocks from here, too, so I know the stretch pretty well on my end.

Any other questions by community members? Hearing none, Alderman Hopkins made the motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, the item is passed. With substitute narrative and plans. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Top of page eight. Document number 228, I'm sorry, document number 22382 in the 25th ward. Ordinance referred 32024.

Common address is 2286 South Blue Line. 2286 South Blue Island Avenue. Change request.

C12 commercial neighborhood commercial district to B23 neighborhood mixed use district. We have Tyler Manick.

[Speaker 4] (2:35:37 - 2:36:45)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Tyler Manick. I'm attorney of Shane Banks, Kenny and Schwartz.

I'm the attorney for the owner of the property at 2286 Blue Island Avenue. The property is currently improved with a three-story masonry building containing five dwelling units and a vacant storefront that was last used as a food distributor back in 2011 and has been vacant since. This project is fairly straightforward.

We're just trying to reactivate this commercial space with an accessible dwelling unit. And to do so, we're seeking to rezone this property from a C12 neighborhood commercial district to the B23 neighborhood mixed use district in order to activate that commercial space with a dwelling unit. The applicant has met with Alderman Cicico-Lopez and a zoning advisory board who each supported this effort to activate this long-term vacancy.

And I believe this committee has a letter of support to this effect. And as a result, I respectfully request this committee's favorable recommendation on this zoning map amendment application. I'm happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (2:36:46 - 2:37:25)
Thank you. We do have a letter of support from Alderman Cicico-Lopez. Any questions by committee members?

Hearing none, Alderman McDowell moves due pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, this item is passed.

Last item for you. One more. Document number 22383-T1 in the 16th Ward.

Ordinance referred. 32024. Common address is 1946-48 West 63rd Street.

Change requests. RS3, residential single unit district to C21, motor vehicle related commercial district. For the last time today, Tyler Manick.

[Speaker 4] (2:37:25 - 2:38:01)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. Again, for the record, my name is Tyler Manick. I'm the attorney for the applicant Ray Noso in installation who owns a property at 1944 West 63rd Street, which is improved with a single story commercial building where the applicant operates it.

It's installation company. The applicant is in the process of purchasing the unimproved parcel to add accessory parking for their use. And I should mention as a threshold matter, we do have a substitute type one narrative.

[Speaker 1] (2:38:02 - 2:38:13)
Yes, Alderman Rodley moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine form. Any objections? Hearing none, the substitute narrative and plans are accepted.

[Speaker 4] (2:38:14 - 2:39:10)
So the lot containing their current business is zone C21. However, the next door lot which they want to use accessory parking is RS3. So we're looking to make a unified zoning district of C21 in order to allow accessory parking for their business.

This vacant lot also has an existing eight foot privacy fence along its perimeter that the applicant intends to preserve for security and screening. To do so, the applicant seeks administrative adjustments to reduce the landscape screening requirements as well as the front and side setbacks. The applicant has met with Alderman Coleman about this project and she kindly gave a letter of support that was shared with this committee.

As a result, I respectfully request this committee's favorable recommendation for this zoning map amendment application. I'd be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (2:39:11 - 2:39:57)
Thank you. We do have the letter from Alderman Coleman. Any questions by committee members?

Seeing none, Alderman Espada moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed as substitute narrative and plans.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Bottom of page eight. Document number 22392-T1 in the 39th Ward.

Ordinance was referred 32024. Common address is 3244 through 50 West Bryn Mawr Avenue. Change requests.

This is B23 Neighborhood Mixed-Use District to B23 Neighborhood Mixed-Use District with an adjustment or two in a variation. We have Rolando Acosta.

[Speaker 5] (2:39:57 - 2:40:10)
Through Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, for the record, Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant. We do have a substitute narrative for this project, so I would ask that that request be amended to include it.

[Speaker 1] (2:40:10 - 2:40:21)
Yes, Alderman Hopkins moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the substitute narrative and plans are accepted.

[Speaker 5] (2:40:21 - 2:42:41)
The subject properly is located mid-block on Bryn Mawr Avenue, just west of Kedzie. You can see it on the screen. It actually has an orange-rated significant facade.

Back in 2019-2020, we went through a community process that resulted in this proposal, which is to retain the facade and build behind it a four-story building that will contain 30 dwelling units, 30 parking spaces. The subsequent to that, we went to the Zoning Board of Appeals to secure variations for loading relief, as well as, excuse me, rear yard setback that was necessitated because of the fact that we are retaining the front facade, constraining the available construction on the site. Unfortunately, due to COVID and economic conditions, the applicant had filed for a building permit, building permit lapsed, hence the building permit application was voided.

That voided the variation request. The rezoning stayed in effect because it was not a type one rezoning, but the variation was voided. We filed this rezoning after Alderwoman Nugent gathered myself, Zoning Administrator Patrick Murphy, Hal Hutchinson from the Building Department, because now the developer does have the funds to go forward.

The community very much wants this to go forward. So we needed to expedite the process. The most expeditious way to secure the variations, again, was to secure this type one rezoning.

The specific variations that are being requested are three. One is to reduce the rear yard setback from 30 feet on the residential floors to 10 feet, to remove the requirement for one loading berth, which enabled us to provide the one to one parking the community requested, to allow us to increase the height from 65 feet to 66 feet. So by one foot, and there was a fourth one when it was filed, but it was deleted.

That was the reason for, among the reasons for the substitute narrative in that initially it was requested that we be able to increase the parking to one to one, but actually that limitation does not apply to this property because we are transit served, but we're only transit served by buses and not a train station. With that, I believe Alderwoman Nugent has communicated its support to the committee, and I'm happy to answer any questions the committee may have.

[Speaker 1] (2:42:41 - 2:42:50)
Thank you. We do have a letter of support from Alderwoman Nugent. You mentioned this building, I'll have a few, is 66 feet in height.

How many stories is it?

[Speaker 5] (2:42:52 - 2:42:59)
It's four stories, but I think because where they're measuring it to the top of the penthouse is the reason for that. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:42:59 - 2:43:01)
And I know you've got a tall first floor here.

[Speaker 5] (2:43:01 - 2:43:07)
We have a tall, we do have a tall first floor because we're trying to match the existing windows on the existing first floor.

[Speaker 1] (2:43:07 - 2:43:08)
You've got a lot of tall floors though.

[Speaker 5] (2:43:09 - 2:43:09)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (2:43:10 - 2:43:12)
What was the original use of the building?

[Speaker 5] (2:43:12 - 2:43:35)
Well, so the building, I happen to live two blocks from here, so the community calls the Alderwoman first and then calls me second to find out why this is not done yet. So I very much would like this to happen. This has been vacant for 15 years.

Prior to that, I think it was a series of stores. I don't believe there were any restaurants in this building, but it has been boarded up for at least a decade. Gotcha.

[Speaker 1] (2:43:36 - 2:43:42)
Well, it's very distinctive looking. So I appreciate the investment to bring that back. And maybe the neighbors will leave you alone a little bit.

[Speaker 5] (2:43:42 - 2:43:44)
Once it gets done, they will. Yes.

[Speaker 1] (2:43:44 - 2:43:48)
That's another project. Any other questions by committee members? Alderman Spada.

[Speaker 14] (2:43:49 - 2:44:01)
Okay. Thank you very much. Yeah.

I'm just curious, do we have other angles on this? I feel like I've gone to breakfast. There used to be a breakfast place.

[Speaker 5] (2:44:01 - 2:44:37)
So you've gone to breakfast just west of here at the Bryn Mawr Breakfast Club? No. Which is about a block and a half west of this location.

Once you pass Midori, the good sushi restaurant on the block. There we go. There we go.

But so this has been vacant, Alderman, for at least 15 years. And it is adjacent to, so immediately to the west, there is a building with a similar facade as to the one that exists today, but that is sort of dormant. And it's only one single facade.

It's not a longer stretch. And to the east is a nondescript tailor shop.

[Speaker 14] (2:44:38 - 2:44:42)
How far set back is the addition from the...

[Speaker 5] (2:44:43 - 2:44:48)
I believe it's set back at least five feet. It was worked out with the Landmarks Division of the Department of Planning.

[Speaker 14] (2:44:49 - 2:44:52)
And we're not doing any new curve cuts. We're accessing the...

[Speaker 5] (2:44:52 - 2:44:54)
Everything is accessed from the rear, from the alley.

[Speaker 14] (2:44:54 - 2:44:57)
Okay. Fascinating. Cool.

Thank you so much. Great.

[Speaker 1] (2:44:58 - 2:45:16)
Thank you. And Nicole just sent the full set of plans to you as well. So you can do a deep dive.

Any other questions by committee members? Hearing none, Vice Mayor Burnett moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, the item is passed as substitute and revised.

[Speaker 5] (2:45:17 - 2:45:17)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:45:18 - 2:45:42)
Thank you. All right. Page nine at the top, document number 22387-T1 in the 27th Ward.

Ordinance referred on 3-20-24. Common address, 1157 West Grand Avenue. Change request, M22, Light Industry District to B22, Neighborhood Mixed Use District.

And we have Attorney Barry Ashe.

[Speaker 46] (2:45:42 - 2:46:47)
Good afternoon, Chairman, members of the board. For the record, my name is Barry Ashe. I'm an attorney with the law firm of Ashe, Annos, Friedman & Logan.

I'm here representing KFT Realty, LLC. In its request for a rezoning from the B2-2 to the M2-2. This is a type one rezoning, but we have no change in the plans or narrative.

Relating to this property, it is improved with a two-story mixed-use masonry building. The first floor contains an existing commercial use. And above the commercial use is an existing residential, single residential unit.

The purpose of the rezoning is simply to permit the owner of the property to explore a timeshare which would not be permitted in the manufacturing district. So they went before the neighborhood group. The neighbors of River West made a presentation before them, which I believe you have an approval letter from them.

And this property is in Alderman Burnett's Ward. And there was discussion with the applicant with the alderman relating to his support.

[Speaker 1] (2:46:48 - 2:46:53)
Thank you, Mr. Ashe. We do have a letter from the neighbors, and we do have the vice mayor here to speak on this item.

[Speaker 10] (2:46:54 - 2:47:10)
Thank you, Mr. President. So this is a, he's just using the first floor, not changing the building. He had a community meeting.

The community organization is in support of it. We're in support of it. We ask for the committee's support.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:47:10 - 2:47:53)
Thank you. Any questions by committee members? Hearing none.

Alderman McDowell moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Great. Thank you. Our last item of the day.

Per usual, document number 22386-T1, 27th Ward. Ordinance referred 32024. Common address is 455 North Carpenter.

Change request is M22, Light Industry District to B35, Community Shopping District with an adjustment and variation. We have Attorney Katie Jenke-Dale.

[Speaker 49] (2:47:53 - 2:47:57)
Thank you. I'm meaning to talk to you about last per usual.

[Speaker 1] (2:47:58 - 2:48:01)
You're always last. You've always got the last P.D. of the day. Sorry, Katie.

[Speaker 49] (2:48:03 - 2:48:55)
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Katie Jenke-Dale from the law firm of DLA Piper. We represent the applicant Range 455 Owner LLC, which is an S.P.E. controlled by Range Group. I'm joined today by Brett Katz and his partners with Range. The site's located at the southeast corner of Carpenter and Grand. The proposed redevelopment would allow for the construction of the five-story building, the 72 residential units above ground floor commercial shown on the screen.

As you mentioned, the applicant is also seeking approval of relief for parking to reduce it to a 0.4 parking ratio and a rear yard setback reduction to 12 feet instead of 30. As always, the project engaged in a very robust community engagement process led by Alderman Burnett and the neighbors of River West. And I see the Alderman is here today, but we're available for any questions.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:48:55 - 2:48:57)
Thank you. Vice Mayor Burnett.

[Speaker 10] (2:48:58 - 2:49:47)
Yeah, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. And I'm like Katie Jenke-Dale. This last stuff is something else for me, too.

But anyway, it's all good. So, you know, one, we're inspired to see young developers come to the table who have worked for larger developers and, you know, and go out and do their own thing. So we're inspired by that.

They did go to our local community organization, Neighbors of the West Loop. They had a community meeting. No one had any complaints, any and everything that they wanted to be adjusted.

They did. So they supported, we supported, we asked for the committee support.

[Speaker 1] (2:49:47 - 2:50:22)
Thank you, Vice Mayor. Any questions by committee members? Hearing none, Alderman Riley moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed. Congratulations.

Sharp, sharp building. As long as you have the most PDs in the city, you're going to be on the last end of the agenda. Let's see if somebody gives you a run for their money.

There being no further business before the committee, Alderman McDowell makes a motion to adjourn. Any objections? Hearing none, we are adjourned.

Thank you.
