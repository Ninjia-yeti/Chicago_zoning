[Speaker 12] (11:44 - 11:51)
Yes, my name is Carlos Ramirez Rosa, and I am your chair for the Committee on Zoning Landmarks and Building Standards.

[Speaker 1] (11:52 - 17:12)
It is 10.10 a.m. on June 20, 2023, and this meeting of the committee is called to order. So we will start off with the roll call. Committee members, please note that your yes or present response will be deemed to be a yes vote when this quorum roll call is used as a reference vote for later items.

All right. Thank you, committee members.

We have a quorum. Alderman Hopkins has requested to attend the meeting by remote means under the provisions of Rule 49 because he cannot be physically present due to a family emergency. Is there any objection to this request?

Hearing no objection, Alderman Hopkins is allowed to attend this meeting by remote means. Welcome, Alderman Hopkins. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. All right. So before we proceed with our agenda, I would just like to take a moment to introduce you to our Zoning Committee staff. Continuing on with the Zoning Committee in her 21st year, 20th year with the Zoning Committee, we have Nicole Wellhausen.

Joining the Zoning Committee is Jessica Vasquez. If you would please stand. As well as Charles Chassieridge.

So committee members, these folks are here to serve you. And then we also have Denise. Where's Denise?

You can bother her about zoning matters until June 30th. All right. So we will now move on to the approval of the Rule 45 reports containing the minutes of the April and May hearings of the Committee on Zoning, Landmark, and Building Standards.

All members of this committee should have received an electronic copy as well as a copy in your packet. If hearing no objection, do I have a motion by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum to approve the minutes? Alderman Mosley makes a motion.

If no questions by committee members, Vice Chair Lawson makes a motion to defer the previously listed items by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Are there any objections? Hearing no objections, the items have been deferred.

At this time, we will begin the public comment period. We have three public commenters, and you are reminded that public comment will be limited to 30 minutes. Out of respect for everyone's time, each speaker is limited to three minutes.

We have three public speakers sign up for today's hearing, and we will hear from them now.

[Speaker 12] (17:12 - 17:35)
First up, we have Mr. Max Chavez, who will be representing Preservation Chicago. Good morning. My name is Max Chavez.

I am Director of Research and Special Projects at Preservation Chicago.

[Speaker 18] (17:36 - 20:05)
Last fall, we were made aware of the listing of 206 South Jefferson for sale. The former industrial building was first built in the early part of the 1900s, but it truly became a major part of Chicago music history in 1977, when it was opened by Robert Williams as The Warehouse, a late-night dance club popular with Chicago's queer communities of color. It was at this club, with the iconic DJ Frankie Knuckles at the helm, that house music was developed.

From The Warehouse, this new sound spread to Chicago living rooms, to the rest of the world. This landscape of world music, because of The Warehouse, because of Frankie Knuckles, and because of Chicago, was changed forever. The sale listing offered that the building could be redeveloped, but we knew that the rubble pile was no acceptable fate for the birthplace of house, so we turned to Chicago Winds for help.

We announced the building as one of our seven most endangered sites in Chicago, and created a Change.org petition, asking the public to show their support for the landmarking of The Warehouse. The result was astonishing, and it soon stretched just beyond the Chicago city limits. We had nearly 15,000 signatures in just a few weeks, hundreds of letters of support submitted, and dozens of articles published in news outlets, both local and international.

The potential of losing The Warehouse captured the attention of music lovers around the world, and in a stirring show of love and respect for the birthplace of house, the public helped us demonstrate just why this place matters so much. The rest is history, and so here we are today, hoping to push this effort across the finish line and make The Warehouse Chicago's newest official landmark. Landmarking The Warehouse accomplishes so much more than just retaining the brick and mortar of this place as a tangible monument to the history that it contains.

Landmarking The Warehouse declares that Chicago is one of the great music cities of the world, and that without House and Frankie Knuckles, the music that we've enjoyed for the past four decades would sound so different and would lack the distinct bliss and joy that only House brings to the dance floor. It would affirm the place of queer, black, and brown people in our city's history, communities that have for too long gone uncelebrated by our city's landmarks, and that this landmarking may very well come poignantly during Pride Month at a time when the queer community faces an ever-increasing barrage of dangerous rhetoric as not gone unnoticed by me. So what better way to commemorate queer Chicagoans than by landmarking The Warehouse, a place of dancefloor rapture in the face of ongoing marginalization?

There is no greater honor for our city's buildings than landmark status, and it's something that we bestow only on the most deserving and sometimes the most mammoth places in our city's heritage. And The Warehouse is all of these things. It's an incredible place of importance and the birthplace of a sound, a movement, and a community.

So as a way to recognize this, only landmarking status could suffice. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (20:07 - 20:15)
Thank you so much, Mr. Chavez. Next up, we have Mr. Frederick Dunson from the Frankie Knuckles Foundation.

[Speaker 12] (20:18 - 20:26)
Good morning. I'm going to echo some of the same sentiments that Max did in his statement regarding The Warehouse.

[Speaker 23] (20:29 - 22:23)
It is my hope that this designation becomes a reality. Our great city, so rich in culture, should recognize all of its brilliance and status and diversity, and it has on countless levels. Preservation of our unique contributions in art, diverse cultures, architecture, history, and all the combined essences that make Chicago so great can meet the mark of preserving our musical culture as well.

The blues, jazz, gospel, and house music are all rooted in the rich fabric of our city. The Warehouse is where the culture of house and now the genre of house music was cultivated and where house music got its name. This space, this place, offered a haven to our diverse LGBTQ plus community and anyone who sought the joy of music.

It was the place of freedom and release for thousands of people over its years and birthed the musical genre recognized all over the world. When the world rejoices in house music, it looks to Chicago for its history. When cultures want to find out more about the roots of house music, it comes to Chicago for our story.

The world honors Chicago as the birthplace of this unique and thriving music and culture. Chicago would do a great disservice to itself by not honoring the building and the legacy as well. Although our city has many different designations as a reminder of the house music community and the importance of our culture, such as honorary street signs and special day designations for the founders, we do not have a building, a space, a place that can give the starting point of its origins.

206 South Jefferson is that place. It is ours. It is rich and deserves to be designated and preserved as such.

The history of house music, the culture, the community that so well and loved and cherished Chicago should have a destination where people can see where it all began.

[Speaker 12] (22:23 - 22:38)
And what better way to celebrate pride, Ma? Thank you. Thank you so much, Mr. Dunson. Next up, we have Phil Bresnahan from Farnell Fabricating.

[Speaker 30] (22:42 - 23:53)
Good morning. I represent the business owners that are on the streets on Columbus Avenue. We're a small group of small business owners just trying to get some insight of what different changes and rezoning and how it really applies to us.

Trying to do research or just trying to get information because we want to make sure we're protecting our buildings and doing the right things, keeping things up to the proper code. But we've been finding a lot more challenges of trying to understand those codes and where to find it. For my own personal building, being categorized to a commercial, to a light industrial, some things are very general, which that I understand.

I'm going to learn that process. But as I do more research through the Department of Buildings and Zoning, and even through the Alderman Mom, I see a lot of things that haven't been really updated. And it kind of makes a lot of our small business owners kind of disappointed.

We're trying to find some guidance. We're trying to find some leadership. And for me, I'm down here just to provide those business owners, myself, that sole leadership that we want to help our community, we want to be part of it, but we also need a little bit more better guidance from you all so we can do the best for our city.

[Speaker 1] (23:55 - 25:08)
Thank you so much, Mr. Bresnahan. If you could connect with my staff there in the chamber, we'll make sure to get your contact information and we'll make sure to connect you with your Alderman and with the Zoning Administrator. Thank you so much.

All right, that ends our public comment section, and we will now move on with the addendum to the agenda. First item on the addendum is document number A-2023-47, the appointment of Mayor Brandon Johnson as a member of the Public Building Commission, replacing former Mayor Lori Lightfoot. If there are no questions by committee members, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

Alderman LaSpada moves do pass. Any objections? Hearing none, the appointment is passed.

Moving on to historical landmark designations. First up is document number O-2023-2000 in the 48th Ward for the Epworth Church located at 5253 North Kenmore Avenue. We have Mr. Matt Crawford of the Historic Preservation Division of the Department of Planning and Development here to present this matter. Mr. Crawford.

[Speaker 6] (25:09 - 25:35)
Thank you, Chairman. Again, Matt Crawford for the record. I'm a historian with the Department of Planning and Development, and I also serve on staff to the Commission on Chicago Landmarks, and that body is recommending the council landmark designation of this building, Epworth Church.

Epworth consists of the church building from 1891, left in the slide, and the community house addition from 1930, at the right.

[Speaker 12] (25:36 - 25:49)
It's located at Berwyn and Kenmore Avenues in Edgewater. The Commission found that this building is unique in Chicago.

[Speaker 6] (25:50 - 26:41)
It's a rare example of what's called fieldstone architecture that employs uncoursed granite boulders that were brought to the site from Wisconsin by barge. Epworth also tells us a little bit about how the city developed. Edgewater initially was a suburban development, and this building kind of reflects that architectural character of the initial development of the neighborhood, which later became quite dense.

And like many houses of worship in Chicago, it reminds us the important role that institutions play in the social fabric of our neighborhoods and how they develop. The building is located in the 34th Ward. Alderwoman Mana Hoppenworth has written a letter of support for this landmark designation, so I'm happy to answer any questions you might have.

[Speaker 1] (26:42 - 26:59)
Thank you so much, Mr. Crawford. As noted, we do have the support of Alderwoman Mana Hoppenworth on this item. Are there any questions by committee members?

All right, hearing no questions. Oh, we have one question here. Mr. Lawson, Alderman Lawson.

[Speaker 34] (26:59 - 27:12)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Hi, Matt. I was just going to ask, is there a user, or what's the plan for the church?

I used to live around the corner. It's really kind of a remarkable building, but I know, you know, going forward— Good question.

[Speaker 6] (27:12 - 27:42)
Thanks, Alderman. The building is still owned by the Methodist denomination, and part of that denomination helps congregations transition or sell buildings, and that's the organization that's trying to find a new use for this building. So the Methodists right now are seeking to convert the building to some kind of affordable housing.

It's a long path, but that's part of the Methodist, you know, social teaching that they want to express in the building.

[Speaker 12] (27:44 - 27:44)
Wonderful.

[Speaker 1] (27:44 - 28:41)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Any other questions from committee members? All right.

Seeing no other questions, Alderwoman Dowell renews her motion to pass this item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. So Alderwoman Dowell moves to pass. Are there any objections?

Hearing none, the designation is passed. Moving on, we have the direct introduction of the historical landmark designation for the Warehouse, located at 206 South Jefferson in the 34th Ward. Committee members should have received an electronic copy of this item on Thursday, as well as have a copy in the packet before you.

Vice Chair Lawson makes a motion to accept the direct introduction by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Are there any objections? Hearing none, the direct introduction is before us.

Once again, we have Mr. Crawford of the Historic Preservation Division of the Department of Planning and Development here to present this matter. Mr. Crawford.

[Speaker 6] (28:41 - 29:01)
Thanks, Chairman. Again, the Commission on Chicago Landmarks has recommended to Council that the Warehouse building be designated as a Chicago landmark. And I will attempt to add a little bit to the testimony you've already heard, but these two gentlemen, Mr. Chavez and Mr. Dunstan, have said it all and said it very well.

[Speaker 12] (29:01 - 29:14)
The building is located in the West Loop at Jefferson and Adams.

[Speaker 6] (29:20 - 31:02)
And the significance of the building is from here, beginning in 1977 up to the mid-80s, this was the birthplace of house music in Chicago, led by the resident DJ Frankie Knuckles. House is a genre of dance music characterized by a driving beat, emotive lyrics, and lush orchestration. And Frankie Knuckles did this by combining different genres of music, including disco, R&B, and gospel.

The Warehouse is also very significant to Chicago's LGBTQ, Black, and Latino communities who first embraced house music here and who found a sense of community in the Warehouse's revolutionary music and sound and scene. Well, anyways, the Warehouse is also significant, as I said, for its association with Frankie Knuckles, influential American DJ, record producer, and remix artist who significantly contributes to the music of the United States and the world. He's known as the godfather of house music.

Can't really overestimate the importance of the Warehouse building. We, as Max Chavez said, we've heard support from across the globe. And this building and its effort to landmark it has been covered in press in Europe and across the United States.

So it's really important. The building is located in the 34th Ward. Alderman Conway has written a letter of support.

I'm happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (31:04 - 31:12)
Thank you so much, Mr. Crawford. And as noted, Alderman Conway is in support. And I know you'd like to offer some words.

[Speaker 25] (31:12 - 32:30)
Yes, sir. Mr. Chairman, this is a momentous day to bestow landmark status upon the Warehouse at 206 South Jefferson. We celebrate the building's history as a safe space for LGBTQ plus Chicagoans here during Pride Month, as the birth of house music and on behalf of Frankie Knuckles, the godfather of house music.

You know, this effort really began with the introduction of Frankie Knuckles Way in 2004 by then state Senator Barack Obama, who subsequently went on to make a little something of himself. Tough room anyway. But I'd also like to thank Alan King and Frederick Dunson, who you heard from earlier today.

The Frankie Knuckles Foundation have been pushing for proper recognition for years for this for this building. Also Preservation Chicago and Max Chavez, who you also heard from earlier today. And the petition they circulated, which has been signed by over 14,000 people as of this morning.

And also yourself, Chairman Ramirez Rosa, for pushing this as a direct introduction so we can get it done during during Pride Month. So I'm very, very proud to have this as a landmark in the 34th Ward. And thank you all for your for your tireless support to make it happen.

Thank you, sir.

[Speaker 2] (32:30 - 34:19)
Thank you. Alderman Burnett. Thank you.

Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I'll be remiss if I did not say anything about the warehouse of Frankie Knuckles. Of course, that was around my age group when when when the warehouse first opened up.

And just so you know, it wasn't just LGBTQ people going to the warehouse. It was everybody. We all partied there.

It was a place where everyone felt safe. It was a place where everyone felt that they weren't discriminated against. Being a young man from Cabrini Green, hanging out with guys who worked in corporate America and women who worked in corporate America and just partying and having a good time is just was a great place.

It made everyone feel good. And those parties lasted for a long time. I have the benefit of being there when they named the street after Frankie Knuckles.

Of course, everyone thought it was my ward for which at that time it was the second ward. But I took it anyway, you know, and I was happy to be able to name the street because Frankie Knuckles not only was someone who I admired a lot, but he was also a good friend. We love that guy.

He just was a genuine, charitable, good person here in the city of Chicago and is well deserved that we named the street after him. He's loved all over the world. You go all over the world.

You hear Frankie Knuckles music being played in every country. So I'm in full support of this landmark. And I thank the Alderman and Landmark for allowing this to happen.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (34:20 - 34:23)
Are there any other questions or testimony from members?

[Speaker 13] (34:24 - 34:43)
Thank you, Chairman. Just two quick questions. I'm just curious how the building currently functions, who occupies it, and maybe even more of a matter of public education.

What are the protections and or opportunities afforded by landmark status here in Chicago?

[Speaker 6] (34:44 - 36:27)
Thanks, Alderman. Yes, the landmark designation of this building would apply to its exterior. So essentially the facade and roof line of the building would be protected, windows and doors.

And the protection would mean that any changes that the owner would propose would need to comply with the preservation standards. The building was recently purchased by a law firm, a small law firm, and they intend to locate their offices in the building. It would be just the one firm.

It's currently law offices. The warehouse lasted from 1977 to 1982 at the building. And I think after 82, it kind of converted to office use.

In a way, it was such a successful venue that the building was just too small to house the number of people that were attending the club. In terms of benefits of landmarking, too, that the owner might be able to take advantage of would be a permit fee waiver for when they're doing their conversion and build out. I think they will apply for that.

There is also the Adopt-a-Landmark Fund that is rolled out annually that they can apply for a grant to do work. Those are the main benefits aside from just the recognition of the building. And the owners have consented to this landmark designation.

They didn't realize when they bought the building what they had, the cultural significance of what they had acquired. But I think during the landmark designation process, that became very clear to them.

[Speaker 13] (36:29 - 36:31)
Appreciate the context. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (36:31 - 38:23)
Thank you, Alderman LaSpada. Any other questions or comments from members? All right.

Before we move on, I'd like to note that we have been joined by Alderwoman Harris, who will be added to the quorum call. Welcome, Alderwoman Harris. So I'd like to say a few words on this item.

Obviously, as a proud gay man and as a Chicagoan, house music is very near and dear to my heart. House music is one of the many gifts that Chicago has given to the world. And it was born at the warehouse with DJs like Frankie Knuckles, openly gay men, lesbian women, queer people, trans people who were expressing resilience in the face of hostility and hate.

Who refused to be put down and who chose instead to celebrate love and life. And I'm very happy that this weekend, the Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events will be hosting the Chicago House Music Festival and Conference. And that will include a panel on this very landmarking at 6.15 p.m. at the Chicago Cultural Center on Friday at the Preston Bradley Hall. The panel is titled Activism, the Fight to Preserve House's History. And they will talk to members of the house music community that got the ball rolling and made sure that we could get to this point of landmarking this item and voting on its landmarking in committee today. And then, of course, the festival itself will be on Saturday, June 24th from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. in the 26th Ward at the Humboldt Park Boathouse. So perhaps Alderman Fuentes will be there getting down to some house music. So if there are no more questions by committee members, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? All right.

Alderman Villegas moves do pass. Are there any objections?

[Speaker 12] (38:24 - 38:34)
Hearing none, the designation is passed. All right. Next, we have one application for an administrative adjustment.

[Speaker 1] (38:34 - 38:54)
File number 23-133-AA, the application of an administrative adjustment for Friendly Tavern, LLC, located at 6124 West Gunnison Street. We have Zoning Administrator Patrick Murphy here to explain the need for the administrative adjustment. And we have the attorney for the applicant here to answer any questions.

Mr. Murphy. Hi, good morning.

[Speaker 11] (38:54 - 39:26)
Thank you, Chairman. Patrick Murphy with the Department of Planning. There are a number of administrative adjustments that the City Council has given the Zoning Bureau and Zoning Administrator's Office authority to make decisions upon based on the notice that's required and the criteria that applies.

In this case, with the transferring of a liquor license in a tavern that is on property that is zoned residential requires an additional step, which is what we're hearing today. And it's the hearing before this committee. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (39:27 - 40:43)
Thank you so much, Mr. Murphy. We do have Alderman Jim Gardner's support for this item. If there are no questions by committee members for the attorney, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine form?

Alderman La Spada moves do pass. Are there any objections? Hearing none, the adjustment is passed.

Moving right along. Last up on the addendum are large signs over 100 square feet in area, 24 feet above grade. We will hear them all together.

I will read the ward followed by the address and take a motion at the end. In the second Ward 633 West North Avenue, third Ward 1319 South State Street, third Ward 2808 South Michigan Avenue, eighth Ward 939 East 95th Street, 10th Ward 3940 East 106th Street, 11th Ward 944 West 38th Place, 11th Ward 3659 South Ashland Avenue. Three signs in the 27th Ward at 1500 North Clyburn Avenue, 27th Ward at 1129 North Wales, 27th Ward 333 South Halsted, 27th Ward 320 North Damon Avenue, 27th Ward 600 West Chicago Avenue, 27th Ward 1730 West Fullerton Avenue, 27th Ward 451 North Elizabeth Street, 27th Ward 1550 West Carroll Street.

Five signs, five more signs in the 27th Ward located at 1242 West Washington Boulevard.

[Speaker 2] (40:43 - 41:06)
Two signs in the 28th Ward located. I think you need to be one of those auctioneers, you know you're pretty good. But, but also 333 North Halsted just want to make a note that's now in the 34th Ward.

333 South Halsted. South Halsted's 34th Ward. Yes.

All right.

[Speaker 25] (41:07 - 41:11)
And so, needless to say, I absolutely approve of this, of this sign.

[Speaker 1] (41:11 - 42:09)
Thank you so much for that clarification. So in the 34th Ward 333 South Halsted. Two signs in the 28th Ward located at 516 South Loomis Street, two signs in the 32nd Ward at 1720 North Damon Street in the 34th Ward 947 West Van Buren Street in the 40th Ward 5414 North Clark Street in the 44th Ward 838 838 Patton Drive, and lastly one sign in the 42nd Ward located at 656 West Randolph Street.

If there are no questions by committee members, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Alderwoman Fuentes moves do pass. Are there any objections?

Hearing none, the orders are passed. We will now move on to the regular agenda. In an effort to ensure the committee meeting runs as smoothly as possible, the typical order in which these items will be heard has been updated.

Items will be grouped together according to witness and will be heard in that order, rather than ward order.

[Speaker 12] (42:16 - 42:18)
So first up we have aldermanic introductions.

[Speaker 1] (42:19 - 43:43)
Is Alderman Curtis here or a representative from his staff? Alderman Curtis. All right, we will hold these items until the end to give Alderman Curtis an opportunity to join us.

Next up, do we have Alderman Riley here or representative of his staff? Okay, this item will also be held until the end of the meeting to give Alderman Riley an opportunity to join us. So moving on to the next page.

We have number 20951T1 in the third ward. Ordinance for forward 22322. The common address is 5339 to 5353 South State Street and 2 to 16 East 54th Street.

And this is for an M1-2 limited manufacturing slash business park district to B3-2 community shopping district. We do have to accept a substitute narrative and plans. So Vice Chairman Lawson moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Are there any objections? Hearing none, the substitute narrative and plans are before us. We have attorney Stephen Friedland, who is here to speak on this application.

[Speaker 5] (43:43 - 45:32)
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My name is Steve Friedland. I'm an attorney with Applegate and Thorne Thompson here on behalf of Deeply Rooted Dance Theater.

With me today is Makeda Creighton, who's the executive director of Deeply Rooted and our project architect, Bill Johnson. This is a project where Deeply Rooted is looking to build itself a new home. It would be a studio that would have both performance and dance education.

It's located, as you indicated, at the northeast corner of State and 54th Street. Deeply Rooted Dance Theater is a longstanding, over 25-year history organization that has done dance performance all throughout Chicago, the nation, and the world. And dance education is a big part of their project and their mission.

They would be partnering with other organizations in this building and doing other dance theater and performance with other not-for-profit organizations. The facility that will be built on this site, the site is currently vacant. It's owned by the City of Chicago and will be conveyed to Deeply Rooted.

There'll be an approximately 30,000 square foot facility. We have worked extensively with the Department of Planning and Development on the design of the project. And that's the reason for the substitute narrative and plans.

We've updated our plans after working with the city design staff. We would certainly take any questions you might have and appreciate your support.

[Speaker 1] (45:32 - 45:39)
All right, are there any questions on this item? Alderman Spada?

[Speaker 13] (45:39 - 45:48)
Sir, are there designs or renderings that we should be looking at, or is it within the existing structure? No, this is new.

[Speaker 5] (45:49 - 46:16)
It may be that I did send some of our materials over to Nicole, but I think I sent them yesterday when you guys were closed. So, Nicole, you probably do not have them to put up right now. But, Alderman, we would certainly be willing to share them with you.

This is a Type 1 rezoning, so those plans and specifications are included with our ordinance that's required as part of the Type 1.

[Speaker 12] (46:19 - 46:35)
Okay, no further questions at the moment. Thank you. Thank you, and we can get those to you, Alderman Spada.

Are there any other questions or comments from committee members? All right. Okay, Alderman Dower.

[Speaker 10] (46:36 - 47:39)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Alderman Spada, let me assure you that the design is phenomenal. Sitting next to me is the architect, Phil Johnson. His design that I've seen is pedestrian friendly, has windows along State Street, has designated areas for performance venue and dance education inside the building.

I am truly excited about this development. I've been wanting to have deeply rooted in my community. They could go anywhere.

But I've been wanting to have them in the Third Ward and Washington Park community, they will be located for those of you that know the community. Just east of excess tennis on the other side of the street. And I am thrilled that we're moving forward with this development and ask for the committee support.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (47:42 - 49:06)
All right. Any other questions or comments. All right, so hearing none.

Do I have a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Alderman Dower moves to pass. Are there any objections.

All right, hearing none, the item is passed. Mr. Friedland if you could please resend those plans one more time just to make sure the committee has them and we'll share them with the members. All right, so moving along.

Number 21125 also in the Third Ward ordinance referred to September 21, 2022. The address is 45 to 79 East 18th Street 1801 to 1809 South Wabash Street and 1800 to 1806 South Michigan Avenue. This is for a DX5 downtown mixed use district to DR3 downtown residential district to DR5 downtown residential district, then to a residential plan development.

This item was heard and passed by the Chicago Plan Commission. Can I have a motion to incorporate all records and findings from that hearing by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Alderman LaSpada.

So moves. Are there any objections. All right, hearing none, the plan commission records are incorporated.

So once again we have Mr. Friedland here to speak on this item.

[Speaker 5] (49:07 - 50:16)
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman again for the record, Steve Friedland attorney with Applegate Thorntops and two quick matters to take care of. In your introduction, you indicated that it was a rezoning from DX5 to DR3. It's actually currently the property has both a DX5 and a DR3 designation.

The rezoning is to the DR5, and then to the plan development, just so that we're clear in the record. Both of those existing classifications will be rezoned to the DR5 and then to the PD, just so we're clear. With that, I'm here today on behalf of Mercy Housing, I have with me Todd Walcott from Mercy Housing, and for our project architect Nia Architects, Yvonne Harleston's here.

This is a project that has an existing building, an existing SRO building at the corner of Wabash and 18th Street, and there is an adjacent. Mr. Friedland, yes, I'll do one now.

[Speaker 10] (50:17 - 50:23)
Because this is a project that I think we should have drawings for right.

[Speaker 12] (50:25 - 50:34)
Nicole, is it possible to Yeah, I sent you a chat yesterday, Nicole.

[Speaker 10] (50:37 - 50:59)
Is it possible we can hold this until later in the agenda to see if we can get the Sure, absolutely. Because this is a complex development, it's not just an existing development. It's also a new build on Michigan and 18th, and I would like my colleagues to see that.

[Speaker 1] (50:59 - 51:21)
Of course, yes, I'll do it now. So, Mr. Friedland, we will hold this item to allow time for our committee staff to pull up the plans that you sent over yesterday on Juneteenth, and then we will take that item up when we're able to project them onto the screen. If you could make sure to email them once again so that we have them in our inbox.

[Speaker 31] (51:22 - 51:26)
We're going to move to the top of page three.

[Speaker 1] (51:26 - 52:05)
All right, so moving along, do we have Mr. Rolando Acosta here with us. He will be the attorney presenting on the next many items. So, number 22171 in the first ward ordinance referred for 19 2023.

Good morning Mr Chairman members of the committee Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant. The banner banner before you involves a building on the north side of Belden just west of Western Avenue. That is in serious need of repair.

The applicant purchased the building, it currently has four units in the front. And there's a separate coach house building in the rear coach house building in the rear will remain as is it will be rehabbed internally. The front building has four small units.

The proposal is to build an addition essentially raise the roof. So the SEC the upper floor can be duplex into what is currently the attic and create four units that are three and four bedrooms so their family size units and accommodate families in the neighborhood. The applicant will be working with go to school, trying to attract families from that school to reside on the property there is no parking on the property.

The rezoning is needed because of the added far for a ratio to this building as a result of the increasing height on the roof. The matter was vetted at a community meeting held by Alderman La Spada. We have his letter of support but he is also here.

I don't know if he wishes to speak on this matter.

[Speaker 1] (53:22 - 54:21)
All right. Before we take questions or testimony we do have to amend this to a type one. So, Vice Chair Lawson moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Are there any objections. Hearing none the substitute narrative and plans are accepted. Any questions or comments from committee members, Alderman Riley.

Yes, welcome Alderman Riley and we're also joined by Alderman Beal. Welcome to both of you. All right.

Hearing none, the item is passed as amended. Thank you so much. Thank you.

Have a good day. Thank you. Okay, so we are moving on to page three.

And we are now on Mr causes. Second item number 22142 t one in the first ward, the ordinance was referred on March 15 2023. It's at 1235 to 37 North Ashton Avenue and this is a B3 dash to community shopping district to be to dash three neighborhood district.

We do have to accept substitute narrative and plans. So vice chairman Lawson moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Are there any objections.

Hearing none, the substitute narrative and plans are accepted. Mr Costa.

[Speaker 4] (1:00:27 - 1:02:17)
Good morning again Mr Chairman, members of the committee Rolando Costa here on behalf of the applicant, the subject properties on the east side of Ashland just north of Division Street, immediately east of Milwaukee. It is a transit serve location not only from the CTAs blue line via the Division Street station, but also because of the actual bus line, where the property fronts, the Division Street bus line which is approximately 360 feet away, and the Milwaukee Avenue bus line which is approximately 137 feet away. The proposal is currently improved with a one story commercial building and a two story mixed use building.

The proposal by the applicant is to demolish the existing structures and build a five story mixed use building with 1460 square feet of ground floor commercial space 16 dwelling units on the upper floors and and close parking for four cars at the rear of the property. The property, the project initially when it started was in the second ward, we went through a community process under the alderman options guidance, we see the letter of support. Since then, with the property transferring to the first ward matter was deferred so that alderman La Spada, we could undertake a community process under alderman La Spada, we did so.

This property received I think many favorable responses, it will yield three affordable units under the ETO D that will be located on site of the 16 units. There were comments with respect to the aesthetics of the building, primarily the front facade. We have modified it to satisfy those comments and that is the reason for the substitute narrative and plans.

We do have a letter of support but I know that all the most part is also here with that I'll answer any questions committee may have any questions or comments from members.

[Speaker 1] (1:02:18 - 1:02:21)
All right, so, I'll jump in the spot.

[Speaker 13] (1:02:22 - 1:02:50)
Yes, thank you, Chairman just wanted to say like my number one my thanks to Alderman Hopkins for agreeing to defer the matter to the new term, my thanks to the team for coming together for community meeting with our residents on this and also the architect for working through some revisions that I think all would agree like greatly enhanced the aesthetics of what we're building both at this lot and then with the case that's going to be coming up next. Thank you, Jim.

[Speaker 1] (1:02:51 - 1:02:56)
And I believe alderman Hopkins who's joining us virtually has his hand up alderman Hopkins.

[Speaker 27] (1:02:57 - 1:04:09)
Yeah, thank you, Mr Chairman, just briefly, I would point out that a number of the changes were made prior to the handoff. We did set back the upper floor significantly so it really won't be viewed from a great level doesn't actually reduce the height of the building that reduces the appearance of the height of the building and that was at the request of the community. And then when I handed this project off to Alderman La Spada, under his leadership, further improvements were made as counsel mentioned, some of the aesthetic changes.

So, this project is much better now for having had to community processes one under the second ward and then under the first word. So I'm grateful to all involved. And of course, like anything, you know the satisfaction level with the changes isn't 100%.

Some of the members of the community organization remain opposed but I would just point out that this is a significant improvement in the use of this parcel over its current use so it's, you know, looking at that way to alderman have done their best to make it better. And we think we're at a point where we can support this project and I intend to vote aye, as I'm sure my colleague, Alderman La Spada does as well.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:09 - 1:05:08)
Thank you. Thank you so much. Any other questions or comments from members.

All right, if there are no more questions by committee members do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum Alderman La Spada moves do pass. Are there any objections. Hearing none, the item is passed as amended.

Okay. Number 22143 t one in the first ward ordinance referred March 15 2023 at 1257 to 1301 North Ashton Avenue. This is a B3 dash two community shopping district to be to dash three neighborhood mix use district.

And we have a substitute narrative and plans, so Vice Chair Lawson moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Are there any objections. Hearing none, the substitute narrative and plans are accepted, Mr Costa.

[Speaker 4] (1:05:08 - 1:06:19)
Good morning again Rolando Acosta on behalf of the applicant, similar to the last project. This is on the east side of Ashland Avenue just further north down the block, it's the property is currently improved with a one story commercial building a three story mixed use building, and a four story mixed use building there's no parking on site. The applicant, which is also the applicant in the prior matter proposes demolish the existing structures and build a five story building.

This one will contain 2750 square feet of ground floor commercial, a total of 24 residential dwelling units and parking for 10 cars in an enclosed garage. This is also a transit serve location to Ashland Avenue, the division street bus line Milwaukee Avenue, and the division street CTA blue line station. Under the T E TO D five affordable units will be included on site as part of this project.

It was vetted through the same process under the second ward and the first word as a prior project, and also, we have made a static changes to satisfy the comments received from the community. With that, we are happy to answer any questions, questions or comments from members.

[Speaker 1] (1:06:20 - 1:06:53)
All right, if there are no questions by committee members do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call as used to determine quorum alderman less bottom moves do pass. Are there any objections. Hearing none, the item is passed as amended.

Okay, moving on to page four, number two to 189 in the 11th ward ordinance referred March 24 2023. This is at 3316 to 18 South Morgan Street, and this is a B to dash to neighborhood mixed use district to be to dash three neighborhood mixed use district Mr Costa.

[Speaker 4] (1:06:54 - 1:08:02)
Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant. This property currently has a two story building that contains eight units permits for all eight units cannot be found. The current applicant purchased the property in its current condition and wishes to rehab this property to improve its state, and also bring it into conformance.

As part of a neighborhood outreach and community process spearheaded by alderman Lee. It was decided that six units would be more appropriate for this property so the applicant has decided to reduce the number of units from the current eight that had no permits to six. Unfortunately, the property is a insufficient size to support the six units without the rezoning.

We tried to look for historical records to find whether the six units had been there for 20 years or not. We have been unable to do so, and we are required to rezone it to be two three so we can effectuate the plan that was arrived at through the community process. We have the support of Alderman Lee, and she has submitted a letter to that effect, happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (1:08:03 - 1:09:11)
Thank you so much, Mr Costa as was noted, other woman, Lee is in support are there any questions or comments. All right, hearing none. Do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum alderman convincing moves do pass, are there any objections.

Hearing none, the item is passed. All right, so we are going to number two to 154 in the 32nd Ward ordinance referred April 19 2023. This is at 1653 to 1739 West Webster Avenue and 2075 to 2189 North Austin Avenue.

This is a residential business plan development number 1420, as amended to residential business plan development number 1420, as amended, we're going to incorporate some records here, so the item was heard and passed by the Chicago plane commission. Can I have a motion to incorporate all records and findings from that hearing by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum alderman Lawson so moves. Are there any objections.

Hearing none, the records are incorporated.

[Speaker 4] (1:09:12 - 1:10:26)
Mr Costa Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant. The subject property is on Elston, just south of Webster, it is currently improved with two buildings, the condominium building that fronts along Webster, and an apartment building mixed use with commercial ground floor that fronts along Elston across from the Best Buy Kohl's shopping center. The proposed amendment only affects sub area a which is a sub area that contains the apartment building with the commercial ground floor, the applicant proposes to occupy 3500 square feet in the existing commercial space for a dog training facility.

The plan development prior to this amendment did not allow for animal services on the property. So the amendment to sub area is merely to add that use as a permitted use on the within that sub area to allow the applicant to establish her business at that location. We, the alderman has vetted this through the community.

We have to receive no objections to this proposal, as the chairman noted, it went through the plan commission which unanimously recommended approval, and we have a letter of support from the alderman. If there are any questions we'd be happy to answer them.

[Speaker 1] (1:10:27 - 1:11:09)
Thank you so much as noted alderman waggis back is in support of this item. Are there any questions by committee members. All right, hearing none, I do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum alderman dowel moves do pass are there any objections, hearing none, the item is passed as revised.

[Speaker 4] (1:11:10 - 1:11:52)
Good morning again, Rolando Costa here on behalf of the applicant. The subject property is improved with a two and a half story residential building. It has two units on the upper floor, and it has a third unit.

It was constructed at some time in the past in the basement. The proposal before you is to rezone the property from RS three to RT for in order to bring the basement unit into conformity, essentially allow enough MLA on the property, so that that unit can be legalized. We have discussed this with alderman mitts, and she has written a letter of support which I believe the committee has.

We are happy to answer any questions that there may be any questions or comments from members.

[Speaker 1] (1:11:52 - 1:12:26)
All right, as noted all the woman minutes is in support of this item. If there are no questions do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum older woman Harris moves do pass. Are there any objections.

Hearing none, the item is passed. Moving on number two to 188 in the 49th Ward ordinance referred 524 23. This is at 7229 North Damon Avenue, this is an RT for residential to flat townhouse and multi unit district to RM 4.5 residential multi unit district.

[Speaker 4] (1:12:27 - 1:13:28)
Mr Costa Rolando Acosta here on behalf of the applicant. The subject properties on the east side of North Damon Avenue it's currently improved with a three story building. Each of those upper floors has one unit in, in them on them.

The basement however is vacant. It has enough space and enough height that it could be converted into a dwelling unit. All three existing units currently are affordable housing the basement is also to be affordable housing.

The rezoning that is proposed is merely to allow the conversion of the basement from vacant to a affordable housing unit. There is no parking on the property because it is landlocked and has no access other than from Damon Avenue and of course the building is in the way of getting to the rear of the property, we held a community meeting with Alderman hadn't present. There were no objections from the community and we have a letter of support from the older woman.

Should there be any questions and be happy to answer them.

[Speaker 1] (1:13:28 - 1:13:49)
Any questions or comments from members. All right, as noted all the woman had an is in support. And do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum alderman Hall moves do pass.

Are there any objections. Hearing none, the item is passed.

[Speaker 10] (1:13:51 - 1:13:51)
Excellent.

[Speaker 12] (1:13:53 - 1:13:53)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:13:54 - 1:14:39)
Thank you, Mr chairman. Thank you so much, Mr. Acosta. Okay, so we are moving back to page one to the alderman X alderman Riley is here with us.

So this is number a dash 8830 in the 42nd Ward ordinance referred March 15 2023. We have to incorporate some records here. This is for a residential business plan development number 1092 to residential business plan development number 1092 as amended.

So this item was heard and passed by the Chicago Plan Commission. Can I have a motion to incorporate all records and findings from the hearing by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum alderman Riley so moves.

[Speaker 12] (1:14:39 - 1:14:53)
Any objections. Hearing none. The records are incorporated alderman Riley Do you want to speak on your item.

I would briefly for the record.

[Speaker 24] (1:14:54 - 1:16:34)
And I also had submitted a letter to the Department of Planning and Development to Patrick Murphy the zoning administrator with the rationale behind this aldermanic amendment these are rare in the 42nd Ward. However, this was a plan development that was negotiated. One of the first actually that I negotiated as an alderman, a long time ago.

And one of the community benefits was that the open space on this site would be dedicated to public use. This is a historic firehouse it's a landmark. And next to it, they use the air rights to construct a new multi unit rental building.

And because this is such an old PD, as we all know, there are times when attorneys, try to take advantage of short memory and ask for minor changes from the Department of Planning in this particular case that occurred in the people processing that minor change we're not aware of the history behind this site, and the public benefit we negotiated. And so, through a series of minor change requests they were essentially trying to turn what was negotiated to be public space for residents and visitors to use into a private patio space to accommodate a future restaurant. And because there was some ambiguity in the plan development.

It was obviously necessary that I introduced this amendment to clarify that point. So that is all this is doing is memorializing an agreement that was struck many years ago to prevent the current owners from taking advantage of that long period of time it's elapsed since it was approved. That said, I'd appreciate my colleagues support for the amendment.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:16:34 - 1:17:41)
Are there any questions or comments on this item. All right, so if there are no questions by committee members, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Alderman Hopkins so moves.

It's at 8101 to 8159 South sister Avenue. And this is a B one dash two neighborhood shopping district to be three dash two community shopping district and we have attorney Nicholas fatigues here to speak on this item.

[Speaker 9] (1:17:42 - 1:18:26)
Morning Chairman Nick fatigue is again for the record, I'm here on behalf of the property owner, nor core, nor core Cicero associates LLC. They are seeking a zoning change in order to permit the establishment of a laundromat which requires to be three zoning district as an allowed or permitted use. Otherwise, though, the one story multi unit strip mall or retail building will remain without change.

So this is a use space zoning change. We did discuss this request with Alderman Curtis and I believe a letter of support is already on file. I'd be happy to answer any questions you are the committee members have any questions or comments from members.

[Speaker 1] (1:18:27 - 1:19:09)
All right, if there are no questions by committee members do I hear motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Alderman Knudson moves to pass. Are there any objections.

[Speaker 9] (1:19:09 - 1:20:06)
Thank you again, the zoning change in this case. I'm here on behalf of center court development LLC, the applicant the applicant is actually a contract purchaser from the city of Chicago. The property itself contains about 33,877 square feet of vacant unimproved land.

The applicant is proposing to develop the property with three two story townhome buildings containing a total of 17 dwelling units. Each of the dwelling units will have onsite parking. So a total of 34 spaces to support the development.

This actually started under Alderman doll as Alderman after the word change the applicant did reach out to Alderman Taylor, and we confirmed actually with your office at Alderman Taylor was also in support of the project so with that we'd be happy to answer any questions you have about the project. Other women down.

[Speaker 10] (1:20:07 - 1:20:21)
Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman, on behalf of Alderman Taylor and I, we both support this project which is a support of housing that will be part of the excess tennis campus. Thank you.

Thank you so much. Alderman Espada.

[Speaker 9] (1:20:25 - 1:20:44)

And then the point for bales will be complied I believe with the payment in lieu consistent with the arrow guidelines.

[Speaker 1] (1:20:47 - 1:21:19)
Thank you. Any other questions or comments from members. All right, hearing none.

Do I hear motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. All the women down moves do pass. Are there any objections.

Hearing none, the item is passed. Moving on to number two to 15836 in the 36th Ward. This ordinance was referred on April 19 2023, this is at 2600 West, Iowa Street, and this is an RS three residential single unit detached house district to see one dash

[Speaker 9] (1:21:19 - 1:22:15)
one neighborhood commercial district, Mr Petit case again Chairman, for the record I'm here on behalf of the Arthur Baroque 2005 trust the owner of the property at 2600 West, Iowa Street, the property itself is improved with a mixed use building containing a tavern at grade, and then a total of eight residential units above the taverns actually a bit of a neighborhood establishment, and originally had one of I believe three hams advertising signs it's an on premise advertising sign at the corner. We were not able to find a permit for the original installation of that site again dating back 70 plus years.

And in working with all of them in Vegas, we are hoping to seek it or hoping to obtain a zoning change so that we can properly permit the reestablishment of that side. Otherwise the building itself and the current operator will all remain without change.

[Speaker 1] (1:22:15 - 1:22:32)
Thank you so much before taking questions and comments I'd like to note that older woman clay has joined us, and she will be added to the roll call and we are now at 100% attendance. All right, so are there any questions or comments for Mr Petit case. I'll remember Vegas.

[Speaker 22] (1:22:33 - 1:23:59)
Thank you. Thank you, Mr Chairman, I want to thank Pat Murphy for for assisting with this, this is a little history here this sign was installed back in the 1940s, and it's been a neighborhood staple for decades, and as Mr Petit has stated, you know, this is one of three remaining ham signs in the country. And this establishment happens to be the number one seller of hams beer in the Midwest selling 10s of thousands of beers.

I'm not a hams beer drinker but for those that enjoy it. God bless up this was this was something that unfortunately bureaucracy gotten away. And this sign had to be taken down after decades of being installed.

And so I can tell you that getting familiar with this area during during the election cycle, time and time again I heard when is the sign going back up. And so we challenged the Department of zoning and Mr Murphy came up with a solution that I can tell you it's just in time because this establishment will be celebrating their 80th year in business this past this weekend with a with a huge block party, and we scheduled the sign to be reinstalled, I think tomorrow. So I want to thank the Patrick Murphy and his team for finding a solution for take us for taking on this, this issue, and I asked for the body's considerations in support of this, this change.

Any questions or comments.

[Speaker 1] (1:23:59 - 1:24:38)
All right, so if there are no questions or comments by members do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum alderman Vegas moves do pass are there any objections. Hearing none, the item is passed. Okay, so we are moving on to number 22152 in the 41st Ward ordinance referred April 19 2023.

This is at 5207 West Rose Street, and this is a B3 dash one community shopping district to see to dash one motor vehicle related commercial district, Mr fatigas.

[Speaker 9] (1:24:38 - 1:25:34)
Thank you again, Nick fatigue is on behalf of the property owner and applicant regarding 505207 West Rose Street, the subject property contains about 13,786 square feet of total lot area, and it's improved with a two story warehouse and office building. The applicants are seeking a zoning change in order to permit the indoor and outdoor storage of vehicles at the subject property. The anticipated tenant is actually a concierge transportation company, they have cars that will be stored again on site both in the warehouse building as well as surface parking along the perimeter of the site, the building itself though will remain without change.

And all of the infrastructure at the property will support the proposed use. We did meet with Alderman Napolitano as well as the 41st Ward Zone Advisory Council, and the alderman did issue a letter of support that should already be on file. And with that I'd be happy to answer any questions you or the committee members have.

[Speaker 1] (1:25:34 - 1:26:49)
Thank you as noted. Alderman Napolitano is in support. Are there any questions or comments from committee members.

All right, if there are none. Do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Alderman Fuentes moves to pass.

Are there any objections. Hearing none, the item is passed. Thank you, sir.

All right, so do we have Sarah Barnes in the house. Attorney Sarah Barnes. All right.

So, this is on page seven, number 22136 in the 32nd Ward. The ordinance was referred on March 15, 2023. This is common address 1354 West diversity Parkway.

And this is a B3 dash two community shopping district to be to dash to neighborhood mixed use district. We have to amend this to a type one. So, Vice Chair Lawson moves to amend the application to a type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Are there any objections. Hearing none, the item is amended to a type one application, and we have attorney Sarah K Barnes here to present.

[Speaker 17] (1:26:49 - 1:29:16)
Thank you. Good morning, Mr. Chairman and esteemed members of the committee for the record once more. My name is Sarah Barnes and I'm an attorney at the last is Sam banks.

I do have seated here next to me for introduction to all of you. I'm Nicole Lopatinsky. She's interning with us this summer.

I just wanted to introduce you because if she survives her third year of law school at Kent College, hopefully soon she'll be appearing right here before all of you. So, welcome Nicole to this experience. I'm towards those ends I'm here today seeking a zoning map amendment that's really related to the use of the subject property on this subject site is located on a stretch of diversity Avenue that still bears the underlying zoning classification of a B3, which is a mixed use category.

Yet all of the existing improvements on this block are all residential and character and nature. So we are simply changing the zoning from the B3 to the B2 to allow for a new three or four story, three units, all residential building that will be more compatible with the other existing improvements in the neighborhood and it will also provide some more economically responsible family housing for the residents of this neighborhood, who have kind of been outpriced due to the emergence of these D converted single family homes.

So with that we have worked very closely with alderman wagus back as well as a very robust collaborative effort with the local community organization the South Lake view neighbors Association. We had a community meeting recently that was very well attended and I think maybe for the first time in my 14 year career zoning, we had unanimous support from every single person who participated in the community meeting so we do have a letter of support from the South Lake view neighbors Association as well as alderman wagus back and that letter from alderman wagus back has been tendered to the committee prior here to with that we just respectfully request the support of the committee for the proposal.

[Speaker 1] (1:29:17 - 1:29:38)
Thank you and we do have that letter from alderman wagus back on file. Are there any questions or comments on this item. All right, if there are none.

Do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. All the women dowel moves do pass. Are there any objections.

Hearing none, the item is passed as amended to a type one.

[Speaker 17] (1:29:38 - 1:29:39)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:29:39 - 1:31:30)
Thank you so much. Miss Barnes, okay so we are now going to take a motion to defer the next three items. That's number two to 163 in the eighth ward at 7740 to 44 South, South Chicago Avenue, and then number two to 195 dash t one in the 11th ward.

That's common address 3030 South Canal Street, and then number two to 177 in the 20th ward. That's 6615 South Kenwood Avenue. So do I hear a motion to defer these items.

All right, so moved by alderman more so alderman more has made a motion to defer the previously read items by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Are there any objections. Hearing none.

Oh, apologies. Alderman Burnett moved to defer the previously read items by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. So there any objections to Alderman Burnett's motion to defer.

All right, hearing none. Those three items are deferred. Okay, so we are on page eight is attorney Roberto Roberto Martinez.

So this is number two to 196 in the 15th ward. The ordinance was referred 524 23, and this is at 6348 to 6350 South Albany Avenue. This is an RS three residential single unit detached house district to RT for residential two flat townhouse and multi unit district.

Mr. Martinez.

[Speaker 29] (1:31:31 - 1:32:47)
Good morning attorney Martinez appearing on behalf of the applicant. Here, the applicant is seeking to rezone from an RS three to an RT for the subject properly property is currently improved with a four unit building, which the applicant seeks to now use as a six dwelling unit building. The building is approximately 42 feet in width and contains four units.

There are two basement spaces available, which the applicant intends to now use with plans as additional dwelling units. The property is also improved with a four car garage, and has a total width of 75 feet, meaning that it is three lots with three separate identification numbers, and the applicant asked that the zoning committee, consider granting this rezoning, so that the applicant may add to dwelling units and create a building where there will be a total of six dwelling units from a four dwelling unit building.

[Speaker 1] (1:32:48 - 1:33:07)
And we have heard from alderman Lopez who is in support of this item. Are there any questions or comments from members. All right, seeing none.

Do I have a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum alderman Conway moves do pass. Are there any objections. Hearing none, the item is passed.

[Speaker 29] (1:33:08 - 1:33:09)
Thank you have a wonderful day.

[Speaker 1] (1:33:10 - 1:34:11)
Thank you. All right, staying on page eight number 22179 in the 18th ward. The ordinance was referred March 24 2023.

This is at 7901 to 8071 South Cicero Avenue 4744 to 4760 West 81st Street and 4649 to 4711 West 79th Street. This is a business plan development number 965 to business plan development number 965, as amended, we have to incorporate some records. So the item was heard and passed by the Chicago Plan Commission, and I have a motion to incorporate all records and findings from that hearing by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Alderwoman Fuentes so moves. Are there any objections. Hearing none, the records are incorporated, and we have all shadow and Mariah Degrino from DLA Piper here to present.

[Speaker 15] (1:34:11 - 1:36:09)
My name is Mariah Degrino with DLA Piper, and joined by Abe Katz, who is here on behalf of the owner of the shopping center Scottsdale Center LLC. As you noted the matter was considered and recommended for approval by the plan commission on June 15. We are seeking an amendment to plan development number 965.

The PD was approved in 2005, and governs the approximately 20 acre site located at 79th and Cicero, commonly known as Scottsdale Shopping Center. The shopping center itself was built in 1955 as one of Chicago's first auto oriented shopping centers. The PD was established in 2005 to facilitate updates, including development of the Lowe's Home Improvement Center and various retail and restaurant buildings.

The amendment today would add a cannabis business establishment to the list of permitted uses in the center, subject to special use approvals. Cannabis business establishments are allowed in the underlying C2 district, which are also subject to special use approvals. However, when the PD was established in 2005, cannabis uses were prohibited under Illinois law, thus that use was not contemplated for the PD at that time.

This amendment would bring the allowed uses of the PD into conformance with the current standards of the underlying C2 district by allowing cannabis business establishments, also subject to special use approvals. If the amendment is required, the ZBA would need to approve a special use before the opening of any cannabis business establishment in the center. The parties have previously conducted two community-wide meetings, and as noted, the potential tenant would need to obtain approval of the special use.

The tenant cannot begin that process until this PD amendment is approved. Alderman Curtis has provided a letter of support. I respectfully request this committee's favorable recommendation that the application be approved, and we are here to answer any questions you might have.

[Speaker 1] (1:36:10 - 1:36:21)
We have heard from Mr. Curtis. Alderman Curtis, he is supportive of this matter. Are there any questions or comments?

All right. Oh, Alderman Lawson. Thank you.

[Speaker 34] (1:36:22 - 1:36:27)
Is there a user, or are we just changing the PD to allow for potential future use?

[Speaker 15] (1:36:27 - 1:36:32)
There is a user in mind that is sort of instigating all of this process here today.

[Speaker 1] (1:36:32 - 1:36:33)
And they're engaging with the community already?

[Speaker 15] (1:36:33 - 1:36:35)
They are very engaged with the community already, yes.

[Speaker 1] (1:36:35 - 1:36:39)
Thanks. We also have a question from Alderman Villegas.

[Speaker 22] (1:36:41 - 1:36:46)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Is the user part of an equity team?

[Speaker 15] (1:36:46 - 1:36:50)
It is. Yes, they are a social equity applicant, yes.

[Speaker 12] (1:36:50 - 1:36:58)
Thank you. Any other questions or comments? Alderman Burnett.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 2] (1:36:58 - 1:37:03)
So this is just an amendment to this plan development, not all plan development?

[Speaker 12] (1:37:05 - 1:37:06)
In fact, this plan development.

[Speaker 1] (1:37:08 - 1:38:03)
Plan development number 965. Correct. Other questions or comments?

All right. So if there are no more questions or comments by committee members, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderman LaSpada moves do pass.

Are there any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed. Thank you so much, Mariah.

[Speaker 1] (1:50:00 - 1:50:03)
Okay, do we have any questions or comments from members.

[Speaker 13] (1:50:05 - 1:50:24)
Alderman La Spada. Rich, thank you so much for the presentation, really and truly a gorgeous looking building. I'm curious, as we're talking about residential and this came into the conversations when we were talking about McKinsey to last year.

How, how does this development satisfy its arrow requirements.

[Speaker 7] (1:50:25 - 1:50:34)
It's what the affordable requirements ordinance. Oh, sorry. All 20% will be located on site at AMI levels at a weighted average of 60%.

[Speaker 13] (1:50:34 - 1:50:48)
Awesome. Beautiful. Do you mind if I ask about the the unit mix in terms of studio one bedroom.

I missed the plan commission, it was my first plan commission meeting, and I was out of town. So, apologies for the backup question.

[Speaker 7] (1:50:48 - 1:50:53)
No problem. I'm going to let our studios answer that question. I've got it in front of me I gotta dig for it.

[Speaker 14] (1:50:55 - 1:51:10)
We have a mix of one studios one season threes, and it's generally dispersed throughout, you know, we have a less amount of three bedrooms, but we do have three bedrooms so we have. So the affordable will be dispersed throughout that unit mix.

[Speaker 13] (1:51:11 - 1:51:16)
That's really brilliant really appreciate the family size units there. Thank you. Thank you, Chairman.

Thank you all.

[Speaker 1] (1:51:16 - 1:51:29)
And for the record, the gentleman that just spoke if you could put your name on the record. Aristides Lucas with Lucas development. Thank you so much.

Thanks. Alderman Burnett would you like to speak on this item.

[Speaker 2] (1:51:29 - 1:54:29)
Sure. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and if I'm not mistaken, with the arrow units, it has to be dispersed proportionately to the other sizes of the units in the building. So if they so percentage wise they have to have so many three so many to so many ones, depending on how many is in the building as a whole.

So, first of all, thank you again, Mr. Chairman. As you all know, this did go before plan commission is a very beautiful building is going into the western part of our ward on the 1300 block almost close to Ogden Street is taken over a space from a. One of the best meat meat purveyors in the city of Chicago priori of packing.

As I said at the plan commission, I had a community meeting. I always make developers go to all of the community organizations at the community meeting. The main thing that people was concerned about is, where's Peoria packing going?

Are they going to allow for Peoria packing to stay in the building? Because that's where everybody began to meet from for a long time. Fortunate for the alderman and 24th Ward Peoria packing is moving to the 24th Ward, but we are encouraging them to also have a satellite office over here.

And I guess those conversations are going on is a beautiful building. We appreciate the fact that they're going to do 20 percent in set the building on site. As you know, north of Lake Street in my ward in this area in a full market area, housing encourages 30 percent.

There's another 10 percent that they encourage with subsidies coming from the city. So they're in negotiation with the developer in order to gain 10 more percent of affordable housing to bring it up to a possible total of 30 percent. So they're working on that as we talk.

So this is, I mean, 119 affordable housing units in the West Loop food market. Hi, this area in the city of Chicago is a great thing. Also, the developer has been encouraged to work with minority contractors.

What we always try to encourage for the developers to do is to have their contractors to joint venture with a minority contractor. And that covers the 30 percent minority contracted. If that was to happen.

So this developer has worked with us in the past. We see no problem with those efforts and also hiring people from the community. So with that, my community supports it.

We support it. We ask for the committee support also.

[Speaker 1] (1:54:29 - 1:55:45)
Thank you so much, Mr. Burnett. Are there any other questions or comments from members? OK, so if there are no more questions or comments by committee members, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

Alderman Burnett moves do pass. Are there any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed as revised.

Thank you. Thank you. OK, sticking with Mr. Clowder, we have number 2866 in the 27th Ward ordinance referred November 17th, 2021. This is at 1300 West Carroll Avenue. This is an M two dash three light industry district to D X seven downtown mixed use district, then to a residential business plan development. We're going to incorporate some records because this item was heard and passed by the Chicago Plan Commission.

Can I have a motion to incorporate all records and findings from that hearing by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderwoman Ramirez so moves. Are there any objections?

Hearing none, the records are incorporated. Mr. Clowder.

[Speaker 7] (1:55:45 - 1:57:13)
Thank you again, Mr. Chairman for the record. Richard Clowder from the law firm of DLA Piper. My client in this instance is 1300 West Carroll owner LLC they are a single purpose entity controlled by Sterling Bay bread crawl with Sterling Bay is here with me today.

Having incorporated the plan commission record, I'll just briefly summarize the project is presented in the forum last week. The project consists of a two of a of a two building project interconnected buildings with phase one to the east, consisting of a 42 story mixed use building with office, and up to 361 dwelling units and 249 parking spaces. The second phase of the project to the to the west will be subject to future site plan approval, but would be capped at a maximum of 380 dwelling units.

This development again is very notable by virtue of the fact that it will provide 20% of the affordable units on site, or a total of 72 units in phase one alone. Phase one will also include an approximately $4.2 million bonus payment to the neighborhood opportunity fund. And the project team as always worked very closely with Alderman Burnett and the community, and had many meetings with DPD and the local community organizations.

We read and I are of course available for any questions and again thank you for your consideration, and with that we request a favorable recommendation by this committee to the full city council.

[Speaker 1] (1:57:14 - 1:57:19)
Okay, are there any questions or comments from committee members, Alderman Burnett would you like to speak on this item.

[Speaker 2] (1:57:19 - 1:57:51)
So thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. So actually this is like right down the street from the other development on the 1300 block lake 1300 block of curl. Sterling Bay has been a great developer in our community.

They work very closely with minority contractors and hiring people from the ward so we appreciate that. I don't know. So, rich counselor you didn't mention the number of affordable units.

[Speaker 7] (1:57:52 - 1:57:56)
If I didn't I'm sorry it's a 72 affordable units on site.

[Speaker 2] (1:57:57 - 1:58:12)
The 72 affordable units on site reasonably dispersed throughout the building and in proportion to the unit type right, but we're also working in coordination with you all to increase it to 30% with city subsidies right and that's under negotiation right now.

[Speaker 7] (1:58:12 - 1:58:13)
That's correct.

[Speaker 2] (1:58:13 - 2:00:15)
Okay with the Department of Housing. And also I just wanted to make a note to my colleagues here. You notice the other project gave 5.3 million to the neighborhood opportunity fund and this project is given 4.2 million to the neighborhood opportunity fund. So that's another way of saying to the invest Southwest. Right. Yeah.

So, so a lot of projects in our ward and probably in some of these other words. I would fund the neighborhood opportunity fund or to invest Southwest and all the other words so it's coming from our area to fund that but also folks need to make a note. You're not just just so folks can understand that the both of these projects contribute to our tip that's in this area which is one of the most healthiest tips in the city of Chicago, and the surplus from these tips, generally goes to help subsidize the budget during budget time so we don't have to raise taxes.

You know, when it's time for us to vote on a budget so all of these projects contribute to the rest of the city of Chicago we're very proud to play a part in that. They met with two of our local community organizations just like the last one, the West Central Association and also the neighbors are the West loop. Both organizations didn't have a challenge.

We held a community meeting with the West Central Association. We didn't have any challenges in the meeting. They went through planning design guidelines and they had a lot of input in making changes to these buildings to to fit what the community and planning, except.

So with that, there's no challenge with our community. I have no challenge I asked for the committee support. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:00:15 - 2:00:39)
Thank you so much. Alderman Burnett Are there any questions or comments on this item. All right, so if there are no more questions or comments by committee members do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum Alderman Burnett moves do pass.

Are there any objections. Hearing none, the item is passed as revised.

[Speaker 7] (2:00:40 - 2:00:41)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:00:42 - 2:00:47)
So we are now on page. Yes, Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 2] (2:00:48 - 2:01:09)
There's one more from our ward that's not right up under this. If I'm not mistaken is on the next page on page 16 document number 02023 dash seven zero. If you want to, if you would like to take it to give you all the opportunity not to hear me talk anymore, you know what I'm saying.

[Speaker 1] (2:01:09 - 2:01:14)
It is grouped with attorney Tyler manic.

[Speaker 12] (2:01:14 - 2:01:15)
Yeah.

[Speaker 1] (2:01:15 - 2:01:24)
Now if you have to leave we can I don't have to order I'm here, or if not, okay, yeah, we're going to hear you. Okay, later on. Thank you so much.

[Speaker 2] (2:01:24 - 2:01:25)
I was trying to give you a break.

[Speaker 1] (2:01:27 - 2:01:47)
Okay, so we are now on page 14 number 22144 T one in the 45th Ward ordinance referred March 15 2023. This is at 5411 West Higgins Avenue, and this is a B three dash one Community Shopping District to be three dash three Community Shopping District.

[Speaker 7] (2:01:47 - 2:03:32)
Good morning, Mr chairman and members of the committee again for the record rich cloud or from DLA Piper, we represent the applicant in this matter, National Veterans Art Museum. Just a quick bit of background companion type one applications were filed for two properties, located at 5411 West Higgins, and its neighbor 5415 West Higgins, both in the 45th Ward and both seeking to rezone the properties from B three one to be three three. Last month, the committee approved the type one application for 5415 West Higgins, that application authorized the construction of an addition to the existing two story building on the property currently home to the Ed Pashke Art Center, the property immediately to the east of 5415 West Higgins, which is 5411 West Higgins as a subject of the action being requested today.

That project had not received the full community input required by alderman Gardner. So it was, it was deferred for one meeting in order to allow him to convene a community meeting on that project that meeting was convened last week and that project received the unanimous support from his neighborhood organization. This application before you today would enable construction of a National Veterans Art Museum next door to the project that was approved last, last meeting, which was the Ed Pashke Art Center.

So this application would enable the reuse of an existing commercial building and approve an addition to allow for occupancy by the National Veterans Art Museum, as well as accessory retail and office uses. So therefore, with respect to the application with the property of 5411 West Higgins, we'd ask for a favorable recommendation of approval. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:03:33 - 2:03:44)
The committee, we have heard from alderman Gardner and he is in support of this item. Are there any questions or comments from members? Alderman Lawson, Vice Chair Lawson.

Great, great. I would encourage all of my colleagues to go. It's, it's going to be unexpected when you do, and very happy that they're having a new home right next to the Pashke Center.

It's a great arts hub on the northwest side.

[Speaker 7] (2:04:03 - 2:04:06)
Yep, exactly right. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Vice Chair.

[Speaker 1] (2:04:08 - 2:04:13)

Hearing none the substitute narrative and plans are accepted. So do we have any questions or comments for the applicants and their attorney.

Okay. Oh, Alderman La Spada.

[Speaker 13] (2:12:06 - 2:12:21)
This might be a zoning administrator, Murphy question. Administrator Murphy. How does this correspond within the plan manufacturing district.

In terms of the allowable uses.

[Speaker 11] (2:12:24 - 2:13:02)
Patrick Murphy with the Department of Planning. So this would not be within the PMD. Yes.

Okay, so it's going to going to the, you know, lesser or non manufacturing uses. We would normally want to see C3 zoning district as at least a buffer prohibits residential, usually we recommend that between industrial areas and non industrial areas, PMD or otherwise. I wouldn't say that this necessarily runs counter to that, but it's a, you know, a lesser degree of zoning that we would otherwise normally recommend for these, these type of scenarios.

[Speaker 12] (2:13:04 - 2:13:04)
Thank you.

[Speaker 19] (2:13:05 - 2:13:05)
Thank you, sir.

[Speaker 11] (2:13:06 - 2:13:07)
Esquire Dwight there.

[Speaker 19] (2:13:08 - 2:13:19)
I'd also note alderman that the. There are five two flat residentials across the street and across the alley are additional residential so it is not an island in the district.

[Speaker 12] (2:13:23 - 2:13:25)
Any other questions or comments.

[Speaker 1] (2:13:27 - 2:14:32)
Okay, if there are no more than do I have a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum alderman Vegas moves do pass. Are there any objections. Hearing none.

The item is passed. Thank you. Thank you.

We only have 15 items left. Okay, so next up we have attorney Tyler manic. And we are on page 16, this is number 22197 T one in the 32nd Ward ordinance referred May 24 2023, the common addresses 1868 to 1878 North Milwaukee Avenue.

This is a B three dash three community shopping district to be three dash three community shopping district, and we have to accept some substitute narrative and plans. So vice chair Lawson moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum, are there any objections. No objections, the substitute narrative and plans are accepted.

Mr manic.

[Speaker 16] (2:14:33 - 2:16:19)
Thank you, Mr Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Tyler manic I'm an attorney with Shane banks Kenny and Schwartz and I'm here on behalf of the applicant peerless development LLC, which owns a subject property at 1868 to 1878 North Milwaukee. I'm joined by Joe Patrick representing the applicant and test to call us from space architects.

The applicant seeks a rezoning from a B three three community shopping district to a B three three again in order to introduce new type one zoning map amendment amendment with plans. The subject property is currently a vacant lot. Previously in 2015 this parcel was rezoned to a B three three, in order to allow a six story 44 dwelling unit mixed use building.

The current proposal remains a 44 dwelling unit mixed use building but reduces the height by one story to a total five stories. The project will comply with each of the city's equitable transit oriented development design guidelines as a project as a transit serve location in close proximity to the Western CTA blue line station. The project will further comply with the city's affordable requirements ordinance by including all 20% of the arrow units on site.

The project will have 22 parking spaces and 30 3500 square feet of commercial space. Prior to filing this application the applicant work closely with alderman walks back and shared the plans and worked with the Bucktown community organization. Both alderman walk us back and VCO both support this project with the support I respectfully request this committee's favorable recommendation to pass this zoning map amendment as amended, and we'd be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (2:16:19 - 2:17:32)
Thank you. And we do have the letter from alderman wagon spec on file, are there any questions or comments. Okay, so hearing no questions or comments, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum older woman Ramirez moves do pass, are there any objections.

This is an M three dash three heavy industry district to see three dash one commercial manufacturing and employment district. We are accepting substitute narrative and plans. So vice chair Lawson moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Are there any objections. Hearing none, the substitute narrative and plans are accepted. Mr manic.

[Speaker 16] (2:17:32 - 2:18:18)

I'm here on behalf of the applicant goose island holiday pop ups LLC, who's applying to rezone the 73,000 square foot parcel bounded by Elston Magnolia LeMoyne from M three three to a C three one zoning district. Because this rezoning is incurring in the North branch industrial corridor, this project was reviewed and presented to the planning commission on June 15 2023, when it received unanimous approval.

At this time, Mr chairman respectfully asked that this committee incorporate the findings and record from the June 15 planning commission to this application.

[Speaker 1] (2:18:20 - 2:18:23)
And Mr manic you said this went before the planning commission.

[Speaker 16] (2:18:23 - 2:18:24)
Yes, last Thursday.

[Speaker 1] (2:18:25 - 2:19:13)
All right, so we will be there for incorporating the records from the client, the planning commission. This item was heard and passed by the Chicago planning commission. And I have a motion to incorporate all records and findings from that hearing by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Older woman clay so moves. Are there any objections. Hearing none.

The item is passed as revised.

[Speaker 16] (2:19:13 - 2:19:14)
Thank you, Mr chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:19:14 - 2:19:49)
Thank you so much. Okay, next up we have attorney Zubin Kamala. And this is at the bottom of page 16 number two to 166 T one in the 32nd Ward.

The ordinance was referred for 19 2023 this is a 2940 to 46 North Levitt Street. This is a m one dash two limited manufacturing business park district to see to dash to motor vehicle related commercial district. Mr Kamala.

[Speaker 14] (2:19:50 - 2:20:58)
Good morning Mr chairman, or good afternoon, and members of the committee. My name is Zubin Kamala, I'm an attorney with the law firm of sequel and Moses. I'm appearing here on behalf of the applicant cruising canines Inc.

The applicant is seeking a zoning change from an M one to district to a C to one. The applicant currently operates a duly licensed doggy daycare business, where I happen to send my dog Toby, and we met with the alderman. Early on in this project alderman Waguesback convened a community meeting, there was overwhelming support for the project.

Alderman Waguesback office has sent a letter of support to the committee. One note. When we file the application originally we filed for a C to to zoning change alderman Waguesback office asked us to amend to see to one substitute project narrative, and a substitute ordinance has been tendered to the committee.

Thank you. Happy to answer any questions and we request your favorable recommendation.

[Speaker 1] (2:20:59 - 2:21:33)
As noted by Mr Kamala we do have a substitute and a substitute narrative and plans. So, Vice Chair Lawson moves to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Are there any objections.

Hearing none, the substitute is before us, and Vice Chair Lawson also moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Are there any objections. Hearing none, the substitute narrative and plans are accepted.

[Speaker 22] (2:21:33 - 2:21:55)
So do we have any questions or comments. Alderman Villegas. Thank you, Mr Chairman.

Could the, the applicant talk a little bit more about some of the other businesses, the expansion of businesses that you're going to do with the dog doggy daycare I got excited that's not cruising. Hey nice I was envisioning something different so could you explain a little bit.

[Speaker 14] (2:21:55 - 2:22:32)
So, I'll, I'll, I'll have Miss Gordon answer if you answer that question but I just wanted to let you know that the businesses they're existing and the purpose of the zoning change will allow for outdoor activities. And so there are essentially three lots on the property to the lots have single story buildings were indoor activities take place. And then the last lot which on the north end of the project is vacant, and so there'll be a pool and, you know, track and that sort of thing.

[Speaker 12] (2:22:32 - 2:22:38)
Cool. Thank you. I appreciate it.

Thank you, Mr. Alderman La Spada.

[Speaker 13] (2:22:41 - 2:23:04)
So, appreciate what we're discussing right here I'm just noting that we're relatively close to residential uses. How are we going to control the volume in terms of audible volume of dog activity in the area I know that's been a consideration for probable locations in my ward, how does that work.

[Speaker 14] (2:23:05 - 2:23:56)
So, I, the business only operates alderman from 9am to 3pm, and the dogs are taken out in groups. So, my clients business at most has maybe 20 to 25 dogs on a daily basis, and they kind of go out and shifts. I sort of, I hate to make the comparison but sort of like preschoolers, you know, going out to the playground, you don't get a very apt comparison.

So they don't go all out all at the same time and staff is always supervising the dogs and at any given time for any particular grouping they're probably about three to four staffers out there with the dog so they're not just out there, running amok.

[Speaker 13] (2:23:56 - 2:23:59)
That's very helpful to understand. I appreciate that.

[Speaker 1] (2:23:59 - 2:24:49)
Thank you. Thank you, sir. Any other questions or comments from members.

All right, so hearing none. Do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum alderman Vegas moves do pass. Are there any objections.

Hearing none, the item is passed as substituted and revised. Thank you so much. Thank you.

Okay, we are on page 17 number two to 191 in the 37th ward. The ordinance was referred 524 23. This is a 5518 West Ohio Street.

And this is an RS three residential single unit detached house district to RM 4.5 residential multi unit district.

[Speaker 12] (2:24:49 - 2:24:59)
And do we have a Christine beach them here. Miss Christine, or Mrs Christine beach them.

[Speaker 1] (2:25:02 - 2:25:36)
Okay, so we do not have the applicant owner here to testify so we will hold that item in hopes that they'll be here by the end of the meeting. Okay, so moving on to the second item on page 17 number two to 164 T one in the 40th ward ordinance referred for 1923. This is a 2306 to 12 West Ainslie Street.

And this is an RS three residential single unit detached house district to RM five residential multi unit district. We have attorney Thomas s more here on behalf of CKG Realty Group LLC.

[Speaker 3] (2:25:37 - 2:27:16)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Thomas s more for the record. And with me today is Scott Schiller who is the developer in this case.

This, this is St. Matthias church or was for 100 years or so. And the archdiocese has closed the church. And this, this particular property.

The first one here is the former rectory which is a beautiful building. And Mr. Schiller's LLC. It wants to repurpose it as a 12 unit apartment building, and there will be three affordable units in it.

And he went through a very extensive interactive process in the 40th ward. And made changes to accommodate the neighborhoods comments, and has the ultimate support, and we'd request your support as well. The reason we went to an RM five the existing parking is, is limited, and the RM five, it is a transit served area, it's right near Western Avenue bus.

And this will allow us to have a to seek a administrative adjustment to adjust the parking. And with your. We therefore ask your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (2:27:16 - 2:27:41)
And I was remiss not to mention that this second and third item on page 17 are linked together. So we're hearing them both at once. So, again, that was number 221641 at 2306 to 12 West Ainsley Street, and number 22165 at 4900 to 4910 North Oakley Avenue.

[Speaker 3] (2:27:42 - 2:27:42)
I'm sorry.

[Speaker 1] (2:27:43 - 2:27:48)
And that is an RS three residential single unit detached house district to RM 4.5 residential multi unit district.

[Speaker 3] (2:27:49 - 2:28:46)
So then may I supplement my introduction so that's right the, the property to the east of the street. The church had room not only to repurpose and save the existing very nice build rectory building and make it into 12 units but there was also sufficient property to the east of that to build five townhouses. And as I said there was a extensive community process, where originally, there were many more units on the second property proposed, and the community supported the five townhouse says, along with the renovation of the existing 12 units in the existing rectory.

And again, we have the community support and the ultimate support we'd request your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (2:28:46 - 2:29:00)
And we have heard from Alderman Vasquez, who also informed us of his support. So are there any questions on 22164 dash t one and 22165. Alderman Dowell.

[Speaker 10] (2:29:00 - 2:29:09)
Yes, I just wanted to find out with 12 units here and five and the other one.

[Speaker 3] (2:29:09 - 2:29:45)
You know, yes, so they, they saw them as one. I mean, not. In other words, they wouldn't let him pass on.

So it's 17 units altogether. And so, it's actually 3.4 units is the 20% so he has any still discussing it with a arrow, the administrators there, whether he would buy out the point four, or how exactly he would handle that, but it the, he will meet the 20% requirement.

[Speaker 10] (2:29:45 - 2:29:51)
Okay, with some units on site. All units all units on site. Right.

Okay. Thank you.

[Speaker 12] (2:29:51 - 2:29:54)
Thank you. Thank you so much all the woman down.

[Speaker 1] (2:29:55 - 2:30:44)
Any other questions or comments on these two items from committee members. Okay, so there being no more questions or comments. Do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum for files 22164 dash t one and 22165 Alderman La Spada moves do pass, are there any objections.

Hearing none, the ordinances are passed. Thank you very much. Okay, we are moving on to page 18 number 2150 in the 47th Ward ordinance referred April 19 2023, this is at 3632 North Ashland Avenue, and this is a C one dash two neighborhood commercial district to be to dash three neighborhood mixed use district, Mr Moore.

[Speaker 3] (2:30:45 - 2:31:48)
Thank you, Mr Chairman and members of the committee. This is a property that is in building court, and in great need of renovation, and the applicant has a plan to. There's also what's probably not a legal apartment in the basement so the plan is to make it if it's currently a two unit to make it a four unit to renovate the entire building to legalize the basement apartment, and to add a unit in the attic.

And so, it would end up a four unit building, which we went through a community, we went both through a local community meeting, and the 47th Ward Zach community. And in both cases there were adjustments that were requested and made, and we have the support of Alderman Martin and we request your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (2:31:48 - 2:32:30)
We have also heard from Alderman Martin, who expressed his support. Are there any questions or comments from committee members. Seeing none.

Do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum older woman Harris moves do pass. Are there any objections. Hearing none, the item is passed.

Okay, number 22149 also in the 47th Ward ordinance referred April 19 2023. This is at 1844 West Irving Park Road. This is a B3 dash two community shopping district to be to dash three neighborhood mixed use district.

This also includes a restrictive covenant, Mr Moore.

[Speaker 3] (2:32:30 - 2:33:31)
Yes, thank you, Mr Chairman, this is a now vacant property, it was a building that had serious problems, and is now gone through a series of community meetings and interactions with the alderman. The applicant has negotiated a affordable unit on the ground floor, that would, but it doesn't qualify, because there's a total of seven units. So it doesn't qualify for the formal program so he has given 30 years at a 60% am I in a covenant and enforceable by the alderman or any, any, any really anyone interested, and the with that the alderman supports the project and we'd request your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (2:33:32 - 2:33:39)
Thank you so much, and we have heard from Alderman Martin he is in support. Alderman Espada.

[Speaker 13] (2:33:40 - 2:33:41)
Thank you so much, sir.

[Speaker 3] (2:33:41 - 2:34:31)
Tom Can you explain more about this restrictive government that we're talking, so it's a standard form that's often used by zoning lawyers here and it's been recorded, and it's, you know, it obligates the owner, and it will run with the land so if he were ever to sell the building, it will any subsequent owner would be bound by it to forever, well for 30 years, excuse me, rent the property at 60% of am I you know basically follow the same you know, same requirements as the formal program but it doesn't qualify for the formal program.

[Speaker 13] (2:34:31 - 2:34:48)
Well, it's definitely intriguing but I'm wondering if somebody can confirm. Are the parties of the covenant, the, the city and the owner the alderman and the owner can someone confirm the enforceability of what we're discussing. It.

[Speaker 3] (2:34:49 - 2:35:36)
The, the party is the 100% owner that's who has a right to encumber the property, and it says in the enforcement part that enforcement of this provision of this declaration shall be in any proceeding at law equity brought by the declarant its successors or signs, or the city of Chicago or the office of the alderman, which has jurisdiction over the property. And it goes on, but, and basically also attorneys fees are would be awarded. If you had to bring them an action to enforce it.

[Speaker 13] (2:35:36 - 2:35:47)
I won't belabor the point but Patrick may ask through the chair or by by email even the department's opinion on the enforceability of the covenant.

[Speaker 11] (2:35:48 - 2:36:47)
Patrick Murphy from the Department of Planning. Unless the city council agrees to become a signatory to whatever these agreements are these private agreements, they would not be enforceable to the degree that they run counter to whatever is required under the municipal code so if there is some action that this requires one of these parties to do that would be contrary to what's required under a zoning district that might exist there for instance then that would not be something the city can enforce upon, or cannot we can of course those terms counter to what the ordinance requires.

If city council becomes a party to one of these agreements that might change the outcome of that situation but it also might change whatever the specifics are that go into that decision. So, I could not say what the what what what all the details are I don't know what that document is, but to the degree it's not approved by city council, then it would be purely a private agreement.

[Speaker 13] (2:36:48 - 2:37:02)
Okay, and I'm fine voting based on the merits of the zoning change itself but that it feels like something that would merit a further conversation at some point outside of this chamber but I'm I'm fine making a motion to pass at this time.

[Speaker 3] (2:37:03 - 2:37:23)
But there's nothing contrary to city law here this you know this is going to be a The one apartment is going to be voluntarily, but obligated running with the land to to be affordable.

[Speaker 13] (2:37:23 - 2:37:25)
Oh, sorry.

[Speaker 11] (2:37:25 - 2:38:31)
I mean that may very well be true, but when there are in this case affordability requirements that are either beyond or separate from what is required under a row. The city does not have enforceability of that now, it being an arrow or an affordability issue it's not even a zoning issue, but we all the time are asked about additional agreements that mandate some degree of affordability either for projects that don't otherwise trigger it because of the unit count, or for a percentage of am I reduction that exceeds what's in the municipal code. None of those are able to be enforced through the rules that we have to enforce if there's a private agreement that's in place that's completely between whichever parties, it is that sign it.

And if there's an alderman that signs it that is no longer it's no longer in their ward or they're no longer in office, then I that would also undercut the degree of enforceability, if that elected official even has the authority to sign that on behalf of the city.

[Speaker 3] (2:38:31 - 2:38:42)
But no alderman signed this the 100% owner has obligated himself to whoever the alderman is in the area whenever for 30 years.

[Speaker 11] (2:38:43 - 2:39:09)
That's fine. I'm just saying that, absent it being something approved by city council that significantly diminishes the ability to enforce whatever the agreement is mine or otherwise by the city, you're saying, correct, that's what that was, yes, correct. So if you want the enforceability would be through private means that the two parties involved would have to take up on their own.

That's if there may even be an arbitration clause within this agreement that mandates how it gets settled. All right.

[Speaker 1] (2:39:11 - 2:39:50)
Thank you so much. Sorry for that. No worries.

So are there any other questions or comments. Okay, so hearing no more questions or comments by committee members do I hear motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum alderman Vegas moves to pass. Are there any objections.

Hearing none. The item is passed. Okay, moving on to number 22174 in the 48th ward ordinance referred for 1923.

This is a 5943 to 59 North Broadway, and this is a C one dash three neighborhood commercial district to be three dash three community shopping district. Mr. Moore.

[Speaker 3] (2:39:50 - 2:40:58)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, this is a someone, the owner, keeping a promise made a few years ago, this property was zoned to see to allow a special wine store to move in as a tenant. At the time with the community meetings and father father alderman Osterman, a promise was made to zone it back to be once all the licenses were obtained. Time went by.

And that didn't happen. As alderman Osterman near the end of his term he said hey what about this, and the owner, who always intended to keep his word file this but timing wise, we ended up with the new alderman the new alderman has been apprised of this and is supporting this. Keeping of the promise to zone it back to be.

[Speaker 1] (2:40:59 - 2:41:21)
Okay. Any questions or comments from committee members. All right, we have heard from all the women manna Hoppenworth, she is in support, and we have a motion from alderman Burnett to do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine forum.

Are there any objections. Hearing none, the item is passed.

[Speaker 3] (2:41:21 - 2:41:22)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (2:41:22 - 2:41:50)
Thank you so much. Okay, we are on page 19. This is number 22182 in the 44th Ward ordinance referred 524 23.

This is at 3537 North Racine Avenue. This is an arm 4.5 residential multi unit district to RT for residential two flat townhouse and multi unit district, and we have attorney Warren silver, Mr. Thank you, Mr. Chairman members of the committee.

[Speaker 26] (2:41:50 - 2:43:24)
For the record, Warren silver silver law office PC representing Gregory Davey and his wife Sarah Whaley Davey. Very quickly, this is a situation where our clients. The applicants purchased condominium unit from a developer, and later discovered when they tried to get a building permit for some further improvements that the developer had built the property, slightly larger than was permitted in the zoning district.

And, you know, as a consequence, the property was rezoned in January of 22, in order to render the property conforming. And to allow them to get the permit for their contemplated further improvements. It was reason RM 4.5. At that time, and they committed to alderman Tony, that they would rezone back to the pre existing RT for after everything was done, and that's what we're here for today. We work very closely with alderman Tony's office, and in particular with alderman Lawson, in his capacity as chief of staff for alderman Tony and in his new capacity as alderman of the 44th ward himself. We're grateful for his support throughout the process. And we asked the committee for a favorable determination.

[Speaker 1] (2:43:26 - 2:44:13)
Thank you so much. Are there any questions or comments. Okay, so if there are no questions or comments by committee members do I hear a motion do pass by the same role call that was used to determine forum by share loss and moves do pass.

Are there any objections. Hearing none, the item is passed very much. Okay, so next up we have attorney Liz Butler taft.

This is number two to 043 T one in the second ward ordinance referred 1214 22. This is a 1032 1050 West North Avenue slash 1604 to 1624 North Kingsbury Street. And this is a business plan development number 884 to see one dash five neighborhood commercial district Esquire Butler tax.

[Speaker 21] (2:44:14 - 2:46:01)
Good afternoon, Mr Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Liz Butler I'm a partner at the law firm of tax detainees and Hollister we're located at 111 East Wacker Drive in Chicago. I represent the applicant in this matter, LSD of Lincoln Park, LLC, and I'm joined today by Brian Sheehan who is the senior vice president of LLC development here on behalf of the applicant.

The applicant is requesting a rezoning of the subject property, generally located at 1030 West North Avenue from the business plan development number 844 to the C one five neighborhood commercial district, we are proposing to sunset the PD. The subject property consists of an existing four story building that currently operates as a self storage facility. The applicant acquired the building in 2012.

At that time, there was a an off premises wall sign located at the building which has since been removed the change requests will allow the off premises wall sign to be reestablished no other improvements or physical changes to the property are proposed. So, as a matter of policy. And as a matter of law, off premises signs are not allowed within plan developments.

This plan development is is fully built, built out. We're proposing this as a type one zoning change so no new improvements would be permitted this would simply allow the reestablishment of the off premises wall sign. The change request to the C one five is because the C one five is zoning classification that immediately preceded the establishment of the plan development so we're proposing to sunset to the zoning classification that preceded the PD.

[Speaker 1] (2:46:04 - 2:46:08)
Thank you so much. Are there any questions or comments on this item.

[Speaker 21] (2:46:09 - 2:46:17)
Chairman, if I could. We discussed the matter with alderman Hopkins and provided a letter of support to the committee in advance of the hearing.

[Speaker 12] (2:46:18 - 2:46:22)
Thank you so much. Alderman Hopkins.

[Speaker 1] (2:46:23 - 2:46:42)
Just want to see if maybe you want to say something virtually. Okay. Are there any other questions or comments.

So, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum older woman Fuentes moves do pass. Are there any objections. Hearing none, the item is passed.

[Speaker 21] (2:46:43 - 2:46:43)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:46:44 - 2:47:59)
Okay, so now we are going back to attorney Steve Friedland, and we're going to hear both the item on page 19, and then after that we're going to go back to the item in the third ward on page two. And we'll have separate motions for that but just want to make sure we're clear on that. Wonderful.

And so the presentations that I may pass out are going to be for the item in the third ward on page two, but first we're going to hear the item on page 19. So this is number 22070 in the 16th ward ordinance referred January 18 2023. This is at 6206 South racing Avenue, and this is an RS three residential single unit detached house district to be to dash to neighborhood mixed use district, and then to a plan development.

This was before the Chicago Plan Commission so we do have to incorporate some records. The item was heard and passed by the Chicago Plan Commission. Can I have a motion to incorporate all records and findings from that hearing by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum alderman Conway so moves.

Are there any objections. Hearing none, the records are incorporated. Mr Friedland.

[Speaker 5] (2:48:00 - 2:49:57)
Thank you, Mr Chairman again Steve Friedland with the law firm of Applegate Thorne Thompson here on behalf of the project team for this plan development, the go green team is made up of a number of not for profit organizations including the inner city Muslim Action Network, the resident Association of greater Englewood teamwork Englewood and eg would, and also their development partner, the Gorman company. I have with me Carl rapper who was with our architect Nia architects, as you indicated this was before the plan commission.

This is the site of the old wood school which closed somewhere around 2013. And since that time, this community based group of organizations has been working to try to redevelop that school. And that's what's before you today, the materials that Nicole is handing out there actually is also a set of materials for the regenerator project as well so, which is what this is called so there, there are some drawings there for the members to look at this school is currently a three story school, and the proposal is to put one more story on the school so it'll be a four story development.

It will have 48 affordable housing units, 100% of them will be affordable. And on the first floor there will be a federally qualified health center. So this is a really wonderful redevelopment that has taken a long time for all of these community actors to redevelop Alderman Coleman, excuse me, provider her support at the plan commission I believe that the committee has a copy of that as well.

And with that we would take any questions you might have.

[Speaker 1] (2:49:58 - 2:51:05)
And yes, we do have Alderman Coleman's letter on file and support. Are there any questions or comments. Okay, so hearing none.

Do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Other women doubt moves do pass. Are there any objections.

Hearing none, the item is passed as revised. So, we are going back to page two. And this is number 21125 in the third ward.

This is ordinance referred 921 22. The common addresses 45 to 79 East 18th Street, 1801 to 1809 South Wabash 1800 to 1806 South Michigan Avenue. And this is a DX dash five downtown mixed use district and dr dash three downtown residential district to a dr dash five downtown residential district, then to a residential plan development, and the copies that you have received are related to this project.

Mr Friedland.

[Speaker 5] (2:51:05 - 2:53:16)
Thank you very much, Steve Friedland with Applegate Thornton Thompson, on behalf of mercy housing. I really do want to apologize to the committee members, especially to Nicole for me getting those materials to her late, which I know has ruined her day. But hopefully you have them before you right now and alderman doll.

I'm glad that she asked us to present them because what this is, is a redevelopment of an existing SRO building, which is at Wabash and 18th Street. And the way that mercy is able to do this is, they're going to rehabilitate that building an existing six story building with 100 units of affordable housing, all affordable. Those will be efficiency units.

And then they're also going to build on an adjacent. Currently it's a parking lot with a new 50 unit five story building at Michigan and 18. And both of those buildings, which there are three drawings or three exhibits that were presented to all of you, and you'll see both buildings next to each other in those exhibits.

What this will do is create 150 units of affordable housing in the downtown area, which, you know, mercy housing. I think I said it earlier, but I'll say it again, is a not for profit developer of affordable housing, it's one of the nation's largest affordable housing developers. And this really will solidify some affordable housing in this location for a very long time, you know, next 30 to 40 years.

I do want to state again just for the record because we're going up here again that I have Todd Walcott from mercy housing and Yvonne Harleston from our architects and the architects here, and we would certainly be willing to take any questions from the committee.

[Speaker 1] (2:53:19 - 2:53:23)
Thank you so much. Do we have questions or comments from committee members.

[Speaker 19] (2:53:23 - 2:53:40)
I do. Thank you. All the woman clay.

Thank you, Chairman. Thank you so much for reporting back on this I just wanted to clarify because we have seen that mercy housing is going through some receivership or remind me if I am speaking about a different corporation.

[Speaker 5] (2:53:42 - 2:53:44)
Yeah, I, I believe, I believe you're.

[Speaker 19] (2:53:45 - 2:53:50)
Okay, just wanted to make sure that there was no coming link. That's all I wanted. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:53:55 - 2:53:56)
Thank you so much.

[Speaker 12] (2:53:57 - 2:53:59)
Thank you, sir. Just out of curiosity.

[Speaker 13] (2:53:59 - 2:54:09)
I think I remember right this is the same property where we had that 2021 Department of Housing funding announcement. I thought so.

[Speaker 12] (2:54:10 - 2:54:26)
A really beautiful project I was I was glad to hear about it, then and I'm so glad that we're doing the zoning amendment for it now, that's really really exciting work. Thank you. All the woman down.

[Speaker 10] (2:54:27 - 2:55:28)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for Mr Freeland and group for being flexible to be able to present this this afternoon. I thought it was important that we do a presentation because, you know, we're always looking at how to increase the supply of affordable housing in our city. And this is an important project that does so in the midst of a community where there's been tremendous growth in the south loop.

Just want to give people context immediately across the street on Wabash is a market rate development that would be coming up and these units sit in the middle of, you know, as I mentioned a very vibrant and diverse community, and really asking for your support. As we move forward on the zoning matter. Thank you, Mr Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (2:55:30 - 2:55:52)
Thank you. And this seems like a great project so kudos to all the women and everyone involved. There any other questions or comments from committee members.

All right, so do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. All the woman down moves do pass. Are there any objections.

All right, hearing none, the item is passed.

[Speaker 10] (2:55:52 - 2:55:53)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (2:55:55 - 2:55:56)
Yes, all the woman down.

[Speaker 10] (2:55:58 - 2:56:18)
Also acknowledge. Anthony Akin deli, who is the architect on this project, he did a phenomenal job and even though these pictures don't really show the quality of the work and I just wanted to this since you came down. I wanted to take the time to acknowledge that today.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:56:19 - 2:58:14)
Thank you so much. So, we are coming up to the last page of the agenda. But before we do I just want to see is Christine beach them here.

This was for the item on page 17 so we're going to do the last items on page 20. And if you are not here then we're going to defer your item. Okay.

All right, so on to page 20 number two to 104, and number two to 103 we're going to hear these two items together. I will read them into the record. The attorney Ed costs is going to make one presentation and we will take a motion for each after its conclusion.

So this is number two to 104 in the 34th Ward ordinance referred March 15 2023. The common addresses 320 North Jefferson 650 West women 740 West Fulton market and 331 North hosted, and this is plan development number 643 as amended to plan development number 643 as amended. And then we're also hearing this with number 22103 in the 27th Ward.

This is ordinance, this ordinance was referred on March 15 2023. The common address is 357 to 359 North Green Street. And this is an M two dash three light industry district and dx dash seven downtown mixed use district to dx dash seven downtown mixed use district, then to a plan development.

So, as a matter of housekeeping, both of these items were heard and passed by the Chicago Planning Commission, and at this time Vice Chairman Lawson motions to incorporate the record of files, number two to 104 and two to 103 by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum, are there any objections. Hearing none, the records are incorporated. Mr costs you may proceed.

[Speaker 8] (2:58:14 - 2:59:32)
Thank you, Mr Chairman. Good afternoon, Mr Chairman and members of the committee. The record My name is Ed costs and attorney with the taft law firm, located at 111 East Wacker in Chicago.

As you noted both items should be heard together because they are part of the same project. With respect to the item number 22104 plan development 643. This was an old plan development that contains five sub areas, a through e.

The applicant in this case on a 357 North Green LLC is the owner of sub area e, which is actually located in the 27th Ward. And that is a parcel that's being combined with the other 27th Ward development in the next matter. But the parcel being removed to adjust the boundaries is in the 27th Ward.

The remaining sub areas a through d are located east of Halston Street and are indeed in the 34th Ward. But there is no change taking place to those other than shifting the boundary line of plan development 643 from west of Halston Street to east of Halston Street to encapsulate sub areas a through d as opposed to sub area e. And again, sub area e will be removed.

Any questions with respect to that?

[Speaker 1] (2:59:36 - 2:59:39)
Alderman Burnett or Alderman Conway, would you like to speak on this item?

[Speaker 25] (2:59:40 - 2:59:54)
I'm happy to speak. Yeah, I certainly support this change. You know, it's really for the developments in the 27th Ward and this will they would have to come back to amend the PD to develop the rest of the partners in my ward.

So I, I certainly support this.

[Speaker 2] (2:59:56 - 3:01:44)
Yeah, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Alderman. You know, that used to be my ward.

You inherited some good stuff, you know, just just as a history lesson. 740 West Fulton Street was my first affordable housing mixed use development has 10 percent affordable housing in that building. And of course, it was done when there was no A.R.O. So this is over over 20 something years ago. I was encouraging affordable housing in this area. So they got 10 percent affordable in that building. Quite as is kept.

Matter of fact, the funny thing is I had a community meeting and people were complaining and four people was there. And I was like, this is an affordable. This is my first building that I had affordable housing built.

So the the it was a white lady, a white guy, a Latino lady and a black guy. Both of the white people say, yeah, I got an affordable unit. The Latino person, an African-American person like, how you get an affordable unit?

I didn't get one. So it's an interesting building and I'm very proud of it. You never would know that affordable housing was in that building.

That was over 20 something years ago. But anyway. This is a very nice development.

They went through all the community organizations, West Central Association and the neighbors of the West Loop. We had a community meeting. One of the things that we did try to encourage.

This isn't a residential building. This is actually a office building. They if you can turn the slats to the to the open space.

Who has the. She had a thing to turn the slats. Turn the slats to the open space.

[Speaker 15] (3:01:44 - 3:01:49)
I don't know. It's just the renderings of the building didn't show the open space.

[Speaker 2] (3:01:51 - 3:02:58)
OK, well, they have a beautiful best of view where you can walk through the building. Open space is open for the public is very nice and beautiful. It's another addition to the market.

Also, one of the things that we encourage with this development, as we do with some of the other developments in the area, because we have a robust community over here at this time, there's a lot of traffic. We ask that they allow for some of their parking to go to a public parking. So we ask that.

Also, one of the things that we ask, Mr. Chairman, is that this developer and in this building, consider working with the unions in terms of doorman and stuff like that. In regards to their development, we encourage them to sit down and work that out. We can't make them do anything, but we encourage them to do that.

And they concur that they will. So with that, Mr. Chairman, we ask for the committee's support. My community support it.

We support it. We ask for the committee's support.

[Speaker 8] (3:02:59 - 3:04:26)
Mr. Chairman. Yes, Mr. Chairman, if I may. First, I was remiss in not introducing Mr. Paul Pirro, the director of development for the applicant. And second of all, I thought we're going to come back to this because I neglected to give you the basic facts of this building. If I may do that very briefly. This parcel, there's two parcels here.

Again, sub area E was transferred over. Both parcels are currently vacant. The site is about 60,000 square feet.

This will be a 30 story office tower with ground floor commercial and office above it. And there is over 7000 square feet of open space at the plaza level, which will be open to the public and open during park district hours, 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. There will be, as Alderman Burnett mentioned, about 300 parking spaces. While the parking will, of course, be reserved for the tenants of the building on first come, first come basis.

There is an opportunity to provide some public parking in the area, which many neighbors have suggested to the applicant to provide because it's just getting very tight over there. And again, this will be going from M23 on the north parcel, PD643 on the south to a DX7 and then to a business plan development. And we are taking advantage of the F.A.R. bonus payment, which will contribute just over six point two million dollars to the city's fund. With that, we're happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (3:04:27 - 3:04:33)
Are there any other questions or comments from committee members? On these two items, Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 8] (3:04:33 - 3:04:34)
Yeah, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 2] (3:04:35 - 3:04:39)
So. How much money is going to the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund?

[Speaker 8] (3:04:40 - 3:04:41)
Just over six point two million dollars.

[Speaker 2] (3:04:41 - 3:04:49)
So the six, that's the bonus. OK, six point two. Which goes into the invest southwest.

Thank you so much.

[Speaker 1] (3:04:50 - 3:06:37)
And I just want to echo Alderman Burnett's sentiments. Thank you for agreeing to sit down with SCIU Local 1. I was at the Planning Commission meeting when we voted to advance this.

And I certainly hope that you keep that commitment to sit down with the union and speaking with them. So if there are no more questions or comments on this item. Thank you, Mr. Cuss. If there are no more questions by committee members. Do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum for files two to one oh four and two to one oh three. Alderman Burnett moves do pass.

Any objections? Hearing none, the ordinances are passed as revised. Thank you.

Thank you. OK, so before we hear the. Oh, well, we'll just stick with Mr. Cuss in the 28th Ward. So this is the last item on page 20. Right after that, we will go to Christine Beecham. And then we will motion to defer some items where no one was here to testify.

So, I'm on page 20 number two two oh three three in the 28th Ward ordinance referred 1214 22. This is 441 North Kilboard Avenue slash 4239 West Ferdinand Street. This is a plan manufacturing district number nine to a plan development.

We have to incorporate some records here. So this item was heard and passed by the Chicago Planning Commission. Can I have a motion to incorporate all records and findings from that hearing by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum?

Alderman Lawson so moves. Are there any objections? Hearing none.

The records are incorporated. Mr. Cuss.

[Speaker 8] (3:06:37 - 3:08:08)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Again, for the record, my name is Ed Cuss, an attorney with the Taft Law Firm located at 111 East Wacker Drive in Chicago. I'm pleased to be here this afternoon on behalf of Capital Realty LLC, which is the applicant for the project.

Joining me this afternoon is Mr. Alberto Lando with the applicant's team. This property consists of about 13 and a half acres. There is currently an existing warehouse on site of about two hundred and ninety thousand square feet.

This proposed zoning change would allow, in addition to that warehouse of about eighty one thousand square feet. And again, we are rezoning the property from PMD nine to the industrial plan development. The site is currently operated by Chicago Beverage Systems, and they've been there since about 1983.

Chicago Beverage Systems is an affiliate of Reyes Beverage Systems, which, fun fact, is the largest beer distributor in the United States. They distribute about 278 million cases of beer throughout the United States annually. So there's a lot of beer distribution there.

Current operation has about 300 current employees that work at staggered times. The new addition would allow for 20 new employees to be added. And this would be about a 20 million dollar addition in terms of cost to the property.

With that, Mr. Chairman, we would ask you to answer any questions and request your favorable approval.

[Speaker 1] (3:08:09 - 3:08:54)
The committee has heard from Alderman Irvin, who has expressed his support. Are there any questions or comments on this item? All right.

If there are no questions or comments, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderman Burnett moves do pass. Are there any objections?

Hearing none. The item is passed as revised. Thank you so much.

So now we are going back to page 17. We have Miss Christine Beacham here. She is the owner and applicant representing herself for number 22191 in the 37th Ward Ordinance Referred 52423.

This is an RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RM 4.5 residential multi unit district.

[Speaker 15] (3:08:54 - 3:09:22)
Mrs. Beacham or Miss Beacham. Hi, Christine Beacham. So we have a property at 5518 West Ohio.

So we would like to have the opportunity to change the zoning from our RS3 to our RM 4.5, where we will build a four story four dwelling unit. The measuring for the residential be approximately 4040 by 48 with three paved on site parking spot parking lot in the back.

[Speaker 1] (3:09:22 - 3:11:12)
Thank you. And we have heard from Alderwoman Mitts, who is in support of this item. Are there any questions or comments from committee members?

All right. There being no questions or comments, do I hear a motion do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum? Alderwoman Fuentes moves do pass.

Are there any objections? Hearing none. The item is passed.

Thank you so much. Last, we'll be going back to page one. We did not hear.

No one was here from Alderman Curtis's office so we'll be holding these three items. This is number eight eight eight to six at 3245 to 3321 West Columbus Avenue. Number eight eight eight to seven at 3323 to 3745 West Columbus Avenue.

And this is number eight eight eight to eight at 8658 South Pulaski Road and 3841 to 3987 West Columbus Avenue. So are there any questions from committee members? If there are no questions, Vice Chair Lawson makes a motion to defer the previously read items by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Are there any objections? Hearing none. The items are deferred.

So that brings us to the end of our business. I just want to note that we are all caught up with introductions from April and May. So this was double the items that we would normally hear.

So, and we are just under three hours. So hopefully the next meeting will only be an hour and a half. I want to thank you all so much.

And just as a reminder, the Budget Committee will be meeting here at 2pm.

[Speaker 27] (3:11:13 - 3:11:22)
So if there are no more further items is there a motion to adjourn a well run meeting Mr Chairman I commend you for it and I'm proud to move adjournment of your first meeting.

[Speaker 1] (3:11:22 - 3:11:28)
All right, we have multiple motions to adjourn from Hopkins, Lawson, and Fuentes.

[Speaker 12] (3:11:29 - 3:11:33)
All in favor. Opposed. All right, this meeting is adjourned.
