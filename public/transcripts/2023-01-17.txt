Okay. All right. Thank you.

All right. Any questions by committee members?

[Speaker 1] (11:18 - 11:34)
Alderman Sawyer makes a motion to defer the previously listed items by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing no objections, these items have been deferred.

We have been joined by Alderman Ciccio Lopez, Alderman Riley.

[Speaker 4] (11:35 - 11:40)
No, I called her. Okay. So, how many public speakers we have today?

[Speaker 1] (11:43 - 11:58)
We have five public speakers sign up for today's hearing. We'll hear from them now. And our first one is Martin Tangora.

Step up to the mic. Identify yourself. And we have three minutes for each speaker.

[Speaker 22] (11:59 - 12:01)
I have copies of my statement, if you want.

[Speaker 1] (12:01 - 12:15)
Okay. If you want to get copies, we can receive them. But let's start your testimony.

Wait a second. Let's get this. Let's, so each member has, we'll get the, we'll get the, your written testimony.

So it's in front of us.

[Speaker 22] (12:15 - 12:16)
Shall I go ahead?

[Speaker 49] (12:16 - 12:19)
No, no. Raymond, get that and we'll start.

[Speaker 4] (12:32 - 12:35)
Okay. So we'll be passing them out, but you can proceed. Thank you.

[Speaker 22] (12:35 - 14:57)
Thank you. My name is Martin Tangora. My family owns and occupies the property at 4636 North Magnolia, next door to the subject property.

Alderman Kappelman has always argued that the advantage for a community group to approve an up zone is that it gives an opportunity to negotiate with the developer about the new building. In this case, Magnolia Malden neighbors, the local block club specified five concerns. The developers replied by agreeing to one of the five points and denying the other four.

Instead of arranging a negotiation, the alderman immediately accepted the developer's response. Since then, another concern has arisen. There has been a change in the plans, at least one change.

We believe that this change violates the building code and creates unsafe conditions. Specifically, fireplaces and chimneys have been added to the plans. There would be a chimney on each side of the proposed six flat serving several fireplaces.

The chimneys can be seen on the plans, but the elevations show no chimneys rising above the roof parapet. I would urge this committee not to approve for a type one zoning change, any plans containing last minute changes that create unsafe conditions and violate the building code. I would suggest that the matter be referred back to the applicant and the architect for revision to bring the project into compliance.

The problem is the chimneys do not satisfy the well-known three to 10 rule. In particular, the chimneys do not rise two feet above the nearest part of the building. This is section 2113.9 of the international building code and also of the Chicago code. The proposed new building has a roof deck open to its tenants and the chimneys rise exactly the height of the parapet so that anybody on the roof deck could walk over and sit on top of the chimney. It is unsafe to anyone standing near the parapet to have chimneys disgorging flame and ash at the waist high top of the parapet. As the homeowner next door, we point out this is also a hazard for our 118-year-old wood house which is less than 10 feet from the south chimney.

We think these plans are being rushed through while the present alderman is still in office lest a new alderman encourage an actual negotiation between the applicant and the neighbors.

[Speaker 1] (14:59 - 15:13)
Thank you, sir. We will hear from the alderman when we have this application. You're welcome to stay.

And I think that's it right now. All right, George Blakemore, Mr. George Blakemore.

[Speaker 16] (15:15 - 18:14)
This is another dog and pony show that applicants, number one, the aldermen should not have any power. The people who live in the area should be able to make that decision. The aldermen, it's pay to play.

All over this city, they have re-owned property that was illegal. How can they do that, Mr. Blakemore? It's called pay to play.

What? Pay to play. Some of them are fire hazards.

All types of violations, pay to play. Number one, that power should not be left up to the aldermen. The people, people power in that warren, if they don't want it, it shouldn't pass.

So why would you ask? Let me see what the aldermen have to say. And you are part of the problem.

You're not running either. You remember the old zoning. I was able to speak on all these items.

You decided, now, we're going to stop Mr. Blakemore. And we're going to let him only speak three minutes on all these items. Aren't I or ain't I one of these birds entitled to speak on them all?

Since I am a citizen, I'm supposed to be a citizen. And on these next items, if I object in any of these items, in any of these wars, you're supposed to listen to me. Who do you think you are or who do you think I am?

I didn't come down here all painted up to see you. I came down here for you political hacks to see me, to hear me. So it's waste, fraud, and abuse here.

You know why it's going on? Because of poor citizen participation. And it's exactly the black citizen.

Where are they? Yesterday was Dr. Martin Luther King's birthday. He protested.

It wasn't because he got the Nobel Peace Prize or he's a good writer or eloquent speaker. Because he saw injustice. And he got out and protested.

So you get the government you deserve. And you deserve the government you get. And all of y'all can't care.

Mr. George Blakemore filled in the other. Can't care shit.

[Speaker 49] (18:14 - 18:18)
And that's where I sit down. Beep, beep, beep, beep.

[Speaker 4] (18:20 - 18:55)
Let the record know we've been joined by Alderman Beal. Our next speaker is Michael S-N-I-E-G. Come on up, please.

Well, I'm Michael Snape. I live on 3308 North Oriole.

[Speaker 21] (18:55 - 21:19)
My family's been in that neighborhood from the 1930s. I'm opposing the zoning for 3339 Ottawa. That's the same block I live on.

We're basically a single family and not apartments in the middle of the block. There's a couple of them that were put in in the 1960s and 70s. But I'm opposing it.

It's like high-density rental condos, all that. I would like to say, please keep the neighborhood single-family units. Supposedly the contractor that's buying the house said that his mother was going to live there, and that's why they want it multifamily.

But I don't know. I don't really see that. I would see that it would be rental properties in the neighborhood.

And it's just like it's high-density now in parking and all that. And it's one of the last single-family areas of Chicago. Most of Chicago is fairly apartments and high-density.

I would like to keep it single-family. If the man said that his mother's moving in there, well, that's wonderful. I took care of my mom right next door.

And if they want their family and their mothers and grandmother can move in there, that's wonderful. But, please, I don't want it zoned for rental in the middle of the block. And I had other letters from other neighbors that opposed that also.

It's basically all single families. Like I said, my family was there from the 1930s, and I grew up in that neighborhood. And I don't really want rental in the middle of the blocks or condos or apartments.

It would be nice there on Addison and Belmont and on the main streets and the other old buildings that are grandfathered in. They started to build apartments back in the 1960s, and then they put a stop to it in the 60s and 70s. So I oppose it.

Please keep it single-family in the neighborhood.

[Speaker 1] (21:19 - 21:24)
Thank you for coming down. Is Jane with you?

[Speaker 4] (21:24 - 21:33)
Yes. Jane, would you like to add to that conversation? Yes.

My name is Jane Snead.

[Speaker 43] (21:33 - 22:45)
I live at 3310 North Oriole. I've lived here all my life. I want to keep this a single-family area.

I do not want apartment buildings and multifamily dwellings in this area. I don't believe it's right. We do not need high density.

This house at 3339 Ottawa, I know that girl. She's third grade. She lived there.

My best friend, I still see her. I know the realtor who sold that house when her mom died. And if somebody wants to live there and take care of their mom, her sister lived there and took care of her mom.

You do not need apartment buildings and multifamily dwellings. It's a single-family neighborhood. It should remain that way.

And no one in the area wants it. And I don't believe it's right to do that. And there's a lot of little homes in that area.

And if one gets in, then they're going to start changing the whole neighborhood, I believe, which I don't want at all. So please keep it a single family neighborhood.

[Speaker 1] (22:46 - 22:56)
Thank you. Appreciate both of you coming down. Thank you.

It'll be later in this agenda. All right. Our final speaker is Kathleen and Laura Girardi.

[Speaker 4] (22:59 - 23:00)
Where are we at?

[Speaker 46] (23:16 - 23:25)
Hello. I'm representing myself and my mother. We have lived at four or five to North artesian for 63 years.

There are seven houses.

[Speaker 1] (23:26 - 23:29)
And you are just so my name is Laura. Okay.

[Speaker 46] (23:29 - 24:22)
I have. There are seven houses on that block of four, five, two, four, six, six of those seven houses for our already. More than one family living in it.

There are two unit or three unit buildings. Three of those houses are single family units. I'm sorry, houses.

So my question is if this is rezoned, what does that do for the single family homes? Does that affect us at all? And if it will affect us, then I don't see a need for any kind of a zone change.

Because we already have multi units. Homes in that. On that block.

That's really all I have to say is that I don't know if I oppose it or not, because. I need to know how it's going to affect the single family home. That's my question.

[Speaker 1] (24:22 - 24:32)
All right. Mr. Gerardi, we are, first of all, thank you for coming down. Secondly, that is up very early in the agenda.

So stay tuned.

[Speaker 5] (24:32 - 24:33)
Okay. Thank you, sir.

[Speaker 1] (24:34 - 25:29)
All right. That concludes the public comment period. I believe.

We'll we'll start off with the addendum to the agenda. We have three appointments today, one designation and two reappointments. We will start with appointment number.

0 2 0 2 2 dash one 66. The designation of Brian H Sanchez. As chair and continuing member of the zoning board of appeals.

To be served concurrent with his current term as a member effective immediately. Everyone should have received a copy of Mr. Sanchez's resume electronically. And in the packet before you also Nicole, we have them in the packet.

Nicole. Mr. Sanchez's resume is in the pack. Okay, great.

And we have Mr. Sanchez here to speak on the matter. So, and answer any questions.

[Speaker 12] (25:29 - 28:10)
So good morning. Good morning. First of all, for serving on the board of appeals.

So tell me why you should be the chairman. Good morning, chairman Tunney and members of the committee. My name is Brian Sanchez.

My pronouns are he, him, his, and I come before you today, seeking confirmation of my appointment as chairman of the zoning board of appeals. It has been a little more than two years since I last came before this committee. And was privileged to be confirmed as a member of the ZBA.

I want to talk a little bit about my time on the board so far, but first allow me to reintroduce myself to the committee with a little bit of my background. I obtained my bachelor's degree in political science from the university of Illinois. And my law degree from DePaul university college of law.

During law school. I interned for the first ward office under former alderman Manny Flores. Since graduating from law school, I have focused my legal practice on civil defense litigation and appeals.

I'm currently a partner at the law firm of Sanchez Danielson Hoffman. One of the largest minority owned law firms in the city of Chicago. When I was appointed as a member of the zoning board of appeals in 2020, I took it upon myself to become better educated on the zoning ordinance and particularly the standards for variations and special uses.

Over the last two plus years on a monthly basis, I've heard the applicants and the voices of the communities in which variations or special uses are sought. Sometimes the voices are in support and sometimes an objection. Sometimes the voices of an individual, sometimes a community group, and sometimes an alder person speaking on behalf of their community.

As a board, we have welcomed the input because every ward has its own characteristics and the more input the board has, the easier it is for the board to understand the project and make an informed decision. Over the course of the last two plus years with the former chairman, now alderman, Timmy Knudson at the helm, the board has strived to conduct its hearings in a way that makes us accessible, whether the applicant is represented by an attorney or not. I intend to continue that practice to ensure that all are treated fairly before us.

Looking to the future, it is my plan to continue to evaluate the board's forms to look for ways to better streamline the processes for the applicants and the community input while ensuring the board has what it needs to render a decision. On a personal note, I've had the privilege to live in the city of Chicago for the last 20 years. I live in the first ward with my wife and my nine-year-old daughter.

Serving as a member of the zoning board of appeals has been an honor and an education. If confirmed as chairman, I look forward to working with all of you to make this city a better place for all of its residents. I thank you and I welcome any questions from the committee.

[Speaker 1] (28:11 - 28:16)
Thank you, Mr. Sanchez. I think alderman Mike Rodriguez wants to speak on this.

[Speaker 4] (28:17 - 28:18)
I think this is an excellent appointment.

[Speaker 3] (28:19 - 28:39)
I just wanted to rise and congratulate you on the appointment. Wish you good luck. Any graduate of the pause a friend of mine.

So thank you so very much for your service. I know it's tough at times. It's really tough, but I, I, I think you've got a good gut on you and you make good decisions.

So I just wanted to welcome this appointment and welcome you on as a chair.

[Speaker 4] (28:40 - 28:43)
Thank you. Alderman Cardona.

[Speaker 38] (28:44 - 29:04)
Good chairman. Just want to say congratulations. Good luck.

Disappointments outstanding, especially having a Latino. In that position. You're going to be working long hours.

So be prepared. I know you do the right thing and do the right thing for the city. Thank you.

Thank you.

[Speaker 4] (29:05 - 29:08)
All right. Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 6] (29:09 - 29:40)
Thank you. Also like to congratulate you and congratulate the mayor on this appointment. Just just want to make sure you cognizant of the fact that periodically, some of us have to come to ZBA on behalf of our constituents.

You know, folks have challenges sometimes when things are built right next door to them. So if, and when we do come, it would be solely on behalf of our constituents. So just want you to keep that in mind.

[Speaker 12] (29:41 - 29:49)
I appreciate it. Every time you were, or any of the other other older people or persons from their staff come, it does make it easier for us. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (29:49 - 29:52)
All right. Any other questions, comments? David Moore.

[Speaker 29] (29:54 - 30:33)
Thank you chairman. Again, thank you for reaching out. I truly appreciate it.

Appreciate the conversation that we had just. Some of the discussions that chairman Burnett just spoke about. We spoke about.

And it's, it's definitely, like I said, when we were, we were on the phone that if we don't want something, it's not because we as Alderman are looking to stop something. It's because we've had conversation with our constituents. It's an important that their voices be heard and you've committed to that.

And I appreciate that so much. So I support this recommendation and a move do pass on it. Right.

[Speaker 1] (30:33 - 31:25)
No other hands Alderman David Moore moves do pass on this selection of Mr. Sanchez as the chair. Any objections hearing none. The appointment is passed and good luck to you.

Thank you. All right. Next.

Next we have document number zero, or I'm sorry, a two, zero to two dash one 68 the reappointment of Andre from Feld. From field as a member of the Chicago plan commission for a term effective immediately and expiring January 25th of 2028. Everyone should have received a copy of his resume electronically and in the past, and in the packet before you.

Any questions. If not, can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. All the men Raymond Lopez.

[Speaker 42] (31:28 - 31:33)
Thank you Chairman and good morning members of the committee are either Mr Brumfeld or Miss Lyons here.

[Speaker 1] (31:35 - 31:48)
Yeah, generally, they are not here number one, generally for reappointments. But I've served with both of them, and I'm very impressed with both Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 6] (31:49 - 32:34)
And I also would like to concur with Alderman Tony I served with both of them to add, just as we do with the zoning committee. The plan commission meetings are just as long. So a lot of these guys take out of their personal business schedules to sit on these committees, and, and they stayed of course they come at all of them and they're well engaged, and it is good to have is good to have their knowledge of architecture and development and the other things that they bring to the table is very helpful in helping us to make our decisions so I support this.

Thank you. Other questions, comments, Alderman David Moore.

[Speaker 29] (32:34 - 33:03)
Yes, I just wanted to just add, at least working with Andre Brumfeld I appreciate about him and why am I, why I'm supporting this reappointment, is that he's proactive, he's consistently reaching out to Alderman, asking their ideas but also just checking in and so that I appreciate about Andre so that's why I do recommend and support this reappointment. Thank you.

[Speaker 4] (33:04 - 33:05)
Questions, comments.

[Speaker 1] (33:06 - 34:12)
Just before we take a motion, I just wanted to say if you look at his resume he's really well qualified for the job he also speaks true to, true to the facts. You know he is really a welcome, diverse contribution to the Planning Commission, and I didn't realize we're going to put him in for another umpteen years like five, five or something so I'm, I'm glad that he's willing to serve. All right, get a motion.

Alderman Sawyer makes the motion moved to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine form. Any objections. Hearing none this reappointment is passed.

Next we have document numbers, a 2022 dash 169 the reappointment of Sarah E Lyons as member of the Chicago Planning Commission for a term effective immediately and expiring on January 25 of 2028. Everyone also should have received a copy of a resume electronically and in the packet before you if there are questions by committee members on Ms. Lyons.

[Speaker 6] (34:18 - 34:59)
Alderman Burnett. Thank you. I've also served with Sarah also, same thing as Andre, she put in a lot of hours.

She's with Unite here, and it's good to have a who represent a lot of low to middle income people in the city of Chicago, and it's good to have a perspective from a union that represents hotels on the zoning committee. She sacrificed a lot of time to be there, and she's well engaged and very, very fair and even handed with her decisions, so I support this reappointment.

[Speaker 4] (35:01 - 35:03)
Any other questions, comments?

[Speaker 1] (35:04 - 36:28)
Again, serving with her on the Planning Commission, Alderman Burnett said it best. She's been real, another outspoken individual that really tries to challenge some of these applicants to make sure, especially, I believe on affordable housing and some of the other issues that are pertinent to being on the Planning Commission. All right, so Alderman Burnett makes a motion moved to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections to his motion? Hearing none, this reappointment is passed, and will be reported out tomorrow City Council meeting. All right.

Now we'll move on to the code amendments. First up is 02022-3941, the amendment of application number 21090 to correct the boundary description regarding the zoning reclassification located at 2833 West 47th Street, also 2749 through 2757, 2749 through 2745 West 47th Street, and 4717 through 4723 South California Avenue. We have Noah Sofranik here from the Department of Planning and Development to testify on this correction.

Noah?

[Speaker 36] (36:28 - 36:48)
Yes, good morning, Chairman and members of the committee. This ordinance change is for one singular text change to the description. The ordinance called out West 47th Place, which is a private roadway and cannot be used as a description.

So instead, this will change the line to be measured 315 feet south of and parallel to West 47th Street.

[Speaker 4] (36:48 - 37:06)
No other changes to the bulk density or boundary will be made as a result of this correction. Okay. Alderman Raymond Lopez.

No questions. Okay. Just for the record, I'm reading my narrative.

[Speaker 1] (37:07 - 37:18)
These addresses here, 2833 West 47th, and then it's 2749 through 2757.

[Speaker 36] (37:20 - 37:30)
There's a parcel on the west side of California that was originally built with a dialysis clinic, and then there are two parcels that have been added east of California, but there are parcels that interrupt those parcels.

[Speaker 1] (37:33 - 37:36)
Okay. So that's why we have these two different addresses that look like they overlap.

[Speaker 36] (37:37 - 37:37)
That's correct.

[Speaker 1] (37:38 - 38:52)
Okay. Just want to double check. We've had to come back for things like this.

All right. So Alderman Raymond Lopez makes a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, the ordinance is passed. Next up, 02022-3785, which contains amendments to ordinance number SO2022-2000. The item has a substitute.

All members of the committee should have received a copy of the substitute as well as a summary electronically. And today we have that today. You also find a copy in your folder.

So I'm going to ask for a motion to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Alderman Lopez makes the motion to accept the substitute. Any objections?

Hearing none, the substitute is before us, and we have Patrick Murphy here to present on the matter. I believe, Patrick, ETOD. Yes, sir.

Okay. So members, this is kind of important that we take a look at ETOD and some of the early ramifications, I guess, or unintended, maybe in some cases. In some cases.

Consequences.

[Speaker 3] (38:52 - 38:52)
Sure.

[Speaker 1] (38:53 - 38:54)
All right, Patrick.

[Speaker 3] (38:54 - 40:06)
Good morning, Chairman and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Patrick Murphy with the Department of Planning and Development. We're here to discuss proposed format reference and other non-subsidized changes to certain sections of the recently enacted update to the transit serve location ordinance.

It goes by multiple names. ETOD, connected communities, transit serve location ordinance is how it's defined in the municipal code. To that end, there are a number of sections in the proposed substitute that you accepted.

I'm going to walk through all of the various text changes, and then I'm happy to go back and answer any questions about why those changes are being made or what some of the ramifications of them may be. So in section one, we're aligning controls aimed at reducing new low density projects in defined areas without penalizing current property owners of low density structures. This mimics the language and approach taken in the Pilsen and 606 density preservation overlays.

This section also properly identifies the impacted zoning districts through the usage of the correct abbreviations and eliminates charts that were improperly amended in the original ordinance. Section two.

[Speaker 1] (40:07 - 40:09)
Okay. Okay. Yeah.

Let's translate that.

[Speaker 4] (40:09 - 40:10)
Sure. All right.

[Speaker 3] (40:10 - 41:05)
So if you look under section one, the very bottom of the first page, the words newly established are underlined and detached is changed to a lowercase D. What we're doing is like we did in Pilsen and 606, we're focusing our efforts on newly constructed properties. We don't want to penalize someone who owns a current single family home or two flat for being able to make renovations to that property.

It was legally established. It's been legally maintained. The way this was constructed, which was, it was unintended, but the way this was constructed puts those projects into a nonconforming status, which then impacts their ability to pursue various improvements down the line.

It requires in certain cases, map amendments or trips to the zoning board that may be avoided if we look at only the newly established. So we don't want to penalize current properties. And this is the exact same language that we use in Pilsen and 606.

[Speaker 1] (41:06 - 41:10)
Okay. Raymond Alderman.

[Speaker 4] (41:11 - 41:12)
Thank you, chairman.

[Speaker 42] (41:12 - 41:20)
So does this legalize the illegal conversions that may exist? No, no, no.

[Speaker 3] (41:20 - 41:38)
If something is illegally there, there are other steps to address that. This does not legalize anything that's there. It simply recognizes if it is legally established and it predates the establishment of this ordinance, then they can be treated as a single family home or two flat that they were.

Got it. Thank you.

[Speaker 43] (41:39 - 41:39)
All right.

[Speaker 3] (41:41 - 42:11)
Next portion. If you look at the top of page two, it was just a typographical error. It was, it was listed as RS three and a half.

It should have just been RT three and a half. There's no change to the intent. It was simply a typing error.

The two charts in the middle of the page, RT4A should have been eliminated under the, well, let me back up. That zoning designation was eliminated under the connected communities ordinance. These passages from these two charts were missed in the cleanup.

So this is just removing those texts.

[Speaker 1] (42:12 - 42:15)
So we have no more RT4A.

[Speaker 3] (42:16 - 42:34)
Correct. It's addressed. It wasn't very used.

We're addressing it separately, but this, this just cleans up the text that should have been originally removed. And then lastly, on the bottom of page two and the top of page three, you see just simply formatting corrections on the abbreviation of section.

[Speaker 4] (42:34 - 42:42)
And then again, a removal of the RT4A reference. Okay.

[Speaker 3] (42:42 - 45:43)
Section two references the appropriate use designation and standard. The modified use standard language is found in section three. I'll go through that.

That's a lot of detail, but what it will show is the chart on the bottom of page three where, and I'll explain this as we get into the next section, the reestablishment of the original designations as far as residential uses below the second floor related to detached homes and two flats. I'll explain that in the next section. Section three, again, aligns controls aimed at reducing new low density projects in defined areas without penalizing current property owners of low density structures.

Again, mimicking that language from Pilsen and 606. This section also combines former regulations pertaining to the establishment of three flats in a certain ARO district and on land, which is most proximate to a train and bus station. It includes exit in distance measurements, and I'll go through this and there's a number of references to that for purposes of train station proximity and it eliminates transparency requirements as they relate to non-commercial development subject to pedestrian street standards.

To unpack this a little bit, again, the chart changes that were made in the middle of page three and the top of page four tie into paragraph two on the middle of page four. On a couple of levels, what we're trying to do is A, not penalize existing structures, so you'll notice the word newly established. We want to make sure we focus on allowing projects that already exist, developments that already exist to be maintained.

And then the proximate references that I made from an ARO standpoint deal with the distance to a train and rail station and the location within the ARO community preservation area. So we're only focusing on specific boundaries within ARO and in distance to transit. And then there are restrictions as far as the amount of density that can be built.

The idea under the Connected Communities Ordinance was to promote three flats and larger. So this allows for the three flats to still be provided, but it also allows in the instances where zoning lots are not large enough for people to establish a two flat or a single family home. What we want to avoid is an unbuildable lot where a property cannot be developed under the zoning that exists because of the restrictions based on pursuing further density.

There are going to be some zoning lots that just won't work for a multi-unit building. They won't have the physical space. The next issue is regarding the word exit.

So there are 16 references in the Connected Communities Ordinance to train station entrances and exits. Three additional references just left the word exit out. So this ordinance puts exit in.

Exit was referenced under the former TSL. It's how we measure the boundary distances that existed prior to this ordinance. It was just an omission to leave the word exit out.

That allows for more distances to be covered if doors are not located on the same property or in the same location on the property.

[Speaker 1] (45:44 - 45:50)
So like at Belmont, there is actually an exit that exits onto Fletcher.

[Speaker 3] (45:50 - 47:17)
Correct. There are instances where it comes off of whatever the main street is for the station. It moves it sometimes as much as a block away.

So it allows for more distance to utilize the TSL benefits. And then finally, this is what the chairman was referencing. There have been a number of projects both under the old TSL and this revised TSL ordinance that required pedestrian street standards to be applied to non-commercial projects.

So pedestrian street standards are designed to promote more activity, more vibrancy on commercial corridors. The idea through all of these various transit serve location ordinances was to extend that requirement even when streets are not designated pedestrian streets. We wanted to have a more active street presence.

That has always been a problem for non-commercial projects. So if you have residential on the ground floor, if you're a religious assembly, if you're anything that's not a retail food and beverage, things of that nature, it becomes more complicated. That complication sometimes rears its head in requiring either map amendments, adjustments, or variations to the design of work.

It adds more process and it doesn't change the overall ground floor use. So this change is designed to unwind some of these burdens that the non-commercial projects face. It's the most to make the projects easier to move ahead, acknowledging that these are allowed uses and we would have to make a more drastic change to prohibit non-commercial use.

This helps these projects move ahead faster.

[Speaker 4] (47:20 - 47:22)
And how about the rest?

[Speaker 3] (47:22 - 48:12)
Okay. Sections four and six add back in a dash, which was accidentally excluded in the original ordinance for purposes of proper designation of the impacted zoning district. And it inserts exit for the same purpose that I noted before.

Section four also corrects an erroneous ARO section reference in the building height chart. So if we look in the middle of page five, they may be hard to pick up, but there were various dashes that were accidentally excluded through the course of formatting. This reestablishes those dashes.

So it's clear what zoning districts are being indicated. Again, there's the use of the word exit that was excluded. And then the chart on the top of page six simply realigns with the proper ARO section for purposes of calculating affordability requirements and the relationship to height relief under the TSL ordinance.

[Speaker 1] (48:13 - 48:20)
So just explain the erroneous ARO section regarding the building height.

[Speaker 3] (48:21 - 48:35)
It just simply referenced the wrong version of the ARO. This chart was originally produced before we had the 2021 ARO. All of the references are supposed to be to the new ARO requirements.

And this just directs people to the proper section of the municipal code.

[Speaker 4] (48:36 - 48:54)
It doesn't change any of the standards ARO or height. Section five, this reiterates the changes we made in the neighborhoods in regards to pedestrian street by eliminating the transparency requirements as they relate to non-commercial ground floor uses.

[Speaker 3] (48:54 - 49:48)
So again, it just provides the same benefit in the downtown zoning districts that we're looking to afford in the business and commercial. Sections seven and eight, they provide the proper code section citation. So if you look at the bottom of page seven and the middle of page eight, it's simply, I'm sorry, look at the top of page eight for both.

It starts on the bottom of page seven, but it simply updates the proper code reference for cross-referencing purposes. And then section nine properly references the appropriate use category for parking calculations. When the chart was reproduced, the words that are underlined on the bottom of page eight and the top of page nine were accidentally deleted.

Those are being reestablished as they were before. And Chairman, that concludes all my testimony. I'm happy to go back through any of these sections if anyone has further questions.

[Speaker 1] (49:48 - 49:52)
All right, Patrick. Okay. Questions.

[Speaker 4] (49:52 - 50:04)
I know we had questions as we went through the presentation, but any other questions before I receive a motion to move do pass? All right.

[Speaker 1] (50:07 - 52:30)
I'll admit Mike Rodriguez makes a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to the motion? Hearing none.

This item is passed as amended. Yes. And we've been joined by Chairman Villegas also.

All right. Thanks, Patrick. All right.

Now, we have last up the addendum of large signs over 100 square feet in area 24 feet above grade. We'll hear them all together. I'll read the word followed by the address and take a motion at the end.

In the 11th Ward, one sign located at 810 West 31st Street. In the 14th Ward, one sign located at 5825 South Kedzie Avenue. In the 23rd Ward, 5230 South Cicero Avenue.

Two signs in the 27th Ward at 345 North Morgan Street. One sign in the 42nd Ward at 115 East Riverwalk South. And lastly, three signs in the 45th Ward at 4445 West Irving Park Road.

Any questions by committee members? Hearing none, Alderman Villegas makes a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, the orders are passed. We'll now move on to the regular agenda in an effort to ensure the committee runs smoothly as possible. The typical order in which items will be heard has been updated.

Items will be grouped together according to witness attorney and will be heard in that order rather than the Ward order. Okay, so we'll start on page one of the revised agenda. And I did talk to Alderwoman Pat Dowell.

She would like to defer this item, but let me read it in the record and ask for a motion to defer. That is item number A8790, 3rd Ward. Ordinance was deferred on October 26th of 2022.

Common address is 1910 South Calumet Avenue and the change request from a DX Downtown Mixed Use District to a DR3 Downtown Residential District. Alderman Beal makes a motion to defer this item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, this item will be deferred.

[Speaker 48] (52:33 - 52:34)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (52:34 - 53:48)
Anybody from Alderman Quinn's 13th Ward here? All right, then we're not going to defer it. We're not going to defer it.

We'll just hold this one until we'll see. All right, now we're on to Walter. Document number A8789 in the 27th Ward.

Ordinance was deferred on October 26th of 2022. Common address 452 through 466 North Artesian, also 2429 through 2439 West Grand and the change request from an M12 Limited Manufacturing Business Park District to an RT4 Residential Two-Flat Townhouse and Multi-Unit District. And we have Alderman Burnett on this application.

I think we had the one member of the public comment period that was concerned about her single-family home. Okay, so we have a substitute. All right, Alderman Cardona moves to accept the substitute by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum.

Any objections to the substitute? Hearing none, the substitutes in front of us. Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 6] (53:48 - 54:46)
Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I apologize. I missed that person speaking. I would have tried to explain to them more.

This is a block in my ward of residential housing that's surrounded by industrial, right? And they've been grandfathered into this manufacturing zone for a long time, and it has an adverse effect on their property. For one, their residential property, but they're being taxed as a manufacturing property for one.

For two, they have a challenge even when they go to refinance their home because they're zone manufacturing and they're not residential. And I'm just trying to bring them into compliance because it is a residential block, so we're just bringing them into compliance. They're not conforming right now.

We're just bringing them into compliance so they can have all of the benefits that every other residential block has.

[Speaker 4] (54:47 - 54:48)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (54:49 - 55:44)
I know that we had Miss Girardi that was concerned. She lives in a single family home, I think, for 60 plus years. So we're not.

OK, so you understood the alderman. We're not going to have a discussion, but obviously you can talk to him on the side. But it seems to me to protect your property and the residential uses, which now manufacturing, anything could happen on that on that piece of property.

And so I think you're on the same page. So but feel free to after this to discuss it with him. Any other questions for Alderman Burnett?

With that, Alderman Raymond Lopez moves to pass by the same as amended by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the item is passed as amended.

Alderman Cardona, do you have something you want to tell the chairman?

[Speaker 49] (55:46 - 55:50)
I'm in that kind of mood today, so fire on.

[Speaker 4] (55:50 - 55:51)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (55:52 - 56:24)
OK, so now we're on also in the 27th Ward. We have document number A8794, 27th Ward. Ordinance was referred on November 17th of 2022.

This common address 646 through 654 Ridgeway Avenue and the change request from an RT4 residential two flat townhouse and multiunit district to an RS3 residential single unit detached house district. Again, Alderman Burnett.

[Speaker 6] (56:25 - 57:26)
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So this is a situation where we have several lots over in the West Humboldt Park community where we allowing a developer, the Department of Housing gave the lots to a non-for-profit developer to build single family homes on the lots.

But then because of this TSL, they kind of got caught in a quagmire. So the TSL requires them to be zoned a certain way to RS3 in order to build those houses. So now it is not for profit.

Had to had to get the property rezoned in order to build houses on these on these lots to build single family homes. So I'm just trying to help them to be able to build a lot. Of course, you know, we funding them right.

And so I'm not trying to charge us the city in order to be able to do this. So it's one of the adverse effects of the TSL.

[Speaker 1] (57:28 - 57:37)
That darn Patrick Murphy. So again, I'm in that mood. So all right.

Questions for the Alderman. Alderman Lopez.

[Speaker 42] (57:38 - 57:54)
Thank you. Thank you, Chairman. Actually, I have a question.

When we convey property like that for our partners, why aren't departments required to make the correct zoning for the use that we're giving them the land for?

[Speaker 6] (57:57 - 58:41)
And Alderman, not only that, and I think housing is looking at some things now because not only that, when we do these non-for-profits, there's a lot of things that go into it where these non-for-profits for these affordable houses, they want to charge them water taps, they want to charge them a whole bunch of transportation things, cost them a lot of extra money, which we end up paying because we give them the money to build these things that we should just basically, you know, work together on putting a package together to waive those things when they're doing stuff with for public use. Right.

And then that is not for profit. So it's something that housing is looking at. I brought it up to them and I think they're getting ready to make some changes on those kind of things.

[Speaker 42] (58:41 - 58:59)
So is Department of Planning involved on that? Because I know when we do like our we have this new lot, the mayor's got her lot sales program. And if we're selling lots that are zoned necessarily for housing, we're going to have thousands of people potentially in the same quagmire, as you put it.

[Speaker 6] (59:00 - 59:03)
Yeah, I'm not sure. Patrick.

[Speaker 3] (59:05 - 59:44)
Patrick Burke with the Department of Planning. So we are and we are involved in a number of these transactions. What we try to do is either that the ordinance that proceeds, if a map amendment could be necessary, that whatever the city program is that would be in conflict would trump a previous ordinance.

So not requiring an applicant to go seek a map amendment. That's one avenue we take. Another avenue is having the map amendments go concurrently with whatever the program is so that the property is ready to be redeveloped for whatever the purposes are and someone doesn't have to acquire it and then go through a separate or a secondary city council process.

So we do try to combine those processes together.

[Speaker 42] (59:45 - 1:00:01)
And is there a catch all at the end should the development not happen so that we're not changing zoning like for example for properties conveyed to a not for profit that a year later decides they can't build anything we're not changing map amendments for no reason.

[Speaker 3] (1:00:02 - 1:00:20)
There are various reverse. There are various reversion clauses that allow the city to either take the property back or to have the map amendment we can go through a process with city council though to update to have a new map amendment approved that unwind what was done before the project doesn't proceed. Those are all available options.

Thank you. Thank you.

[Speaker 4] (1:00:20 - 1:00:31)
Thank you. I think all of them say any other questions.

[Speaker 1] (1:00:33 - 1:01:24)
Alderman Cardona make some motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections. Hearing none, the item is passed.

All right, we are going to go to the top of page two, and we are going to read document number a 8791 in the 42nd Ward, the ordinance was referred October 26 of 2022. This common address 39 through 65 East Huron Street, also 671 through 679 North Wabash Avenue, 664 through 678 North Rush Alderman Brendan Riley, the change request from a residential business institutional plan development number 889 to DX 12 downtown mixed use district branded.

[Speaker 47] (1:01:26 - 1:01:52)
Thank you, Chairman. This is simply reverting the zoning at this site to its underlying which is a DX 12. This is a very old plan development that was not executed the entitlements were provided under a previous zoning bonus structure, and this was never acted upon so we are now reverting this back to DX 12 and I appreciate my colleagues support.

[Speaker 1] (1:01:54 - 1:02:46)
Thank you, Brendan. Any questions. Alderman David Moore moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum any objections to that.

Hearing none. This item is passed. All right, staying in 42 committee members.

Let's move to the top of page four document number 22041 in the 42nd Ward ordinance was referred on December 14 of 2022. This common address 125 through 143 East Van Buren Street also 126 through 148 East Balboa Drive change request from the DX 16 downtown mixed use mixed use district to a T transportation district. We have Scott safe.

Good morning here on the application in 42 proceed.

[Speaker 15] (1:02:47 - 1:05:33)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee for the record Scott safe of the law firm Sidley Austin LLP offices at one South Dearborn. I'm here today to my right with representatives of the commuter rail district of the RTA known as Metro Metro seeks as you said a rezoning to the T transportation district of a railroad right of way within Grant Park currently zoned DX 16 the boundaries are Van Buren Extended East where there's a pedestrian bridge to Balboa Drive to the south. That portion of the right of way is below grade within Grant Park.

The railroad right of way is east of Michigan Avenue. It's owned by the city of Chicago. Metro uses it by contract and easement rights for commuter rail service on its electric district line.

It's also used for operation of the South Shore line, which is owned by the northern Indiana commuter transportation district. We call it Nick T for short the city's busway runs along the eastern edge of the area to be rezoned. The T district actually allows a very limited set of uses within the railroad right of way.

Basically exactly how the right of way is used today. Commuter rail busway pedestrian bridges in contrast to the very wide range of authorized uses within DX 16 a number of which might be incompatible with the park location of this railroad right of way. T district was first adopted by the city in 2004 as part of the zoning reform.

It's being requested by Metro across the city as different station projects are proposed or stations are being rehabilitated. This committee heard a T rezoning and favorably recommended it last month. This rezoning is actually one part, a subsidiary part of a series of land use approvals.

Metro is seeking for a comprehensive rehab of the Van Buren station, which is used by both Nick T and Metro. At track level, the improvements include, but are not limited to improved platforms, canopies, a modern underground passageway connecting the station to Michigan Avenue and a rehab of the station's interior, which is below grade and one of the earliest in the system. The rehab includes substantial accessibility improvements east of Michigan Avenue.

Today, accessible users can only get to the station from the west side of Michigan Avenue. As I mentioned before, the T rezoning is one of several applications being sought. Metro has applied for a lakefront protection ordinance consideration of the project that's pending before the plan commission.

We hope to appear before the plan commission by the end of the first quarter. Metro has a comprehensive website about the project. You can Google it.

You can type in Metro Van Buren project. And since this is an appropriate predicate for the project and protective of Grant Park, we ask for your favorable consideration.

[Speaker 47] (1:05:34 - 1:05:35)
Our team is here. If you have any questions.

[Speaker 1] (1:05:36 - 1:05:38)
Thank you. Alderman Reilly.

[Speaker 47] (1:05:40 - 1:06:06)
Thank you, Chairman. I support this zoning change by making this change. Actually, it will benefit the future of Grant Park by removing dx 16 zoning from it.

So I think this works well for both the transportation project and the great upgrades that will be delivered with it, but also is a good zoning policy for Grant Park itself. So with that said, I'd appreciate my colleagues supporting the change. Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:06:06 - 1:06:22)
Questions for the team. Alderman Cardona. Hearing no questions, comments.

Alderman Cardona moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none.

The item is passed.

[Speaker 49] (1:06:22 - 1:06:23)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:06:23 - 1:06:26)
Members get our ridership back a little bit.

[Speaker 29] (1:06:26 - 1:06:27)
Yeah. Sounds good.

[Speaker 1] (1:06:27 - 1:06:27)
Yeah.

[Speaker 29] (1:06:27 - 1:06:28)
All right.

[Speaker 4] (1:06:29 - 1:06:34)
Moving on to page two. Moving back to page two. Where am I?

Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:06:37 - 1:07:00)
We're on the middle of page two in the third ward document number two to zero to seven T one in the third ward. The ordinance was referred on December 14th of 2022 have an address 5021 South Wabash Avenue and the change request for an RT for residential to flat townhouse and multi-unit district to be three three community shopping district.

[Speaker 4] (1:07:01 - 1:07:12)
We have Fisher Cohen in the third ward. Alderman Dowell is not with us this morning, but she has opined on all her applications.

[Speaker 1] (1:07:13 - 1:07:19)
Oh, and all the member voices joined us for the quorum as my right hand person.

[Speaker 17] (1:07:20 - 1:09:18)
All right. Good morning, Mr. Chairman members of the zoning committee. It's a little unusual.

This is my first in person, municipal hearing and since the start of the pandemic. My name is Mark lens I work for the law firm Fisher Cohen Waldman Shapiro LLP. I'm here on behalf of the applicant urban equities, Inc.

With me a favor. For the record, your name again because we have your witnesses, just the firm. Okay, Mark.

And we are okay. Lens, L E and C. Great.

Thanks. So this matter involves the change of zoning on 5021 South Wabash Avenue from RT for residential classification to be three dash three commercial shopping district. The property is presently owned by the city of Chicago, we have a letter on file from the Commissioner of Planning, authorizing us to proceed with the change of zoning.

We're in separate discussions with the Department of Planning and Development to acquire the property and that we hope to close on that sometime. Late spring of this year. The property needs to the zoning classification rather needs to be sought because what we're going to do is to do a commercial shared kitchen, and my client, Lennox Jackson here can provide more details about that.

The existing building was a former streets of sand facility, and that will be rehab, and there will be a new construction building that's going to be developed to the east of the present building, and then we're going to have a front setback request because we're going to have an outdoor porch facing South Wabash Avenue, and then we're also going to be providing two parking spaces at the rear of the building, and my clients are here my team is here if you want to ask some more specific questions.

[Speaker 1] (1:09:19 - 1:09:22)
We do have support from Alderwoman Dowell.

[Speaker 41] (1:09:22 - 1:09:23)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (1:09:23 - 1:09:33)
And since came down and talked to me about shared kitchen. Why don't you say a few words. After you identify yourself.

[Speaker 24] (1:09:33 - 1:10:51)
Sure. Lennox Jackson founder and CEO of Urban Equities Inc. I'm thrilled and excited to be here to talk about Soul City Kitchens.

Soul City Kitchens. Soul City Kitchens dot com. It's a place where someone can learn more information, but effectively what we're looking forward to doing is removing barriers and creating opportunities for those folks who are in the food space, namely chefs, caterers, ghost kitchen operators, food truck operators.

So these will be fully equipped kitchens made available on an as needed basis. We are looking forward to partnering with the Bronzeville Cooking Organization, which is right there on 51st Street that has been working for years to build a culinary ecosystem right there on 51st Street, most specifically at the Boxville project right there by the Green Line. So we're excited about what Soul City Kitchens is intended to do.

We've received a lot of excitement and interest and feedback. And in fact, that would close by saying we've started to build a database of chefs and other food entrepreneurs who are interested in the space. So if all goes well, we look forward to bringing Soul City Kitchens online in 2024.

[Speaker 1] (1:10:52 - 1:10:59)
OK, so now you're in my category, not just zoning. How big is this kitchen or set of kitchens?

[Speaker 24] (1:10:59 - 1:11:24)
So we are going to repurpose the existing Streets and Sands building, which is twelve hundred square feet. Behind it, we're going to build a two story building slab on grade, which will be offered six thousand square feet per floor. One floor will house the various kitchens.

We're projecting anywhere from ten to twelve kitchens on the second floor would be refrigeration, cooling and dry storage.

[Speaker 4] (1:11:26 - 1:11:35)
So you'll have docks and stuff for what about this truck food truck stuff? Now I'm talking like I didn't go to Cornell.

[Speaker 24] (1:11:37 - 1:11:47)
There's parking at the rear off of the alley. There will be a loading, loading doors and access for folks coming in and out with with their food.

[Speaker 1] (1:11:48 - 1:11:53)
But there'll be no food trucks doing business there.

[Speaker 24] (1:11:53 - 1:12:10)
Food trucks will be able to come and principally prep their food. So when you're buying tacos off the local food truck, they've spent some time somewhere prepping all of their food before getting it on the truck and bringing it downtown to serve their tacos.

[Speaker 1] (1:12:11 - 1:12:59)
That sounds exciting. Questions, comments? We've been joined by Alderman Wagesbeck, the quorum.

No comments, questions other than my own. Alderman Kappelman moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Objections?

Hearing none, the item is passed. Good luck. Thank you very much.

All right. Let's see. Bottom of page two.

We're in the first war document number two two zero five one T one in the first ward. Ordinance was referred on December 14th of twenty twenty two. Common address is nineteen twelve West Division Street and the change request from an R.T. for residential two flat townhouse and multi-unit district and a B three two community shopping district all to a B two three neighborhood mixed use district.

[Speaker 48] (1:13:01 - 1:13:04)
Okay. All right.

[Speaker 1] (1:13:04 - 1:13:18)
So this is in your printed. Yep. No PowerPoints today.

Not by any fault of the committee, but we do have hard copies. So Sylvia Mikes is going to talk to this item in the first ward.

[Speaker 48] (1:13:19 - 1:13:28)
It's the first. It's the first presentation. Why don't you tell the committee there is a PowerPoint presentation printed out for the committee members.

[Speaker 19] (1:13:28 - 1:13:31)
It will be the first one in the packet I handed you.

[Speaker 1] (1:13:32 - 1:13:33)
Thank you, Sylvia.

[Speaker 19] (1:13:34 - 1:14:50)
Good morning, Chairman Tunney and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Sylvia Mikes. I'm an attorney with the TAP law firm.

And here with me is Angela Laskaris, who is the owner of the applicant and manager of twelve. I'm sorry. Nineteen twelve division LLC.

The applicant is also the owner of the property located at nineteen twelve West Division. We are here today solely to correct a technical error in the boundary boundary description included in the applicants type one zoning amendment approved at the April twenty seventh twenty twenty two city council hearing. The applicants plans to develop the subject property with a new four story mixed use building containing retail space and a total of seven units remain consistent with their previously approved plans.

In order to proceed with the proposed development, the applicant is seeking to amend the property is current RT four and B three dash two districts to the B two three district. My client is here with us today in case you have any questions. As you know, we have a PowerPoint presentation that was provided to you.

We'd like to thank and acknowledge Alderman La Spada for his continued support of this proposed development, and I believe he has provided a letter of support.

[Speaker 1] (1:14:51 - 1:15:00)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman La Spada. And so you're doing retail on the bottom. Okay, this is a p street.

[Speaker 19] (1:15:01 - 1:15:17)
Yes, it is a p street. So, as part of the type one. We sought a waiver of the seven parking spaces, there's an existing utility involvement in the rear of the property, which makes it unable for us to provide on site parking.

[Speaker 1] (1:15:17 - 1:15:21)
All right, questions, comments, Alderman Cardona.

[Speaker 21] (1:15:21 - 1:15:22)
Thank you, Chairman.

[Speaker 4] (1:15:23 - 1:15:26)
What's the square footage of the property.

[Speaker 19] (1:15:27 - 1:15:31)
The square footage of the property itself. Yes, I believe 3280.

[Speaker 4] (1:15:32 - 1:15:38)
So, they're gonna be seven apartments in that 3280. Correct.

[Speaker 19] (1:15:38 - 1:15:55)
The first, the first unit is at the rear on the first floor. And then there will be two units on each additional floor and again, it's within that it's the same plans that were approved. In April of 2022.

[Speaker 4] (1:15:57 - 1:15:59)
What's the square footage for each apartment.

[Speaker 19] (1:16:00 - 1:16:34)
Each apartment. It looks very narrow and very take a look and see, I actually have the plans of the currency if we've got the floor plan here and 11 by 17. The total of the property of the project is 2.6, as it is a type one, and the square footages. I believe here are about eight.

[Speaker 4] (1:16:35 - 1:16:48)
We did about eight. Well that's the storage. You're looking for the actual units correct.

The two bedroom units for that itself. Okay. Seven two bedrooms.

All right.

[Speaker 38] (1:16:49 - 1:16:52)

The lot actually contains 4320 square feet of total lot area, but it's only 90 feet deep. We did work with Alderman La Spada his office as well as the CG and a community organization, and I believe we have a letter of email at least of support on file with your committee.

[Speaker 1] (1:18:18 - 1:18:56)
All right, we do have a letter of support from Alderman La Spada questions comments. If not Alderman Riley moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections.

The application for zoning changes being sought to permit a new private Jewish high school at the subject property.

The dash to density allows the proposed size of the building on the lot. We did work with Alderman Silverstein's office and hosted a community meeting. We were recommended for approval at that committee and have proceeded to the board or to the committee with that approval I believe email again in support of the application from the Alderman's office and sent the staff.

I'd be happy to answer any questions you or the committee members have.

[Speaker 1] (1:19:43 - 1:19:50)
We do have a letter of support from all the women Silverstein questions comments. Talk to me about parking.

[Speaker 7] (1:19:50 - 1:20:22)
So we are providing eight parking spaces on site. This is a high school. So, the school itself regulates the number of students that drive there are actually no driving students, and our parking is based off of the number of teachers anticipated at the facility so we will have to seek as part of this application will have to seek a special use and as part of that we will have a parking determination, but our plan does have eight on site parking spaces as well as the proposed loading zone to accommodate pickups for the students.

[Speaker 1] (1:20:23 - 1:20:58)
All right. Other questions comments. If not my vice chair rebellious moves to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine form.

The proposed facility will be 34 feet in height, it'll have 216 seats for worship and 27 off street parking spaces all again on site. The current configuration of the building limits to I think for legal parking spaces so off off street parking has been a bit of an issue. This plan addresses that by providing all of our required parking on site.

Again, we did work with Alderman Silverstein participated in a community meeting, and we believe a letter or an email of support has been forwarded to your office.

[Speaker 1] (1:21:57 - 1:22:03)

[Speaker 11] (1:32:08 - 1:32:43)
Good morning. Members of the committee for the record Carol stubble field with Neil Roy offices located at 20 South Clark here on behalf of the applicant Bella Noir LLC with me today is Maria homes with Bella Noir and Jason Nettleman the architect of record from seek design. Mr Chairman, this is a type one rezoning and we'd like to confirm that the record reflects that we did submit recently.

After we had had the matter introduced city council, we had circulated and submitted revised drawings and narrative and a form application to the Department of zoning so we just want to make sure that that's captured.

[Speaker 4] (1:32:43 - 1:32:49)
Hold on one. We have a substitute other type one.

[Speaker 48] (1:33:08 - 1:33:11)
We don't have a substantive narrative.

[Speaker 11] (1:33:12 - 1:33:17)
No, so the ordinance isn't substituted it's the form application the project narrative.

[Speaker 4] (1:33:18 - 1:33:34)
And the drawings to reflect 3027 units. Okay. Yeah, the meeting the actual app.

The narrative is revised.

[Speaker 11] (1:33:35 - 1:33:37)
Oh, you should have put substitute at the top.

[Speaker 48] (1:33:39 - 1:33:41)
We have that information.

[Speaker 1] (1:33:41 - 1:33:47)
All right. Are we going to move on with this, or we have to hold.

[Speaker 11] (1:33:47 - 1:34:12)
So what we submitted it, it sounds like at the top, we, we, we failed to put the word substitute, but the change the change was only as to the number of dwelling units went from 26 to 27. And so we revised the narrative and the form application and the drawings to reflect that change.

[Speaker 3] (1:34:13 - 1:34:16)
And it would still fall into the MLA.

[Speaker 11] (1:34:16 - 1:34:28)
Oh, yeah, yeah yeah everything stays the same right same number of affordable housing units same, you know, MLA is is is consistent the number of parking spaces stays the same etc is just one unit difference.

[Speaker 1] (1:34:28 - 1:34:47)
Yeah, that's not all right. So then we'll need to make a motion from Alderman Beal to accept the substantive narrative and plans for the type one by the same type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections.

Hearing on the substitute is in front of us. Proceed.

[Speaker 11] (1:34:47 - 1:36:22)
Thank you, Mr Chairman. So the subject property is located in the Bronzeville community and is owned in part by the city of Chicago and we do have a letter of consent, authorizing the applicant to move forward while the applicant finalizes a redevelopment with the city and closes on the land which we expect to be later this first quarter. The development team did present this project to the committee on design back in August and the final drawings and the plans and everything do reflect all comments that were received by COD Department of Planning zoning and the community.

The applicant seeks a type one rezoning from a B one one to a B three three to construct a new approximately 91,000 square foot health and wellness hub development, which will include 27 residential dwelling units 37 on site parking spaces, a full size basketball court for youth and young adults, a rehab center pharmacy medical offices, and the developers not for profit foundation headquarters. This project does require affordable housing, the 10% requirement so three will be provided on site. This project is also a transit served location for his proximity to CTA bus line and the CTA train station.

So the project will seek a reduction in the onsite required parking which requires a administrative adjustment approval, and the project also with TSL obtained building height increase the applicant worked with alderman King, believe it a letter of support was provided to the committee and be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 4] (1:36:23 - 1:36:34)
All right. Questions, comments. We do have a letter of support from all the woman.

And just briefly.

[Speaker 1] (1:36:35 - 1:36:42)
We talked about 27 units, talk to me more about the commercial space and how big it is and what we're trying to accomplish here.

[Speaker 11] (1:36:43 - 1:36:53)
I'm going to let Maria homes from the applicant talk about the commercial project and the wellness hub. So if you just want to go to your microphone, introduce yourself.

[Speaker 33] (1:36:53 - 1:37:48)
Good morning my name is Rita homes and I am the owner developer of Villanova. So for the commercial space, we are looking to bring something for the community that they it's like kind of like a one stop shop so we'll have medical offices that will pertain to mental health and integrative health. Also we'll have on the first floor, we'll have several different restaurants we're looking to get more healthy eateries in the Bronzeville neighborhood.

And then our foundation we also run a lot of different programs throughout the city of Chicago so we're trying to locate our main hub there in our building. Also, we'll do a lot of farm to table from a farm that we've purchased we're going to do a lot of farmer table bringing in produce and products for the community. We also have our residential is going to be partnered with University of Chicago for their veterans.

So, also, how big is the commercial space.

[Speaker 1] (1:37:50 - 1:37:54)
And then you talked I heard a basketball court I mean just I'm just kind of more intrigued by that.

[Speaker 33] (1:37:55 - 1:38:12)
So, my architect is tell you about the spaces I don't know the numbers off hand but for the basketball court is also part of our youth program and so we partner with a lot of other schools throughout the city of Chicago to bring in their students and the youth to run programs through the summer and after school. So as far as the spacing.

[Speaker 44] (1:38:15 - 1:38:39)
And you are. Yeah, I'm Jason Edelman founding principal at seek design and architecture, and on the ground floor we have about 10,000 square feet of commercial space, that's divided into one main commercial tenant which is about 5000 square feet, and the other one is going to be subdivided into two different smaller community focused commercial spaces.

[Speaker 4] (1:38:43 - 1:38:51)
Where's the basketball court. So the basketball court what's really interesting is on the second floor we've actually elevated the basketball court full size basketball court.

[Speaker 44] (1:38:52 - 1:39:05)
And we brought that to the front of the building so it'll be kind of like a light beacon for the community elevated on the second floor so we've done that intentionally to follow suit with the programming that is within the building.

[Speaker 1] (1:39:07 - 1:39:13)
Right, I mean it's the total square footage on the ground floor is x, I'm hearing three tenants.

[Speaker 44] (1:39:14 - 1:39:14)
Right.

[Speaker 4] (1:39:16 - 1:39:18)
What's the square footage there.

[Speaker 44] (1:39:19 - 1:39:21)
Total square footage for the first floor.

[Speaker 4] (1:39:22 - 1:39:22)
Yes.

[Speaker 44] (1:39:23 - 1:39:43)
So we have approximately 10,000 square feet for commercial space we have two lobbies one lobby that's for the residential units. One lobby that is for the office commercial spaces that are second floor and above. And then off the alley we have all of this surface parking spaces.

[Speaker 1] (1:39:43 - 1:39:50)
Okay, well, a lot of things going on here there are just trying to wrap my arms around it so. All right, questions.

We have 80% of our letters of intent. I'm sorry, 80%, we still have 20% like, I think it's two more restaurants we have to fill, but we're talking with several ones now.

[Speaker 4] (1:40:16 - 1:40:23)

[Speaker 4] (1:41:03 - 1:41:09)
Yeah, yeah. All right. We're on top.

[Speaker 1] (1:41:09 - 1:41:32)
Top of page five document number two to 055 11th Ward ordinance was referred on December 14 of 2022 and the common address is 3000 through these 3048 South Allstate Street change request from B one to neighborhood shopping district to be three to community shopping district. And we have Mr Warren silver on this app.

[Speaker 2] (1:41:33 - 1:43:53)
Morning Mr Chairman members of the committee. I'm very happy to be here and see everybody in person. I am Warren silver of silver law office PC offices at 1700 West Irving Park Road here today representing the applicant circuit associates LLC.

The request is to change the zoning district from its current be one dash two to the proposed be three dash to the subject property is improved with a one story retail shopping center. A little bit over 50,000 square feet of retail space over 14 stores and 105 parking spaces. The purpose of the rezoning is to allow updating of the existing legal non conforming signage, which is far greater than allowed in the be one districts.

In this case we're replacing the very old style main sign for the shopping center with a more modern kiosk design that is actually smaller. The old sign is 25 feet nine inches tall. The new one is 24 feet tall.

The old one was 14 feet, four inches wide. The new one is 13 feet wide. The total sign area in the center will be reduced from the current legal non conforming 1523 square feet to a total of 1419 square feet, which would conform in the proposed be three dash two district.

We have been in communication with older person, Lee's office attended a virtual community meeting, where we presented the proposal to interested residents of the 11th Ward, and we're pleased to report that we received the support of all the personally. And we've provided a copy of her letters for to the committee to supplement what she may have sent in already.

[Speaker 1] (1:43:54 - 1:44:11)
We do have a letter of support or at least an email of sorts from all the woman Lee and questions comments. And do you identify yourself, you're drew trammel for the applicant circuit associates LLC.

[Speaker 12] (1:44:11 - 1:44:27)
So you own this. I work for the entity that owns the shopping center correct. Is it been owned in the same for a long time yeah like just updating them are 20 years.

Yeah, the pylon sign is dated and terrible and we would like to put a nice new one.

[Speaker 4] (1:44:27 - 1:44:44)
And it's changing image, or no, it's what is there any changing image on it. No, no, no, just all the current tenants panels. Okay, department.

No problems. Okay. Other questions, comments if not.

[Speaker 1] (1:44:45 - 1:44:55)
Alderman Cardona makes a motion move do pass by the same roll call it was used to determine quorum, any objections. Hearing none the items passed. Is this a mall are fully occupied.

[Speaker 12] (1:44:56 - 1:45:04)
We have one vacant space. 15. Good.

It's got a Walgreens and a unique thrift and great. All right, thank you. Good luck.

[Speaker 1] (1:45:05 - 1:45:51)
Moving on to page five middle of page five. And to document number two to 036 t 146 Ford ordinance was referred December 14 of 2022 and the common address is 4642 North Magnolia Avenue, change request from an RS three residential single unit detached house district to an RT for residential to flat townhouse and multi unit district. And for the benefit of the committee members we did have a person who claims has neighbors that are opposing this.

We have not other than his letter the, we do not have other negative reactions to this but let's start on the application.

[Speaker 2] (1:45:51 - 1:51:28)
Okay, thank you Mr Chairman members of the committee. For the record again my name is Warren silver of silver law office PC office at 1700 West Irving Park Road here today representing the applicant and owner of the subject property Lakeview property rentals LLC. Our CEO series.

And with me today. To my right is a lossless him of it who is the architect for the project. I here to answer any questions that the committee may have the current zoning district as you mentioned Mr Chairman is RS three.

And the property has been vacant. Since 2014. When the improvements were demolished pursuant to the demolition permit issued at that time.

The proposed project for which we request RT for zoning district is a three story residential apartment building, containing six dwelling units and six outdoor parking spaces. We have been in touch with Alderman Kaplan, and have been in communication with the community group as well. At Alderman Kaplan's request.

We proceeded as an elective type one rezoning application. I will point out to the committee that the type one plans and narrative that were introduced are not changed from the introduction. There was a small change in those plans from as presented to the community group to what was introduced to City Council, in order to account for a rooftop stairwell enclosure that was within the required front setback.

And so we changed made a minor change to those plans before introduction to move it back out of the setback. I know that there were concerns about other features that are not shown on those plans. And if they were to be added.

The speaker mentioned fireplaces and chimneys. Those are allowed in the type one process. So long as the building remains in substantial conformity with various bulk requirements and in strict conformance with the required density, and we will be developing it with the, the six dwelling unit density shown in the plans and described in the narrative.

Obviously, in order to get a building permit, any of those features if there are any further changes will be in conformance with the Chicago building codes. And we reviewed different requests from the community group, they asked that the, the brick be identified we provided samples for their review and alderman Kappelman submitted the brick choice to the Department of Planning and Development, and reported that they approved it as fitting in with the surrounding area and the district. The community group requested that the existing ornamental fences and the front and sides be retained.

We, the applicant agreed to remove them for the construction period to provide access to the site that was necessary to complete construction, and that to the extent feasible, depending on the condition of defenses which are quite old, they would be reinstalled if it was possible. They were concerned about trash and recycling bins that needed to be accessed through a garage. We did eliminate the garage and provided for outdoor parking.

And so that concern was addressed. They wanted the mature trees in the parkway to be preserved, which, again, to the extent feasible, depending on the needs for access to the site for construction, we would make every effort to preserve those trees. And then the last request was that the adjacent neighbors be provided permanent rights of access, some sort of easement for them to come onto the property for maintaining their own property.

And that we declined. It's not typical to provide for those easements on a permanent basis, that if a project does require access to adjacent property, it's typically negotiated between the owners of the property at the time of the project on a case-by-case basis and based on the nature and type and extent of access. It gets worked out at the time between those property owners.

And so we declined to have a formal property right at this time.

[Speaker 1] (1:51:29 - 1:51:33)
But Alderman Kaplan is here. Do you want to comment?

[Speaker 2] (1:51:34 - 1:51:34)
Sure.

[Speaker 10] (1:51:34 - 1:54:31)
Thank you, Chairman. The owner of this property, 4642 North Magnolia, tried to up-zone this property around eight years ago, as Mr. Silver said, and the local block club opposed it, and I supported their decision. Mr. Tangor was adamant that the zoning not change and wanted the owner to only build a single family home at that site. If a single family home is built there, the cost would be anywhere between $1.5 million to $2 million. The owner tried selling the property so that a single family home could be built at that site, and around 20 different potential buyers refused when they learned that it could only be built for a single family home. The lot has now been vacant for several years, and during that time, we've experienced a shortage of housing that is causing area rents to go up.

Frustrated that the lot remained vacant for several years, the owner approached me again about building a six-flat. The developer held a community meeting before the community where they asked questions, and the developer responded. For context, there are 10 six-flats and eight-flats on that block, three large apartment buildings, one three-flat, and four single families located there.

In July, the members of the local block club agreed with the need for more housing, and they voted in favor of this development with no additional requirements, but they did ask for these five items, and Mr. Silver has explained those five items very well. And my experience with the owner of this property is that he does backflips to respond to the needs of the community, including the concerns that the next-door neighbor has about having access to the property. Actually, Mr. Tangora painted the side of his home and used the property that's being discussed for construction crews to do the painting, and there was no objections whatsoever. Finally, Mr. Blakemore suggested that this was a zoning change that involved pay to play. That's simply not true. In fact, the owner gave $5,000 to a candidate who ran against me in 2015.

I firmly believe not only would it be unethical to do pay to play, but it would also be unethical for me to deny an upzone to a property owner because he supported a candidate who ran against me. So with that, I ask my colleagues to support this zoning change on the parcel of this property.

[Speaker 4] (1:54:36 - 1:55:00)
I think what was said, especially the context of the block, I think is pretty pertinent to the density that's already on that street. So it's not like it's not compatible, I should say. Any other questions or comments?

I get a motion to move do pass.

[Speaker 1] (1:55:00 - 1:55:38)
So moved by Alderman Raboias, by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections to that? Hearing none, the item is passed.

Good luck. Oh, we still have one more with you I think, Walter, or Warren. Okay, so, bottom of page five, document number 22054 in the 49th board ordinance was referred on December 14 of 2022 and the common address is 7319 North Rogers Avenue.

Change request from B13 Neighborhood Shopping District to B25 Neighborhood Mixed Use District. Warren Silver, again, in 49. Thank you very much.

[Speaker 2] (1:55:38 - 1:58:41)
Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, again, for the record, I am Warren Silver of Silver Law Office PC with offices at 1700 West Irving Park Road in Chicago. I'm here today representing the applicant and owner of this property, the Manderley Group Roman One LLC, series 7319N Rogers. And with me here is the manager, the applicant, Josh Dolgen.

The property is currently zoned B1-3. We're seeking to change the zoning district to B2-5. The property is currently improved with a three-story mixed-use building.

There are 15 dwelling units. One-five. One-five, 14 of which are above the ground floor and one of which is at the ground floor, legally nonconforming.

There is a 16th unit in the building that, until recently, was a commercial space occupied by a beauty salon. The beauty salon operator decided to close the business. And this is a location that is surrounded by residential properties for the most part.

And the continued commercial use was likely not going to be viable. At the same time, there is substantial need for quality housing that is affordable to people of modest means, even if they don't qualify strictly for the affordable requirements or ordinance. And that's what this building offers.

So the purpose of the rezoning to a B2 district is to allow that second ground floor unit to be converted to residential use. And the change to the dash-five designation is to allow the density with the 16 units on this site to conform to the zoning ordinance. It is a property that is well served by transit.

There is no parking on site already. We're only adding one unit, which does not require any additional parking to be added under the zoning ordinance. But this is a location where the lack of parking will not be a hardship because it is so well served by transit.

We engaged with Alderwoman Hatton's office, provided the information that her office requests for zoning change requests. And she reported back that she supported the requested zoning change.

[Speaker 1] (1:58:42 - 1:58:48)
And I believe she transmitted the letter and she is here as well. Why don't we hear from Alderwoman Hatton.

[Speaker 8] (1:58:48 - 1:59:37)
Thank you, Chair. Hey Warren. Yes, so as the as Warren has mentioned on behalf of the applicant.

This is pretty straightforward so we have had a few instances in the 49th Ward where we have mixed use buildings that have maybe one commercial space the commercial spaces been vacant for a long time or sometimes recently vacated. And we've been very supportive in the 49th Ward of owners who look to convert these spaces into residential spaces, especially as it's helping us to increase some of our accessible housing with these ground floor residential units. So based on the location of the space, based on the type of the property.

This is something that we do support.

[Speaker 1] (1:59:38 - 1:59:41)
Thank you, Alderwoman, just a question for the department.

[Speaker 4] (1:59:41 - 1:59:44)
Why the five.

[Speaker 1] (1:59:45 - 2:00:10)
Is that what fits like the glove or further density for the density for the density. Okay, so it couldn't fit under the B3. No.

Okay, great. Any other questions comments. If not Alderman Cardona moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine form.

Any objections. Hearing none. This item is passed.

[Speaker 4] (2:00:10 - 2:00:11)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (2:00:12 - 2:00:43)
All right. Is this a take a motion on this one. All right, we have another one that's going to be deferred I'll read it into the record.

Document number two to 050 11th Ward ordinance was referred on December 14 of 2022. Common address to 2819 South Troop Avenue to Troop Street change request from an RS three residential single unit detached house district to an RM 4.5 residential multi unit district. We have Mark.

[Speaker 18] (2:00:44 - 2:00:45)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (2:00:46 - 2:00:49)
Yes. So you're aware that he's deferring.

[Speaker 18] (2:00:49 - 2:00:56)
Mr. Chairman for record by Mark Kupiec I'm the attorney for the applicant. And yes I'm aware that the ultimate wanted to defer this he still has a question. So no problem.

[Speaker 1] (2:00:57 - 2:01:19)
So, the other woman Lee asked this item to be deferred, and I get a motion from a committee member to defer Alderman Beal makes the motion to defer this item by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections. No objections, Mr. No objection we talked about it. The item will be deferred.

[Speaker 18] (2:01:20 - 2:01:20)
All right, that's fine.

[Speaker 1] (2:01:21 - 2:01:50)
Next, let's see middle of page six document number 21141 t one in the 25th board ordinance was spurred on September 21 of 2022. This common address 1600 South Laughlin Street change request from an M one to limited manufacturing business park district and M one three limited manufacturing business park district, all to a B to five neighborhood mixed use district. All right, Mark.

[Speaker 18] (2:01:50 - 2:02:26)
Thank you, Mr Chairman Mark Kupiec. I'm an attorney with office of 77 West Washington represent the applicant. I have with me today Mike Foxy to beside me on behalf of the applicant, and next to him, Peter Meyer of Meyer Jeffers Gillespie architects the project architect.

One procedural matter. We'd like to proceed I did submit the zoning department a substitute narrative and plans. Actually there was one very small change in the plans the architect just added a curb to separate the outdoor parking spaces from the drive aisle.

So but that's the substitute and we would like to proceed on the substitute.

[Speaker 4] (2:02:27 - 2:02:27)
All right.

[Speaker 1] (2:02:28 - 2:02:42)
So, all the men were boys moves to accept the substantive narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine form. Any objections. Hearing none, the substitute is in front of us.

[Speaker 18] (2:02:42 - 2:04:17)
Thank you. And project is convert an old industrial building to residential use at four dwelling units, 42 parking spaces. The old building is the former Otis elevator foundry building by Otis elevator company was their foundry where they used to make parts for their elevators.

We're looking to convert that old building adaptive reuse and use it for residential purposes. Despite the historic industrial use of this building right across the alley is residential to the south of that is residential going to 18th Street and beyond 18th Street. So our residential use would be very compatible with the neighborhood as it exists today.

In addition, this location is a transit serve location. We're just a short distance from Ashland Avenue. Also about 1200 feet from the pink line rapid transit station on 18th Street.

Also this building is in the national historic district. And Mr Fox and his company actually has extensive experience rehabbing and converting old historic buildings in the city of Chicago. It's been a long process.

Mike has attended many of the alderman zoning zoning council meetings with respect to the project. We had one larger community meeting on site in person with mailed notice to describe the project to the community. And after that Mike has followed up with the alderman and his staff to ask for his support, and I believe you have a letter from the alderman.

[Speaker 1] (2:04:18 - 2:04:21)
We do and I think all of in situ Lopez.

[Speaker 4] (2:04:23 - 2:04:24)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:04:24 - 2:04:37)
So we have received his support he couldn't stay for this one but it's obviously by the narrative, pretty appropriate. What happened to Otis elevator.

[Speaker 7] (2:04:38 - 2:05:01)
Peter Meyer, can you address that town because of labor issues in 1916, and that's when the boundaries used to be. They seized manufacturing in Chicago, because of a labor dispute and like teen when 16, the building was built in 1902.

[Speaker 1] (2:05:02 - 2:05:28)
Because it's a story name in Chicago. All right. Again, we have letters of letter of support from all the message for Lopez.

I'm just kind of interested to see what the building looks like I know we don't have a hand up. Actually, I have several handouts. I just think some of these historic buildings since it is historic.

[Speaker 4] (2:05:28 - 2:05:29)
Sure.

[Speaker 1] (2:05:29 - 2:05:30)
And adaptive reuses.

[Speaker 4] (2:05:31 - 2:05:31)
Yeah.

[Speaker 18] (2:05:34 - 2:05:46)
Actually, Mike and his company have had experience with number of other buildings in Chicago and done a real nice job on several of these old buildings inserts that show what the building looks like now.

[Speaker 7] (2:05:46 - 2:05:47)
So the building.

[Speaker 1] (2:05:48 - 2:05:59)
They left in 16. It's 100 years ago. What's been transpired what has this building been re was it actually of some other sorts.

[Speaker 39] (2:06:00 - 2:06:59)
Well, it's been for about since the 1950s. Till last year, it was a lithography production facility, same families owned it since then. They sold their company, and they kept this property, the buyer of the company didn't want the property is in pretty bad shape.

He had another facility actually just a couple miles away. So, when his lease was up last year he moved out. And so it's been vacant since then.

It's, you know, it's just one of those uses that I driven past this building 1000 times it just didn't seem appropriate backing up to all the residential. And so, they made signs for the most part like painted metal signs and so it was kind of smelly and a lot of trucks and I think it's a, I'm glad I've got a chance to look at it I think it really kind of a needle adaptive reuse and put some fun units there.

[Speaker 1] (2:07:01 - 2:07:06)
And I mean this, this is the zoning committee but this looks like a very expensive project.

[Speaker 39] (2:07:08 - 2:07:32)
Right. You know we do one every few years, I do a lot of running around myself. And so we keep them.

Yeah, so hopefully it works. So yes I've applied for we have not been approved yet. But I have to do that balance with them.

I have a lot of people I need to make happy. This is just step one.

[Speaker 1] (2:07:32 - 2:07:39)
Right, well the Alderman seems happy in the community so I appreciate any other comments or questions for the record that was Mike, Mike Fox.

[Speaker 18] (2:07:39 - 2:07:40)
That's okay.

[Speaker 39] (2:07:41 - 2:07:46)
Both of you just wanted to identify yourself, like box on the represent the owner of the property.

[Speaker 7] (2:07:46 - 2:07:49)
Peter Meyer Meyer Jeffers class the architects.

[Speaker 39] (2:07:49 - 2:07:49)
Right.

[Speaker 7] (2:07:50 - 2:07:51)
Well, it's.

[Speaker 39] (2:07:52 - 2:07:53)
I think it's a great project.

[Speaker 1] (2:07:53 - 2:08:08)
So, can I get a motion move to pass by the same roll call it was used to determine form that motion was made by Alderman Cardona. Any objections. Hearing on this item is passed with the substantive narrative and plans.

[Speaker 18] (2:08:08 - 2:08:09)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (2:08:09 - 2:08:38)
All right. Let me see, we're now on the bottom of page six document number 2047 t one in the 11th Ward, the ordinance was referred on December 14 of 2022 common address 831 West 33rd Street and the change request from an RS three residential single unit detached house district to an RM five residential multi unit district, Fred Augusta. Hi Fred.

[Speaker 37] (2:08:38 - 2:09:24)
Good afternoon, Chairman, members of the committee for the record, Fred Augusta, attorney with the law offices of Augusta and Associates LLC, with offices at 20 North Walker Street. I'm here on behalf of the applicant, Samantha true skis applicant owns the property at 831 West 33rd Street properties currently improved with two residential buildings. The front building is a three story building containing two units, while the rear building contains three dwelling units.

The applicant is seeking to rezone the property from the current RS three district to an RM five district. Mr Chairman before I proceed. I did this is a type one application I did submit substitute narrative plans.

I'd like to have those plans and narrative incorporated into the record.

[Speaker 1] (2:09:24 - 2:09:38)
All men were boys moves to accept the substantive narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections. Hearing none, the substitutes in front of us.

[Speaker 37] (2:09:39 - 2:10:20)
So the existing structures will remain the reason for changes for two reasons. First, the front building experienced a fire and was damaged. So the changes necessary in order to rebuild the front building.

Second, the front building had an existing three story addition that was unfortunately never lawfully established. So the zoning change would. In addition, establish that existing three story edition.

We have worked with older woman Lee and her office on this matter we did have a community meeting on this project. All were in support I believe you should have a letter of support on file, we do have a lot of support from all the woman Lee questions comments.

[Speaker 1] (2:10:23 - 2:10:23)
Parking.

[Speaker 37] (2:10:24 - 2:10:26)
There is no on site parking currently.

[Speaker 1] (2:10:27 - 2:10:51)
And you said your witnesses here is. She is not she was not with us. All right, just wanted to make sure she would be recognized.

She's not, and the older woman is in support of it. So can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum Alderman Vegas makes that motion. Any objections.

Hearing none, the item is passed with a substantive narrative and plans.

[Speaker 49] (2:10:51 - 2:10:51)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:10:52 - 2:11:17)

Good afternoon Mr Chairman members of the committee I am Tom Pekarski of the law from Gordon and Pekarski on behalf of the applicant Margarita Bechstein. We're before you, seeking an amendment of the city of Chicago zoning map from the current RS two to that of an RS three for the property commonly known as 3635 through 37 West 59th place. The subject size site consists of two legal lots.

Unfortunately, the city has interpreted that the two legal lots have been used in conjunction, thus forming a single zoning lot. With this application we seek, we seek to subdivide the to the single zoning lot into two, two lots. The lot at 3635 or 3637 will maintain the existing single family home.

The lot at 3635 will be improved with a new single family home. We have reviewed our plans with alderman to bear us who has provided a letter of support for the proposal to the chairman, and we would therefore ask the committee to vote as recommendation of passage of the application to the full city council.

[Speaker 1] (2:15:17 - 2:15:56)
Thank you, Tom we do have a letter of support from older woman to bars. Questions comments. Hearing none.

Good afternoon again, Tom Pekarski of the law firm of Gordon and Pekarski on behalf of the applicant, nobody's darling LLC were before you seeking an amendment of the city of Chicago zoning map from the current B one one to that of a C one two for the property commonly known as 1742 through 54 West Bell moral Avenue. The subject site is improved with a one story commercial building in which several storefront businesses are located. Nobody's darling is an existing tavern located at in the 1744 West Bell moral address of the of this building.

It would like to expand into the adjacent and vacant 1746 Westbound moral space. Unfortunately a tavern is not permitted under the present zone and present be one one zoning. The applicant seeks to amend the zoning to see one two to allow the expansion.

We have reviewed our plans with Alderman Vasquez who has provided a letter of support, and we have presented our proposal to the 40th board advisory zoning council, as well as neighbors, where the proposal was has received universal and enthusiastic support. Therefore, we asked the committee to vote it's recommendation of passage of the application to the full city council. Thank you, Tom.

[Speaker 1] (2:17:14 - 2:17:16)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Vasquez.

[Speaker 14] (2:17:16 - 2:17:54)
Just how much of an expansion is this pretty big, basically doubling the size but these are storefronts these are not the entirety of the building. If you're familiar with the Paul lines restaurant that takes up a good portion of this building space. So it's it's it's doubling the size won't double the capacity.

And sounds like neighborhood is thrilled. Everybody's thrilled it's a year old business and almost a victim of our success and having to ask for this like that.

[Speaker 1] (2:17:54 - 2:18:04)
Any other questions, comments, otherwise Alderman Beal was do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections. Hearing none.

This is one of the sites that we continue to discover has split zoning it's got a B32 and an RT for technically, you cannot operate a school in a B district. And so we have to consolidate the zoning, get it to an R zone, so we can continue to operate the school. That's the only purpose of this rezoning, we are doing some renovations to the school.

And we're going to need permits for those we don't want to have any issues getting the permits. So therefore we're going to.

You want to get to get. We have a mic for that one.

[Speaker 41] (2:21:57 - 2:22:49)
I can also speak up. Great. My name is Ann Louie I'm the architect of on the project.

My client, Mary pro ID is building out a new restaurant at 6004 West North Ave. Just to give context this project as part of the Department of Planning and Development neighborhood opportunity fund, which supports equitable development for small businesses on the south and west side. The project is a one story masonry building. It's currently a vacant retail store and she is building out a new restaurant including a rooftop commercial roof deck for the restaurant.

We're looking at changing from a B one dash one neighborhood shopping district to a B three dash one community shopping district, and the project has the support of alderman Chris Talia Farrow, we handed the letter over just previously. And that's it from us.

[Speaker 1] (2:22:49 - 2:22:57)
Right. Do you have received the letter of support from all mental apparel. Do any of you two want to talk about this.

[Speaker 8] (2:22:58 - 2:23:30)
Sure. I'm sorry. My name is Mary pretty.

I'm the owner of the property of the project, and we're involved with neighborhood opportunity fund. And part of our reason for doing this is to provide jobs for the community and careers for the people in the community. And so we like to expand, we have a small space.

So we'd like to expand it to the roof deck in order to accommodate more customers, and that would give us also the ability to hire more staff.

[Speaker 21] (2:23:32 - 2:23:42)
And you're, you're along for the ride or along for the ride and very supportive of the project is exciting project in the neighborhood. I'm Carl Brinson.

[Speaker 1] (2:23:43 - 2:23:43)
Okay.

[Speaker 21] (2:23:43 - 2:23:43)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (2:23:44 - 2:23:46)
So you have an existing restaurant now.

[Speaker 8] (2:23:46 - 2:24:12)
Well, no, the building was formally cones clothing store, and we purchased it last year, when I applied for the neighborhood opportunity grants. And so we sold most of the clothes, we've been in bed with the community actually since that time and we've gotten to know people they're very excited about having a fine dining restaurant in that area I think it's probably is the only one in that area.

[Speaker 1] (2:24:14 - 2:24:26)
Okay. Again, you're talking to a restaurateur, so I know I've eaten your cinnamon rolls, but you've not not had prior restaurant background.

[Speaker 8] (2:24:26 - 2:24:30)
Yes, I have. I've owned a restaurant in Ravenswood Manor.

[Speaker 1] (2:24:30 - 2:24:31)
Okay.

[Speaker 8] (2:24:31 - 2:24:36)
I've also owned a restaurant in Galena, Illinois. And I've been a caterer for a number of.

[Speaker 1] (2:24:36 - 2:24:41)
Okay, so you do have obviously. Oh yeah. Okay, it's not just about jobs, it's about being successful.

[Speaker 8] (2:24:41 - 2:24:43)
Well yeah. Well that's first.

[Speaker 49] (2:24:44 - 2:24:44)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:24:45 - 2:24:46)
Yeah, I just wanted to double check.

[Speaker 8] (2:24:46 - 2:24:48)
Oh, well you're a restaurateur you understand.

[Speaker 1] (2:24:49 - 2:24:50)
Well I want them to succeed.

[Speaker 8] (2:24:50 - 2:24:50)
Yeah.

[Speaker 1] (2:24:51 - 2:24:57)
And, you know, I. Congratulations on the neighborhood opportunity grant what was that amount.

[Speaker 8] (2:24:58 - 2:24:59)
$250,000.

[Speaker 1] (2:25:00 - 2:25:03)
And, and size of this restaurant.

[Speaker 8] (2:25:04 - 2:25:13)
The interior, we're seating 45 people like like 3000 square feet, it's about 1200 square feet or 200 square feet.

[Speaker 41] (2:25:13 - 2:25:33)
It's a really small building, and I think it's going to, from a design point of view it's kind of split 5050 back of house and the dining area. There's about 30 seats at booth and open seating. So I think expanding both to the patio and the roof deck is going to give Mary additional seating for this restaurant, but the vibe is intimate and high end.

[Speaker 1] (2:25:34 - 2:25:35)
Good luck.

[Speaker 8] (2:25:35 - 2:26:37)
Very, very interesting cuisine to and I've already what type of cuisine so I can well it's mine. It's, it's a combination of Italian, African American, African Greek Mediterranean, and I've already done presentations for the, the association, and what am I trying to say, the business association, and a number of community residents attended this presentation, and they love the food, it's very different. They wanted to know what kind of food is this, because they didn't have any idea, but it was so interesting.

But when my granddaughter who was serving them said it's my grandmother's it's in her head, and they said well whatever this is we want more of it so I've been involved in the community for since I've been there. And they've been eating and I've been talking to them about what's coming and they're very excited.

[Speaker 1] (2:26:38 - 2:26:40)
I'm excited for you.

[Speaker 8] (2:26:40 - 2:26:41)
Thank you. I hope you come.

[Speaker 1] (2:26:42 - 2:26:49)
Let me say this hat up on the roof. Is that going to be allowed under zoning or they have to get a special use.

[Speaker 43] (2:26:50 - 2:26:51)
Yeah, they're aware of that.

[Speaker 1] (2:26:52 - 2:26:54)
Okay. And I'm sorry, any parking.

[Speaker 8] (2:26:55 - 2:27:18)
Yes, I'm working with several parking lots now for valet parking, and we are on North Avenue so there's parking on. Okay. Hopefully high end keeps high end, you know, just try to get people in there you know I don't think so.

I don't know the top. Yeah, it's a it's I've been in business and it's hard. Yeah, yeah, it is.

[Speaker 1] (2:27:18 - 2:27:44)
All right. Other questions, comments. Hearing none, I have a motion to move do pass by the same roll call it was used to determine quorum, that would be by Alderman Kaplan.

Any objections to his motion. Hearing none. The item is passed.

Thank you. Good luck. Thank you so much.

All right. Top of page 10. I'm sorry did I miss one.

[Speaker 48] (2:27:44 - 2:27:44)

Oh, I guess he. Okay. All right.

So, there was a motion to defer this item by all the men walk us back. Can I get a motion to support that Alderman bill makes that motion any objections to the Alderman's deferral hearing none the item will be deferred. Right.

So now, top page 10 document number two to 042 in the 38th Ward ordinance was referred on December 14 of 2022. Common address is 3339 North Ottawa Avenue, and the change request from an RS to residential single unit detached house district to an RT 3.5 residential two flat townhouse and multi unit district. We did have a speaker that was opposed to that.

These were the neighbors that you heard from. So hopefully we'll be able to address some of their concerns. We have Matt Ali on this map.

[Speaker 23] (2:29:19 - 2:30:51)
Thank you, Chairman. Good afternoon Chairman Tony and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Matthew Ali and attorney with the law firm of Shane Banks Kenny and Schwartz, on behalf of the applicant Royal Millennium LLC.

Joining me today is Danny Vegas, the owner and manager of the applicant LLC. The applicant purchased the property, located at 3339 North Ottawa Avenue in July, 2018, with the hopes of redeveloping the property for a family residence with to redevelop the property to. Yes, correct yeah demolish the existing structure and and with new construction, establish a family residence with two stories to dwelling units and to off street parking spaces.

The applicant will live on the second floor, and his aging mother will live on the ground floor unit, where they can provide both assistance and autonomy for his mother. In order to facilitate the proposed development, we've applied for a zoning change from the current RS to to RT 3.5. Prior to filing this application, the project team worked closely with Alderman Sposato his office and conducted extensive outreach to the neighbors on the 3300 block of North Ottawa. Through this outreach we obtained the support of the vast majority of nearby neighbors, including both immediately adjacent neighbors to the subject property.

With such neighborhood support Alderman Sposato has provided a letter of support for this zoning change application, which has been shared with the committee for your reference. Chairman in light of the opposition from the two public speakers that live on the adjacent block to the east. At this time, the applicant would like to provide a very brief statement.

[Speaker 1] (2:30:51 - 2:30:52)
All right.

[Speaker 35] (2:30:52 - 2:31:42)
Hi, my name is Danny Vegas, and I am the owner of the property. With this zoning change, my intention is to demolish the existing property and build a two-story house, a two-story dwelling unit where my family and I will live. I will live on the top floor with my son and my mother and my sister will live on the bottom ground floor.

This will allow our family to provide necessary support. This would allow me to provide necessary support to my mother while keeping her close to me. I indicated to my attorney we spoke with many of our neighbors to provide approval with adjacent neighbors to the left and to the right approving this and I work with Alderman for his approval.

I appreciate the committee's consideration of this application and would request your support.

[Speaker 49] (2:31:42 - 2:31:44)
All right.

[Speaker 4] (2:31:44 - 2:31:52)
So you heard from the, the neighbors that live on oil. Correct.

[Speaker 1] (2:31:53 - 2:32:16)
And they're insistent on single family home, we get the idea of co generation multi in the same household. Your immediate neighbors are fine with it. Correct.

Matt, have you done a study on the block is it, it will this be the first of two plot in the area or what this.

[Speaker 23] (2:32:16 - 2:32:33)
I can't speak to multi family, maybe maybe Danny can I did survey the block there are already existing structures that are two stories in height and so the bulk of the property will not be out of character. Danny do you know other multifamily buildings on the block.

[Speaker 35] (2:32:33 - 2:32:50)
No, I really can't tell you that but what I can say is that the size is, it's, it's, it's going to remain relevant to the other houses are in the surrounding area and in the same block. The only thing that we're changing is I want to live with my mother in the same house but not together, as I have a child that I.

[Speaker 23] (2:32:52 - 2:33:18)
And Mr Chairman, I guess, let me just reiterate as well as part of all of us because I was process. Danny knocked on the doors of his neighbors on the 3300 block of North Audible we have 20 letters of support. Those are provided to the alderman, which led to his letter of support submitted to the committee.

We're taking a property that has has seen better days and looking to reinvigorate that property with some new construction that will benefit the neighborhood.

[Speaker 1] (2:33:19 - 2:33:29)
And just the last question. How, how is where in proximity is Oriole to Ottawa.

[Speaker 4] (2:33:30 - 2:33:33)
It is the, it's the block immediately to the east.

[Speaker 1] (2:33:34 - 2:33:41)
So, you might want to talk to Jane and we I spoke to Miss sneak.

[Speaker 23] (2:33:41 - 2:33:44)
About a week ago, I know. She also spoke to the alderman.

[Speaker 1] (2:33:44 - 2:33:47)
Well she made it. They both made an effort to come down and I appreciate that.

[Speaker 23] (2:33:48 - 2:33:49)
Absolutely. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:33:49 - 2:33:57)
Other questions, comments. And I get a motion to move do pass on this item we do have a letter of support from Alderman Beal from Alderman spazzato.

[Speaker 4] (2:33:57 - 2:33:59)
We take it all day.

[Speaker 1] (2:34:00 - 2:34:16)
By the same roll call that was used to determine form. Any objections. Hearing none item is passed.

Thank you. All right, again, let's make sure you know that people might not be 100% satisfied but at least they're listening to the concerns.

[Speaker 4] (2:34:16 - 2:34:17)
Thank you. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:34:17 - 2:34:42)
All right. Next, middle of page 10 document number 22039 t one in the 43rd ward ordinance was referred on December 14 of 2022 and the common address 2573 to 2581 North Lincoln Avenue and the change request from B three three community shopping district to see two three motor vehicle related district.

[Speaker 4] (2:34:43 - 2:34:53)
Oh, and this is the diner. Salt and pepper. Okay.

All right.

[Speaker 1] (2:34:54 - 2:35:01)
Look at this, we have a whole. Sorry, one of the later items on the agenda, but let's start.

[Speaker 28] (2:35:01 - 2:36:31)
Good afternoon Mr Chairman members of the committee. My name is actually Brent with the law firm Tucker Ellis, I'm here on behalf of the applicant. Marigrow Inc social equity applicant looking to establish a dispensary at the subject site.

Because of the current zoning of the three they need to see zoning to be able to then go through the community process to, to achieve their dispensary application they have gone through a substantial, substantial community process already. They spent the time to engage with the automatic office and Mr Taylor Nessie from the 43rd ward will speak to that shortly. We have also engaged with the right would neighbor association.

We have engaged with the Lincoln Park Chamber of Commerce, and I believe we have letters of support from the Lincoln Park Chamber of Commerce a letter of no opposition from the right would neighbor association and a suitable letter of no opposition from the alderman's office. I have with me here today. Jamie Magala, the architect for the project.

Akilah Parnell, the CEO of Marigrow Inc and also a member of Cola. The Cola Enterprises Cola group, a social equity operator that actually runs the current dispensary nature's care out on West Randolph, and Mr Gary little, who is the CEO of the Cola group who is actually in charge of running the nature's care and will also be running this facility. I happily take any questions I'd also like Mr Nessie to speak to the automatic process that we've been through your Taylor right from 43.

[Speaker 1] (2:36:32 - 2:36:40)
All right. Good afternoon, as a neighboring alderman I know that there's been a lot of talk about this. So I'd be interested to see the community process.

[Speaker 25] (2:36:41 - 2:38:33)
Yeah, so this process started under alderman Michelle Smith in October 2021. At the time we were approached by three different applicants for different locations within the 43rd war to open up dispensaries. It was alderman Smith's wish that if any dispensaries to open in the 43rd war that it would be a social equity applicants.

This particular applicant was the only one who fit that criteria. So she permitted them to continue along in the process. After initial intake meetings with alderman Smith, the applicant was did their due diligence to meet with the community group, the Chamber of Commerce, the local precinct of CPD, and upon her retirement in August of 2022, the process kind of got a little deferred but under alderman In November 1, we hosted a community community meeting with right with neighbors Association.

And since then have been soliciting and collecting feedback with the neighborhood association and we've received far too many over 200 I think community submissions of comment. It's been a mix of opposition and support I will say for the record that the majority of the opposing comments have been with matters pertaining more to the special use and business operation side of things and particularly the zoning change and I will state for alderman part that we deferred to right with neighbors Association in this and they issued a letter of no opposition, just a few weeks ago.

We follow their lead and we also state that are no opposition to this moving forward is strictly with regards to the zoning map amendment. The special use permit necessary for a cannabis dispensary will have to undergo further community review with the ZBA and the neighborhood association. And we fully expected the applicant will comply with that process and do their due diligence as well in the continued review process.

[Speaker 4] (2:38:35 - 2:38:42)
So, all I mean Knudsen is no objection objection. Okay. Questions.

[Speaker 1] (2:38:43 - 2:38:55)
Okay, so obviously the zoning is step one and the zoning board of appeals is so there'll be there'll be more comment but I do know I'm familiar with the location. How long has this been vacant.

[Speaker 25] (2:38:56 - 2:38:59)
The last tenant vacated the building in 2015.

[Speaker 1] (2:39:00 - 2:39:17)
It's a good, good corner, and you obviously through the zoning Board of Appeals, you'll figure out the security plan the loading and yeah they've already the applicant has already submitted a preliminary security plan with CPD and has been reviewed and found suitable will continue to hammer that out with the community group.

[Speaker 25] (2:39:18 - 2:39:26)
The applicant is also committed to streetscape improvements and working with the Chamber of Commerce for under, it's right next to the L track so under our lighting improvements and security and so forth.

[Speaker 4] (2:39:29 - 2:39:34)
All right. Question. All the men deal.

Thank you, Mr Chairman.

[Speaker 9] (2:39:35 - 2:39:43)
I just have a few questions for the social equity applicant, are you 100% owner of this organization.

[Speaker 1] (2:39:45 - 2:39:46)
I know I'm not yourself.

[Speaker 20] (2:39:47 - 2:40:19)
Hey, my name is Akili Parnell I'm the CEO of Marigrow Inc. So no I'm not the 100% owner but is 100% minority on. I'm sorry, it's 100% minority owned among different individuals, but how many individuals, it's like five, five, and who are the five.

So it's, it's myself, Keena oil or Ricardo is her father is a social equity qualifying individual track until Keelan Patel and Kimmy Almeida. You say Patel. Yeah, track Patel and Kayla Patel and then a Kimmy Almeida who's also social equity.

[Speaker 9] (2:40:19 - 2:40:25)
So, these are not African Americans. No, no, those two aren't. Okay.

What's their percentage.

[Speaker 20] (2:40:26 - 2:40:32)
I think they may like 20% 20% each. Come by.

[Speaker 9] (2:40:32 - 2:40:35)
Okay, who holds the majority share of the, the social equity Ricardo.

[Speaker 4] (2:40:36 - 2:40:40)
And they are African American. Yeah, he's like, yeah. Okay.

All right.

[Speaker 9] (2:40:44 - 2:40:46)
Okay, and how's this all being funded.

[Speaker 20] (2:40:47 - 2:41:04)
So I mean part of it is, you know, bootstrapping, like our individual capital we've been an industry doing social equity work for since the beginning of legalization. So definitely encourage you to legalization here in Chicago and Illinois or absolutely as Chicago nationwide but Chicago.

[Speaker 9] (2:41:04 - 2:41:09)
Okay, so is what percentage of the applicants are from Chicago.

[Speaker 20] (2:41:10 - 2:41:15)
I mean, all of them. I'm the only one that's not born in Chicago, but I've been here since 2008.

[Speaker 4] (2:41:15 - 2:41:18)
Okay. Okay.

[Speaker 9] (2:41:20 - 2:41:36)
Mr Chairman if I can through the chair, get a total breakdown of all the percentage breakdown of all the funding. All the partners, their percentage and their funding part of the project and what's the total price of the project as a whole.

[Speaker 20] (2:41:36 - 2:41:56)
Well, I mean we only have estimates because we can't fully price it out until we get the zoning approvals because you know we spend money on architects and everything but I mean we ballpark. Yeah, the one ballpark is probably a million dollars to build it out and then op ex probably another million to run it, you know and cover inventory for four to six months that'd be like ideal.

[Speaker 9] (2:41:57 - 2:42:00)
Okay, so are you going to be hands on running the operation.

[Speaker 20] (2:42:00 - 2:42:02)
Yeah, 100% so you want to try.

[Speaker 38] (2:42:02 - 2:42:12)
Yeah, Gary little. Again, Gary little is my name from call the group, and I've run the nature's care operation in the West loop for two years and nine months.

[Speaker 9] (2:42:13 - 2:42:22)
So I'll be running the operations as a social equity partner as a social equity partner for holdings. So that other location it was that also a social equity.

[Speaker 38] (2:42:24 - 2:42:38)
No, it's actually run by a multi state operator but we have community benefits agreement that compels us to make sure that we're operating in a social equity based way. So 90% of our staff is a people of color.

[Speaker 9] (2:42:39 - 2:42:46)
Okay, so, so we have a non social equity partner that's going to run the facility that what I'm hearing.

[Speaker 20] (2:42:46 - 2:43:26)
So, definitely would encourage you to speak with Alderman Burnett about this too because he was the ones that helped us get this position so basically it was a non social equity business that already had the license these existing medical operators. This is in the very beginning of legalization, and through me working with some community organizations and Gary were able to get enough leverage for us to get experience in the industry and make some money by running this dispensary for this other business and, you know, they felt that if they had a social equity partner they'd be more likely, you know, to get support in the zoning process through Alderman Burnett.

So we were one of the fortunate teams to be black operators in the beginning of legalization when they were zero.

[Speaker 1] (2:43:29 - 2:43:30)
To the mic.

[Speaker 28] (2:43:31 - 2:43:45)
Again, I don't have an event exercise because his influence to help my clients achieve and be able to be a socially equity operator for a non social equity owner, otherwise, they would not have had the opportunity to get the experience you need.

[Speaker 38] (2:43:47 - 2:44:23)
So, identify yourself Gary little call the group. We were partners with English holdings, and we had an 80% 20% deal with those guys when we did our application. We did not win any licenses, but they still said hey look we need you to stand up our facility in the West loop.

So basically from nothing to alter the ZBA all through any other board that we had to go through to get it done. I was the person to help get it done one with Achille Brunel so like I said before we've spent two years nine months, basically, owning or operating a facility in the West loop. Okay.

[Speaker 9] (2:44:23 - 2:45:32)
Just for the record, my, my big concern with the social applicants is that, you know, I'm not saying that you guys are but a lot of my friends and their friends for the other applicants. And, you know, we really need to get to the bottom and I think the state did a very poor job of making sure that a lot of the shenanigans can happen with the social equity applicants and, but it is happening. And, and so my antennas are up and I'm going to be watching each one of these social equities applicants that come through to make sure that they are not fronts and if they are we're going to expose them for who they are.

And so, you know, the African American community was affected by the war on drugs more than anybody else, and we're getting the pennies on the share when it comes down to our share of this whole industry. And so be careful, because I think they're going to set a lot of people up to fail. And they're going to try to squeeze you and they're gonna try to buy you out and, you know, the whole gamut so proceed with caution and I wish you all the best of luck.

[Speaker 42] (2:45:33 - 2:45:33)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:45:35 - 2:45:36)
Alderman David Moore.

[Speaker 29] (2:45:36 - 2:45:49)
Thank you, Chairman, I have no idea that Alderman René has done his due diligence but just so I can be clear, what's the ownership portion, I missed it somehow.

[Speaker 20] (2:45:50 - 2:45:51)
So the ownership portion it's...

[Speaker 1] (2:45:51 - 2:45:52)
Identify yourself.

[Speaker 20] (2:45:52 - 2:46:02)
Oh yeah, my name is Akili Parnell. It's at least 70% black owned, for sure. When you say at least 70% why don't we know the exact...

[Speaker 29] (2:46:02 - 2:46:03)
We're going to get there.

[Speaker 20] (2:46:03 - 2:46:09)
Because there's like sometimes it's like 1% I don't want to say it's 70 and it's like, okay, but I mean it's majority is black owned and run.

[Speaker 29] (2:46:09 - 2:46:11)
Give me the number again is it so is it 70%?

[Speaker 4] (2:46:12 - 2:46:33)
Yeah, so it's like 66.45. Okay. Yeah, 65.45. Okay, so how many... Actually so yeah.

All right.

[Speaker 1] (2:46:34 - 2:46:41)
Anything else because we're going to get the information through the chair to the committee members at the request of Alderman Beal.

[Speaker 29] (2:46:41 - 2:46:46)
Oh, so he requested all of it break down already? Okay then. All right, I hear that.

Thank you Alderman Beal.

[Speaker 1] (2:46:48 - 2:46:51)
Yeah. Can we, I know we've been emailing...

[Speaker 29] (2:46:51 - 2:46:52)
It's right here, it's in the...

[Speaker 1] (2:46:52 - 2:46:59)
Just email to Nicole or Raymond and then we can get it to the committee. Okay.

[Speaker 29] (2:46:59 - 2:47:03)
All right, David. No, that's it if Alderman Beal requested that exact information...

[Speaker 1] (2:47:03 - 2:47:05)
We'll have it to you before the end of day.

[Speaker 4] (2:47:06 - 2:47:13)
Tomorrow is the... All right. Any other questions, comments?

[Speaker 1] (2:47:15 - 2:47:46)
If not, can I get a motion to move do pass the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Alderman David Moore makes the motion, any objections to the motion? Hearing none, the item is passed.

It's passed. Okay. Thank you.

Good luck. I know you got... It's only halftime in this thing.

Okay. All right. Bottom of page 10.

I'm going to yield the chairman's seat to my vice chair because this item is in the 44th ward.

[Speaker 4] (2:47:47 - 2:48:03)
Vice Chair Arroyo. Okay. Document number 22056-T1 in the 44th ward, referred on December 14, 2022.

[Speaker 17] (2:48:05 - 2:48:18)
Common address 453-55 West Briar Place. A change request is RM5 residential multi-unit district to an RM6 residential multi-unit district.

[Speaker 4] (2:48:22 - 2:48:23)
Councilor Thomas Moore.

[Speaker 13] (2:48:24 - 2:48:51)
Thank you, Alderman Roboyas. Preliminarily, this has gone through a community process, and we've had our assistant designer, Alderman Tunney, help us. And so it went through many changes.

And so we have a substitute narrative and plans, and if we could please do that.

[Speaker 17] (2:48:51 - 2:49:04)
Can we get a substitute narrative move by Kaplan to accept the substitute narrative and plans for the type one application by the same roll call used to determine quorum? Hearing none, you may proceed.

[Speaker 13] (2:49:04 - 2:50:02)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is a vacant lot in a building that was a problem in the neighborhood with basically kind of a group living home unofficially. And the applicants came to the Alderman and have had many discussions with him and many redesigns, and then have gone through the Southeast Lakeview Neighbors Association process and had two significant meetings with them and adopted many of their suggested changes.

With me today is Jeff Goulet, who is the primary architect on the matter. And after all these changes we now have the support of the Alderman, and we request your support as well. Alderman Tunney.

[Speaker 1] (2:50:04 - 2:50:12)
Thank you, Mr. Moore. Just for the record. What were some of the changes that the Alderman was so rough and tumble about.

[Speaker 13] (2:50:12 - 2:50:51)
Well, for one thing, it started out as a six story building and it's now a five story building. And the design at one point was too bulky and too imposing and didn't pick up all of the design attributes of the community that would help it fit in. And so there were lots of changes that now it much better reflects the existing 1920s kind of atmosphere of the block and fits right into the neighborhood.

[Speaker 1] (2:50:51 - 2:51:03)
I know we spent some time on it. It did not, for the record, it did not get the support of Southeast Lakeview Neighbors.

[Speaker 13] (2:51:03 - 2:51:12)
Well, it had a mixed support. And depending on how you count the votes, it was a tie. They let spouses vote for their people.

[Speaker 1] (2:51:12 - 2:51:33)
All right, all right, enough for the committee. But that being said, there's quite a bit this is a very dense block. In some cases, across the street there's 28 stories there's four plus ones there's whatever this is nine, nine units eight units, eight units.

Eight parking spaces I believe.

[Speaker 13] (2:51:33 - 2:51:35)
There's 12 parking spaces.

[Speaker 1] (2:51:35 - 2:52:15)
So, that being said, I think part of this R6 is to make sure that you can do the one, you can do the parking right. Okay, because there's no alley and so I just want to make sure that people understand why we went to R6 which is pretty high, but there's a lot of R6 on the block too. So, with that compromises some changes.

I am in support of this project. I think it's going to be a great addition new construction on this block I don't think it's bad for many many years. So I'm excited about the design and thank you for working with our office, and it has my support.

[Speaker 4] (2:52:15 - 2:52:31)
Any questions or comments. I'll make a motion. Unless there's any other questions, or any hanging chads that Mr. Murphy has a motion to pass.

[Speaker 17] (2:52:32 - 2:52:40)
I guess most do pass the same role called determined quorum. Any objections, if not this item is passed. Thank you.

Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (2:52:41 - 2:53:06)
All right. Thank you, Scott. Let me see.

Top of page 11 in the 47th ward document number 22049. The address is 4861 North Hermitage Avenue and the change request RS three residential single unit detached house district to an RT for residential two flat townhouse and multi unit district again we have Mr. Tom Moore.

[Speaker 13] (2:53:06 - 2:53:58)
Thank you, Mr Chairman and members of the committee, my name for the record is Tom Moore. This is very interesting because we started out. Originally, not not officially in filing here but in the community, we're going to do the old RTA to make the to afford to have assess accessible units through the alderman's process and the community process.

And in the meantime, the, the, there was a change in the ordinance that we could now do this with an RT for, but the alderman's office actually wanted us. If we would make half of the units, eight units, half of them, four of them would be fully. Type A accessible.

And so we agreed to that. And with that we have the ultimate support and we'd request your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (2:53:59 - 2:54:13)
Okay, questions comments from committee members. Hearing none. Alderman Kaplan makes a motion to move do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum any objections.

Hearing on the items past.

[Speaker 13] (2:54:13 - 2:54:14)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (2:54:14 - 2:54:36)
Next, middle of page 11 document number two to 060 T one in the 45th Ward ordinance was referred on December 14 of 2022 and the common address 5940 to 5960 West Lawrence Avenue, and the change request from B one to neighborhood shopping district to be three one community shopping district, all whole pack on the item in 45.

[Speaker 45] (2:54:36 - 2:55:22)
Good afternoon, Mr Chairman members of the committee. My name is Paul Kopec I represent the applicant on this property. The property is currently zone B one dash two we're requesting as you mentioned to that changes only to be three dash one type one property was formally used as a deli.

It was been out of business for approximately a year. My client put it under contract we met with the community group to establish a coin operated laundromat there. There's 11 parking spaces to community group.

We're in favor of this change. Subsequently, all the men in the gardener I believe has sent a letter of support for this property, we do have a letter of support from Alderman Gardner questions comments.

[Speaker 1] (2:55:23 - 2:55:27)
Just quick comment, who's running this laundromat.

[Speaker 45] (2:55:27 - 2:55:44)
Oh, my client is Mr bank he's had, he's got four other laundromats in the city and that was presented to the community. They wanted an operator. He has a staff people who are there so that there won't be loitering that was part of the consideration to the community.

[Speaker 1] (2:55:45 - 2:56:03)
Right. Well, they know what can happen if it's not attended. That's correct.

All right. Any questions comments. Otherwise Alderman Beal makes a motion to move do pass by the same roll call it was used to determine quorum objections to that hearing on the item is passed.

[Speaker 45] (2:56:04 - 2:56:05)
Thank you everybody be healthy be safe.

[Speaker 4] (2:56:05 - 2:56:15)
All right, bottom of page. 11. Oh, okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:56:16 - 2:56:42)
Let's read bottom of page 11 Dr number 21108 t one in the 20th board ordinance was referred on July 20 of 2022 chain or the common address 1515 through 1525 West 47th Street and 4701 through 4711 South Justine Street. The change request from B three to community shopping district to be three five community shopping district.

[Speaker 5] (2:56:43 - 2:58:43)
Amy person, honorable chair members of the committee and I'm Amy person from the law firm of areas person, I have with me today Jose Duarte and also Aaron Wiesner to the principles of this project they're available only for questions we don't need to provide testimony other than the testimony that I'll present to you. This is a project that's part of the mayor's invest Southwest initiative, this development team began working on the project, nearly two years ago. The, this project that we have in front of you is the first two cases is a property that will be rezoned up to a dash five district to allow just a little bit of extra floor area ratio to enable the project to proceed.

It's 45 units that have 100% affordable and some of those units are actually going to be at a price point that is targeted to be affordable to this particular community, there'll be an opportunity hub on the first floor which is essentially a place to attract people from the neighborhood so they can get job and technology training. The property will have 19 parking spaces will also seek an allowance from the department to reduce the required parking because this is a transit served location will seek a few other allowances including variations for rear yard open space rear yard setbacks and variations are sorry, administrative adjustments from the zoning administrator. We're proud to say that we have a letter of support from Alderman Taylor, and that we did go through her very robust community process we had a variety of opportunities for the community to comment, including to community meetings that the Alderman put on.

We did not receive any opposition to either of those community meetings. So, we're pleased to report that we believe that the community supports this project, and happy to report that the Alderman has given her support as well.

[Speaker 1] (2:58:44 - 2:58:49)
We do have a letter of support from Alderman Taylor, questions, comments.

[Speaker 4] (2:58:50 - 2:58:51)
Yeah, Alderman Beal.

[Speaker 9] (2:58:52 - 2:59:09)
Mr. Chairman, I just have one quick question, and it's, you know, basically, to piggyback on the Tribune article. Is this within the boundaries of the invest Southwest or is it adjacent to the invest Southwest boundaries.

[Speaker 5] (2:59:09 - 2:59:34)
The subject property is a city of Chicago, at this time a city of Chicago owned parking lot that was offered as part of invest Southwest as part of that program, the city had a robust request for proposals process. This development team was selected by DPD to purchase the land and to go forward with the development which is consistent with what they told DPD they would build if they were selected.

[Speaker 9] (2:59:34 - 2:59:40)
Okay. That was a great answer. Didn't get to the bottom of mine.

[Speaker 5] (2:59:40 - 2:59:41)
I guess within the boundaries.

[Speaker 9] (2:59:41 - 2:59:44)
Within the boundaries. Okay, and how much is this costing.

[Speaker 1] (2:59:47 - 2:59:50)
Let's identify whoever is going to answer the question.

[Speaker 5] (2:59:50 - 2:59:55)
Let's answer that on the basis of how much will the construction cost. Put that fine point on it.

[Speaker 27] (2:59:55 - 3:00:09)
Yeah, the construction costs are Jose Duarte from Blackwood Group also partner co developer of the United Yards team. The construction for the for the Justine building is right now, about $27 million.

[Speaker 9] (3:00:10 - 3:00:13)
Okay. And so is this privately funded.

[Speaker 5] (3:00:15 - 3:00:44)
No, the city of Chicago is offering some TIF assistance but it's a very complex property redevelopment of a long corridor that the property redevelopment includes I believe six properties. And so there is some TIF that will be contributed by the city. Let me just say that there will also be a variety of tax credits and other incentives that are provided because this is 100% affordable.

It's impossible to do that without government assistance.

[Speaker 9] (3:00:45 - 3:00:47)
Okay, so we don't know how much tip you're going to be asking for.

[Speaker 5] (3:00:48 - 3:00:51)
I believe Aaron Weisner can answer that question.

[Speaker 26] (3:00:51 - 3:01:22)
Hello Aaron Weisner, Celadon Partners. So approximately 40% of our financing would come from the TIF district for the Justine facility. The overall project will be closer to 30% of total financing that includes some of the other properties that we'll be discussing next.

Alderman Beal, just go back to your question about being in the TIF zone. The intersection of 47th and Ashland is one of the 12 targeted invest Southwest corridors and all the sites we're discussing are within it.

[Speaker 9] (3:01:23 - 3:01:38)
Okay, well 30% or 40% is still a lot to be subsidized by the city of Chicago. You know, that's a huge undertaking. And does that TIF support that or are you looking to port money in from other TIFs?

[Speaker 5] (3:01:38 - 3:02:02)
I believe that this is a pay as you go, and I don't think they're porting money. There's an expectation, it's a redevelopment that includes multiple properties along 47th Street, also along Marshfield, also along Ashland. So we believe that the total property will generate enough revenue over time for the pay as you go.

[Speaker 9] (3:02:03 - 3:02:07)
Okay, and what's the commercial part of this development?

[Speaker 5] (3:02:07 - 3:02:21)
On the first floor, it's a not-for-profit opportunity hub. Essentially, the idea is that this will afford technology training to people from the community who want to participate in that kind of job training.

[Speaker 9] (3:02:21 - 3:02:25)
Okay, so we have no commercial tenants other than a not-for-profit?

[Speaker 5] (3:02:26 - 3:02:43)
Not at this property, not at the Justine and 47th Street property. There are tenants in some of the other properties. We have another rezoning to tell about after this next project, and there's a property in the middle of these two that has a commercial tenant.

[Speaker 9] (3:02:43 - 3:02:45)
Okay, and who is that commercial tenant?

[Speaker 5] (3:02:46 - 3:02:48)
Let me refer these questions to Aaron Weisner.

[Speaker 26] (3:02:50 - 3:04:11)
Thank you again, Aaron Weisner, Solid On Partners. So there's two components of this development. There's a residential component that's funded primarily by low-income housing tax credits, and then a new markets tax credit transaction that's going to be primarily at the intersection of 47th and Ashland and also at Marshfield and 47th.

The tenants are going to be a federally qualified health center. Friend Health is going to be the tenant there for about half of what was formerly a gold-black department store. They're getting about 15,000 square feet.

Then there's going to be about 10,000 square feet of small business space provided to five different tenants that are all locally owned, minority-owned small businesses, led actually by one of the other respondents to this RFP. Alderwoman Taylor had brought us together to collaborate on a proposal together, so that's going to be called Back of the Yards Works. It's more than a business incubator.

The concept is ownership for those small businesses for that retail space. There's also a new construction development that's going to be at the corner of Marshfield and 47th that is going to be really an administrative space for Back of the Yards Works, but also a collective brewery run by Back of the Yards Works and a few other local nonprofits. It'll be a commercial enterprise, but locally run by local businesses.

[Speaker 5] (3:04:13 - 3:04:21)
The matter of the redevelopment agreement for the TIF was presented to the Community Development Commission last week and passed that.

[Speaker 9] (3:04:21 - 3:04:31)
It sounds like the heavy use of residential is going to be looking to subsidize this entire development. Is that what I'm hearing?

[Speaker 4] (3:04:33 - 3:04:47)
Residential and the FQHC provides a pretty strong market level per square foot rent. Scott, do you have anything on this one?

[Speaker 1] (3:04:48 - 3:04:51)
It's going to come obviously in front of your committee, I think, at some point.

[Speaker 40] (3:04:54 - 3:05:02)
Thank you, Chairman. Alderman Beal's questions were, I think, well pointed, and we'll probably have further discussion on it when we get into the Committee on Finance.

[Speaker 1] (3:05:02 - 3:05:11)
I appreciate the answers from the applicants. So there are 45 residential units, 19 parking spaces.

[Speaker 5] (3:05:11 - 3:05:11)
Yes, sir.

[Speaker 1] (3:05:13 - 3:05:58)
All right. Any other questions or comments? Can I get a motion to move to pass by the same roll call?

I think Alderman Raboios made the motion to move to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections at this point? None?

Hearing none, the item is passed. From a zoning perspective. All right.

Page 12, document number 21109-T1. Again, in the 20th Ward. This is adjacent to it, I believe, maybe close to it.

1641 West 47th Street. Change request, B13, Neighborhood Shopping District to C13, Neighborhood Commercial District. This is Amy Kersan again, and I think we've talked a little bit about this.

[Speaker 5] (3:05:59 - 3:08:14)
Honorable Chair and members of the committee, Amy Kersan from the Law Firm of Reyes-Kersan. I am here again with Jose Duarte and Aaron Wisner on behalf of the development team that is redeveloping the property at 47th Street and Marshfield. This particular property also is part of the Invest Southwest redevelopment initiative.

The subject property before you today is on the hard corner of 47th and Marshfield. And on the properties that are on the south of this on Marshfield, we already took those to the Zoning Board of Appeals. Do you have those properties approved for first floor residential uses?

So this will be adjacent to some residential properties, residential buildings that are just to the south. This particular property will be redeveloped into a brewery and brew pub, which is the reason that we're asking for the upzoning to the C3 district to allow that brewery and brew pub. We will also have to go back to the Zoning Board of Appeals to ask for special uses for an outdoor patio for any rooftop patio uses.

In as much as that this will be a facility that serves alcohol, we have already done our due diligence with the Liquor Control Commissioner to inquire about whether it's a suitable location for licensing. And it is notwithstanding the presence of a school which is far enough away that it will not disqualify the use of the property for a brewery or a pub. Again, we have a letter of support from Alder Taylor.

I'll just repeat for the record that we did go through her robust community process. We had a, out on site we put up a tent and welcomed the community to come and talk about the development last summer. We also went through a robust community hearing process that included online meetings, one online community meeting, and also a combined online and personal in person community meeting we did not receive any opposition to either of those meetings.

And I'm pleased to say that we were able to secure a letter of support from Alder Taylor, which I believe has been transmitted to the committee, we do have a letter of support from all the woman Taylor questions.

[Speaker 4] (3:08:16 - 3:08:17)
All of in Vegas.

[Speaker 32] (3:08:18 - 3:09:50)
Mr. Chairman, not so much a question just more of a comment about how it appears that finally this invest Southwest is getting close to groundbreaking is is talking to the, to the team that they have a very aggressive schedule to get projects up and running starting in spring and then hopefully starting the other projects in the summertime. And do appreciate the fact that when you're taking a look at this, this, this area. And I've driven past there because I wanted to see the old goblets because there's one in the north side and one on the south side there, and saw how challenging it is to redevelop these types of old buildings that are just just monstrosities and so the fact that they're doing a mix of FQHC commercial as well as residential I think sounds speaks to the fact that the developer and his team are very creative and repurposing this property. I would say that it's unfortunate that these projects take a long time to come to fruition. As we see the, the interest rates have have moved up property.

I'm sorry, supply chain issues, the price of construction goes up so we hope that the way that the funding stack is that they're able to make ends meet. And, and fortunately in this area here there are no subsidies that this project qualifies for. So I want to congratulate the team for for taking a taking a gamble on this corridor.

I hope that these projects actually do come to fruition and it continues to spur economic development this area. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:09:50 - 3:10:04)
All right, thank you all in Vegas. From an operational point of view, what's the experience of this group hub. We have a group of right.

Yes, who's doing that part.

[Speaker 27] (3:10:04 - 3:11:06)
Who said what different blackboard group. So, this portion of the blue pub is again the the merger of the two teams that came together for this RFP so this group hub is headed by a local group that's a local micro brewery working, basically, you know, locally, out of, you know, their home establishment and rented pop up establishments in the community. So they're looking for a home.

The name of the operators called so most models and their local sorry you would so most models, you know, so most models. Okay, so, so I have experience I mean they're yes row into this they're doing this currently, this is a big, they're doing this a lot of money in this thing. Yes, they're doing this currently and and basically one of the reasons why they've partnered.

Why our teams came together is because they needed that financial assistance and support to structure a deal to put this together so that these local community entrepreneur entrepreneurs would have a local home, and a place of operation in the community.

[Speaker 1] (3:11:06 - 3:11:11)

Lewis Weinstock for cheese say LLC attorney for them, along with me is a record of who is the member and one of the owners of the owner, LLC LLC along with Sam margarine architect of the project. This property, because it had been in the industrial court or the Department of Planning and Development of the city. On December 12 of last year, approved the recommended zoning change today to go for from the manufacturing district, the m three three to be two three.

What's proposed is a new three story three unit residential building, which is in between two other ones a lot is between two other similar buildings and the neighborhood has gone in that direction that is why we believe that this should be approved and I also think Alderman Burnett has sent a letter of support. This past week for the project. Yeah, we have received.

[Speaker 1] (3:14:50 - 3:15:18)
Oh, we have to go to plan. Oh, okay so before we.
