[Speaker 13] (48:07 - 48:08)
I need that book for Zash.

[Speaker 2] (48:11 - 48:23)
How old is she? 19 months this week. Yes.

It's a blast. I don't know where all the women play live.

[Speaker 13] (48:26 - 48:28)
Oh, yeah, I'm sure Eric's on it.

[Speaker 2] (48:32 - 57:13)
I believe these gentlemen are signing up. Go for it. Go for it, yes.

Yeah. I'm going to ask them real quick. Okay.

I'll try and get to the part I need to get to, give me just a minute. Thank you. Thank you.

You're welcome. You need to get to 10? What was 10?

One thing. And this meeting was supposed to start at 1230. Too much.

Too much. Mr. Graymore. I can't change this.

I want to, but I can't. Y'all better come up and get my piece, Chris. Thank you.

This is too much, too much. This meeting was supposed to start at 12.30, 1.30 now. They got two meetings going on at the same time.

It's sad. It is simply sad. You know, I think it would be beautiful if we could be kind enough to be loud and talk about the low-life public officials.

To give me a chance to talk about these low-life public officials. Low-life! Don't have two meetings at the same time, at the same place.

And each one of them are late. Simple. But you've got to understand, all of them are bad.

The black ones, the white ones, the Hispanics, all of them. All the years, I've never seen Chicago like this. Never.

Never! But these people are starting on black folks' time. What?

Black folks? Never on time. You like me?

White folks are not either. I'm playing the race card. What's wrong with me playing that card?

It's a debt to me. Landmark is still the same. That's why they want to always put you out.

Call the police on him. He's loud. He's disruptive.

Drag him out. Help! Help!

You can talk good. You can dress good. You can act good and be a piece of S.H.I. That's what this means. So do you end at the end of the sentence? Yes. The word at the end of the sentence.

You can speak good and still be a piece of S.H.I. It's essential. Two meetings at the same time. The same day.

I'm watching how this ends. George said, I don't care about waiting. She said, I'm being paid.

Time is money and money is time. How can they do this? No leadership.

You can't lay that on Brandon Johnson. You can't lay that on Lee Dalton. You know who you can lay it on?

The people in Chicago. That are loud. You're supposed to save your servants.

If you don't serve them. They get paid to serve you. So lay it on the machine.

All Democrats. Come down here Trump. Turn this around.

The system is broke. This is worse than communist China. For one point.

No more support. The check and balance. These people are out of control here.

You see them happy and green. They're out of control. Mr. Greg Norton is crazy. Like an old fox. Like an old fox. Uh-huh.

Big. Mr. Johnson is dreaming again. They're happy with it.

And you seem like you're happy with it. Because you're silent. If you're silent.

Sitting there trying to be sophisticated. Silent. It's betrayal.

Silent. That means you're okay with it. You're okay with it.

Okay. What are y'all waiting on? You've been playing on.

What are you waiting on? Look at the time. Look.

Time is money. Are you scared of them? Can't you see the bill?

Maybe y'all might know the bill. Look at. Look at.

Look at. Look. Are you waiting on them?

Folks.

[Speaker 1] (57:14 - 57:29)
Real quick. I just want to apologize for the delay. We're going to start in a few minutes.

We have a few members coming from another meeting. If I could ask everyone to take their seats, please. We'll start in just a minute.

Sir. Thank you.

[Speaker 2] (57:29 - 57:33)
I can stand up. This meeting hasn't started.

[Speaker 15] (57:37 - 57:46)
We want to thank everyone. That's correct. We want to thank everyone for enjoying the entertainment.

We have to take a donation. So, with the TV shows going on.

[Speaker 2] (57:47 - 57:56)
Tell your mama to take a donation for your mom. For your mom. That's not funny.

You're going to try to make me look like Max.

[Speaker 13] (57:57 - 57:58)
It's not funny.

[Speaker 2] (57:58 - 57:59)
I know it's not funny.

[Speaker 13] (58:02 - 58:29)
It's really not funny. There's a lot of stuff that's going on. That is happening.

Because you all are not doing. What you are. To do.

So, to make fun of Mr. Blakemore. Who is a pillar in the city of Chicago. That has been here forever.

Never been to jail. Never been arrested. None of that stuff.

Some of the aldermen. We know have gone.

[Speaker 2] (58:30 - 59:36)
To make fun of him. It is 128.

[Speaker 1] (59:38 - 1:00:43)
On April 9th. I'm sorry. Good afternoon.

as any others on zoom.

[Speaker 3] (1:01:12 - 1:01:13)
It looks like it's just us to.

[Speaker 1] (1:01:14 - 1:02:11)
All right, thank you. All right. All the person Fuentes makes the motion by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum to allow all those Harris and Ramirez to attend remotely.

Any objection? Here's hearing none. All those Harris and Ramirez are attending by remote means.

Welcome. All right, moving on. We have one deferral request to a date certain of April 16 2024.

No objection. The item is deferred to April 16. At this time, we will begin public comment period.

The public comment period will be limited to 30 minutes out of respect for everyone's time. Each speaker is limited to three minutes. We have a handful of public speakers.

We'll start with Mr. Blake more.

[Speaker 4] (1:02:12 - 1:05:41)
Thank you, Honorable Chairman. Awesome. I'm wanting you to be our chairman.

So you got to approach a person in certain ways. Thank you. The young lady said that we do have ex-convicts that are Altamans.

Anyway, I'm here specifically about our historical landmark, the Regal Theater, the jewel of the South Side. And the Altamans, Michelle Harris, have stopped this theater from being open and redevelopment. And I just think this is very disgraceful.

And we've gone so far that she's now, they're suing the Altamans and the city of Chicago. Something is evil here. Something is corrupt here.

Something is un-American here. The necessity that you had us to wait. We should never have to wait.

I'm going to look at each one of you. You work for the people. The people do not work for you.

Now, in a few minutes, he's going to ring a little bell. Ring your bell. And that means your time is up.

Well, we have spent a set quietly here waiting for this dog and pony show to start in an hour. But you're going to enforce that rule. Ring, ring, ring.

Your three minutes is up. It's time out for you all here. Never let that happen again.

But two meetings at the same time. Get back to the regal. With that lawsuit.

With Michelle Harris. Having another regal and then go get money. It's terrible here.

And what makes it very bad here is the one-party system. Now, when that bell, you go enforce the three-minute rule on the citizens. When the citizens have waited here an hour waiting on you to start this dog and pony show.

What you should come in and apologize. And if I extend the three minutes, you should be compassionate. Because you are the one that's supposed to serve us.

Serve us. And that's the capacity to talk to a man of my high caliber like you're doing. I am a citizen.

A legal citizen. Now, don't go there. And you had a dash to try to say, okay, we don't have a call, so we're going to go and let the public speak.

The public's entitled to speak to the call. You were completely out of order and out of control. Last time I was in here, you said I threatened a public official and that was a lie.

Don't go there. So, I'm going to be seated. But the death of this ex-convict to say something about me.

[Speaker 1] (1:05:41 - 1:05:44)
Thank you, Mr. Blakemore. Your time is up.

[Speaker 4] (1:05:44 - 1:05:45)
Yes, your time should be up.

[Speaker 1] (1:05:46 - 1:05:51)
Next up, we have Aaron Feldman, followed by Tim Cernan.

[Speaker 8] (1:06:00 - 1:08:24)
My name is Aaron Feldman. I'm a member of Strongtown Chicago. I'm here to advocate for the River North Outdoor Dining Program.

I was hoping Alderman Riley would be here. It seems that's not the case. So, hopefully, I can pass my information on to him.

But we're calling on Alderman Riley, Mayor Johnson, CDOT, and City Council to open up Clark Street between Kinsey and Grand. So, when Chicago opened up the street for pedestrians in the past, police saw increased safety, local businesses saw increased revenue, and residents saw the increase in community vibrancy that a pedestrian plaza could bring. So, this is an incredibly popular program, and we know this because when Strongtown launched a petition to reclaim Clark Street, it garnered over 1,000 signatures in 24 hours.

It's now at over 3,000 or close to 3,000. And in a survey of the 42nd Ward last year, 80% of respondents said they are strongly in favor of making it car-free. Despite this, it was recently announced that these permits would not be accepted for 2024, which was disappointing to hear.

I've read the tweets of Alderman Riley, both block club articles and both the streets blog interviews. So, when I hear the Council say that they support outdoor dining, I believe them. But all the unclear timelines of what was said between Alderman Riley, the Mayor, and City Council has been frustrating, and all the obfuscation leaves it unclear who is ultimately responsible for this decision.

I don't think Chicagoans care who's responsible, but we do care about reopening the street to pedestrians and closing it to cars. So, I ask all members of City Council, including Alderman Riley and the Mayor specifically, to work together to support outdoor dining, and I hope that we do this for the good of our city. Alderman Riley's not here, but I was going to give you my contact information so I can follow up with you on this matter and the 3,000 people who signed the petition.

Also, we're working to assemble three businesses to file an application for outdoor dining. I've already pored over the CDOT and CBAP websites and emailed, so we might need assistance. So, if Alderman Riley's office could provide guidance on how to file this, or even let us know which three restaurants filed the petition last year, that would go a long way in helping us achieve our goals of reopening the street to pedestrians.

Again, we've tried to contact y'all, but we haven't gotten any responses, which is why I'm here today. So, anyways, I hope we come together to support outdoor dining. Thanks again.

I want to pass off my email and phone number, and I'm hoping that this can be communicated to Alderman Riley. I'm trying to get a hold of him. So, yeah, thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:08:25 - 1:08:31)
Can I give this to somebody? Thank you, Mr. Feldman. We'll take it, and we'll give it to the Alderman.

Great.

[Speaker 16] (1:08:31 - 1:08:31)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:08:32 - 1:08:35)
Thank you. Next up is Timothy Cerny.

[Speaker 3] (1:08:43 - 1:12:16)
Good afternoon, Alderman Lawson and the other members of the committee. I'm here representing Aiden Donegan. This is on special ordinance I believe it's 17-12-1100, which is seeking to amend and add a new section, 17-12-1105, to allow the Chicago Cubs to have two signs on rooftops they own on Sheffield Avenue and Waveland Avenue.

And we're against that ordinance, not in the sense that we don't think there should be some advertising on rooftops, but not just for the Cubs. I mean, there are other property owners that have had that, and my client is kind of the last independent active rooftop owner, and he's having a lot of problems with the Cubs now, and there's been a history of contention with the Cubs over the years with people in that neighborhood. And just to run into a little bit of history in that and explain who Mr. Donegan is, he owns the building at 1050 West Waveland Avenue, which is right by the fire station there, and he happens to have a rooftop that has a fairly decent view of the field at the time. But historically, the Cubs have sought to take that view away from people. My client got a rooftop shortly after he bought the building. He bought the building in 1999.

He's resided in that building ever since. He's been a longtime resident of Wrigleyville and used to own a construction company and did a lot of work in Wrigleyville. And he invested in this building, fixed it up.

Then when somebody came up with the concept of rooftop businesses, prior to that, there was use of people sitting on the rooftops on lawn chairs and that sort of thing. But anyway, once the businesses start, the Cubs kind of interceded in that. And in the early 2000s, the Cubs filed a lawsuit against the rooftop owners to argue that they didn't have the right to the view of the games.

And from my recollection of the outcome in that case, the federal judge determined that it wasn't certain that the Cubs had that right to that view or that the owners of the rooftops necessarily had the right to the view. And a settlement was recommended by the judge. And the parties entered into a 20-year license agreement where under the rooftop owners paid the Cubs 17% of their gross revenues from rooftop operations.

And the Cubs also had in that agreement that they would get 11% of any billboard revenue. Though at the time, and it's still the case, the billboards are not permitted by existing ordinance. But over the years, the Cubs have shown a continued interest in billboards obviously for themselves, but in the context of a couple of agreements, including a more recent proposed agreement with my client.

But in any event, that lawsuit, which again, involved a sort of dispute as to who can look at those games, if you have an own a building across the street and there's the view there, it's highly questionable whether my clients or any rooftop owner really would have to pay legally. But nonetheless, there was this agreement that lasted until December of 2023. And at that time, my client was the last standing independent rooftop owner that was at least active.

And anyway, so over the years, the Cubs have shown an interest in billboards. Even when a new agreement they proposed to him, they wanted a piece of that billboard revenue. The original agreement provided for 11% of the billboard revenue, the new one proposes 50%.

Also, the gross revenues that were originally set up.

[Speaker 1] (1:12:17 - 1:12:21)
Thank you, Mr. Cerny. I can I pretty strict on the three one sentence.

[Speaker 3] (1:12:22 - 1:12:27)
This is an unfair ordinance to other property owners in the neighborhood. This is all for the Cubs and nothing for anybody else.

[Speaker 1] (1:12:27 - 1:12:27)
Thank you.

[Speaker 3] (1:12:28 - 1:12:28)
Appreciate it.

[Speaker 1] (1:12:28 - 1:12:36)
Or time to consider this further. Thank you. I want to acknowledge for purposes of reform.

We have Alderman Hopkins and Alderman Conway. Yes.

[Speaker 3] (1:12:39 - 1:12:39)
Aiden Donegan.

[Speaker 1] (1:12:41 - 1:12:50)
Great. Thank you. Thank you all.

Up next we have Stephen Vance, followed by Aaron Kedrowski.

[Speaker 7] (1:13:00 - 1:15:37)
Hello, members of the Council Committee on zoning landmarks and building standards. My name is Stephen Vance. I'm a resident of the city of Chicago and an urban planner.

I regularly consult on projects that require zoning approvals from this committee as well as the Zoning Board of Appeals and the zoning administrator. I'm here to urge the Council to amend the zoning ordinance to ensure that the Zoning Board of Appeals can function when there are not enough members. The city's municipal code requires that the ZBA has five members and two alternates.

Alternates fill in for members when they are unable to attend meetings due to illness or personal matters. Currently, the ZBA has only three members. This status puts the timely approval of dozens of applications for special use variations and other forms of relief at risk.

The shortfall at the ZBA materially jeopardizes new development, especially matters involving new housing. At the ZBA meeting in February, a proposal for shelter housing in Uptown failed to receive three votes required to be approved. The project received two affirmative and two negative votes.

The project could have passed if the board had all five members. The ZBA's current state is bound to affect two more projects. At least two other shelter housing applications that have the support from the Chicago Department of Housing are intending to be heard this year at ZBA, but these proposals may be forced to wait until the ZBA has a full membership or else suffer the same fate as that shelter in Uptown in February.

This could push back construction and operations of the shelter and further exacerbate the housing and homelessness crisis in Chicago. The mayor and city council should take meaningful steps to address housing and homelessness. Rather than wait for the mayor to appoint additional members to the ZBA, the city council could amend the code to allow alternates to sit in when there are fewer than five regular appointed ZBA meetings.

Currently, code allows alternates to sit in for regular members who are missing that day and not permanently. I urge this committee to consider amending the code to allow ZBA to operate during a time like this when there are too few members. Additionally, the mayor's cut the tape initiative which he announced on Friday and the book I am holding is from that announcement.

It includes strategies to change zoning codes to ensure shelters are allowed to be built in more places and in more circumstances. I would urge this committee to support adopting that ordinance when it comes to you needed to affect that strategy. The progression of development and housing for vulnerable Chicagoans depends on your actions.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:15:39 - 1:15:47)
Thank you very much. Up next, Austin Kedrowski and will be followed by Jason Burma.

[Speaker 6] (1:15:54 - 1:19:00)
Hello and thanks for allowing me an opportunity to speak today. My name is Austin Kedrowski. I'm here as a member of Urban Environmentalists Illinois and bear with me as my first time public speaking like this.

So here we go. Chicago is facing an affordability crisis. We live in one of the best cities on earth and yet people are seeing reasons to leave to, in my opinion, less exciting cities like Phoenix and Houston.

People are moving to these cities because they are affordable and they are affordable because those cities have allowed them to build. Building more housing is essential for keeping rents in check as limited supply allows landlords to charge exorbitant rents, pricing out ordinary Chicagoans. In order to ensure Chicago remains affordable for all Chicagoans, it is critical we tackle the affordability crisis.

Per ABC 7, median rent for one bedroom is up 24% year over year and 10% higher than the national median. For a two bedroom, it's up 30% year over year and 13% above the national median. I stand before you today asking you to create the conditions that will allow the market to build more housing.

We can take three important steps in this aim. The first is let's expand and legalize multifamily development. The second is let's eliminate expensive parking mandates and three, let's expand the ADU pilot program to the whole city.

I think all this is very relevant considering Mayor Johnson's cut the tape initiative that was just recently announced, so I just hear in support of that. So firstly, re-legalizing two and three flats in a majority of the city where they're currently banned, we can promote density in appropriate areas. This new affordability is essential to fighting gentrification.

This isn't about banning single family homes, but rather about ensuring that our zoning policies are equitable and responsive to the needs of all residents. Chicago bans two flats, houses in 79% of the city. Let's follow Minneapolis's lead and get that to 0%.

I can say that from experience. I moved from Minneapolis two years ago, but Chicago native. Second, let's eliminate expensive parking mandates.

These drive up construction costs which discourage investments and diverts away from housing construction. They also discourage alternative modes of transportation and perpetuate urban sprawl. More transit use and less car use in turn help Chicago meet its climate change goals.

Under the current TOD ordinance, mandatory parking minimums are reduced if you are within a certain distance of transit. This was a great first step, but let's eliminate the minimums altogether. If we eliminate mandatory minimums, developers and property owners can build the amount of parking they've analyzed is appropriate for their tenants and customers, but it's likely that developers that never see their parking lots fully filled will elect to not spend the money building them, thus freeing up capital for more housing or simply less carbon intensive construction materials.

More about ADUs, but thanks for your time. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:19:00 - 1:19:06)
Thank you very much. We have Jason Burma, who will be followed by Michael May.

[Speaker 5] (1:19:15 - 1:22:19)
Hello, City Council. I also first time public speaking like this, so I come before you today to address the matter of rising in affordability of Chicago. I currently live in the suburbs, but I hope I'll be able to afford moving into the city this summer.

Per Mary Johnson's recent Cut the Tape initiative, I hope we can act quickly to transform one of our existing buildings to housing. At 5308 North Damon Avenue in Lincoln Square, the neighborhood I'm considering moving into, there's a three story building with its ground floor boasting two shuttered storefronts and the upper floors accommodating six homes. The property owner, recognizing the desirability of this location, seeks to convert these vacant storefronts into three additional homes.

However, the journey towards this goal is hindered by the cumbersome process of government bureaucracy. To proceed, the property owner must navigate through multiple hurdles. Firstly, they must submit a special use request to the Zoning Board of Appeals, which is currently grappling with a backlog and doesn't even have all five seats filled.

Following this, they face scrutiny and criticism at a Zoning Advisory Council meeting, often dominated by NIMBY sentiments. Ultimately, the fate of the proposal rests in the hands of the alder, who holds unilateral power to thwart the project based on community feedback. These procedures for expanding housing options seem nonsensical.

Why should we impede the conversion of ground floor spaces into residences when the upper floors already serve as homes? The proposal necessitates no additional construction, merely an interior remodeling to create livable units. At a time when Chicago's rents are skyrocketing, it is imperative that we streamline the conversion of existing properties into much-needed housing.

By increasing the housing supply, we can mitigate these exorbitant rent hikes that disproportionately affect ordinary Chicagoans. Moreover, facilitating ground floor conversions presents an excellent opportunity to providing housing options that cater to independent seniors and individuals with disabilities. I commend Mayor Johnson for the recent initiative, Cut the Tape, which advocates for streamlining development approvals.

This initiative rightly suggests that expanding the conditions under which ground floor residential conversions are permitted. I urge this committee to take concrete steps towards implementing the necessary ordinances to eliminate the requirement for ZBA approval in such cases. It is time to prioritize practical solutions over bureaucratic impediments.

Let us challenge ourselves to cut through the red tape and empower property owners to efficiently. Thank you.

[Speaker 16] (1:22:27 - 1:22:29)
You'll let me know. Yeah, thanks.

[Speaker 9] (1:22:32 - 1:24:50)
Hi, my name is Michael. I'm a medical resident at the University of Chicago, currently living in the West Loop. In the little free time I have, I come here as an advocate for abundant housing to call on the City Council to select a new chairperson of the Committee on Zoning, Landmarks, and Building Standards as permitted in City Council's Rules of Order No.

36. Mayor Johnson campaigned on a platform that would address inequity, housing affordability, and homelessness, and I know those are also some of the priorities of the members of this committee. Without a chairperson, the committee is not moving any text amendments that could address these issues.

There are other steps we could also take to improve affordability besides bring Chicago home, and the delay in confirming a new chairperson is putting legislative progress in peril. I call upon City Council to promptly recommend a new chairperson of this committee who will prioritize the following two issues. This is especially timely given Mayor Johnson's Cut the Tape initiative.

The first issue is legalized three flats and accessory dwelling units citywide. Classic Chicago three flats are some of our city's most iconic and affordable housing options. They are featured in many of our city's marketing materials, yet current zoning rules prohibit them from being built in many areas of the city.

Accessory dwelling units are a lower cost, sustainable housing option that also provide income for existing homeowners. These changes will not only expand housing options and lessened rents, but will also grow the customer base of local businesses and create more age-inclusive and diverse communities. And these options are popular amongst alders too.

In a survey sent out by Urban Environmentalists and Streets Blog last year, the vast majority of alders that responded supported these measures. If alders support these measures and affordability is a issue number two, support development near transit. Adding housing near public transit naturally supports our robust public transportation system.

When we eliminate parking requirements and build more housing near transit, we also help reduce congestion and carbon pollution, all while making housing more affordable. This is how we support the creation of a healthy, walkable, and bike-friendly community, especially on the south and west sides, which have seen too little transit-oriented development. I hope these tax amendments are considered and we move promptly to appoint a new chair.

Thank you.

[Speaker 16] (1:24:52 - 1:24:54)
Thank you. Yes.

[Speaker 14] (1:24:58 - 1:25:24)
So it seemed like a lot of people are speaking out of the same hem note. Are you all with an organization? Correct.

What's the name of the organization? Urban Environmentalists. Urban Environmentalists.

Pardon me? Urban Environmentalists and Strongtowns. Strongtowns.

Strongtowns. We can actually share their contact.

[Speaker 1] (1:25:24 - 1:29:16)
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Stay tuned. We'll share their contact information with the committee members. Certainly.

Now we will move on to the agenda. First item is document number 02024-0008401, the amendment of the municipal code chapter 17-12 by adding new section 17-12-1105, establishing the boundaries, excuse me, establishing boundaries and regulations for signs within the newly created Wrigley Field adjacent special sign district. Members will find a copy of the ordinance in their packets before you.

We have with us from the Cubs that are able to answer questions, Mike Lofrano, Heather Way-Kitsis and Mara Georges. If you guys want to take one, whoever's going to be in the hot seat, literally to take the hot seat. And we have on the screen a rendering of the two signs being considered today.

I'll go ahead. This is my ordinance. I'll go ahead and give you just a quick update.

I know many of you have heard me say, you know, 20 years ago, the rooftop district really came into being legally. And in looking at some of the ordinances that have been in place in that time, we talked about making some tweaks that better fit sort of the realities of the neighborhood and baseball and, you know, options for today. And so I know we moved an ordinance through license committee a few weeks ago into council.

And we're here today with an ordinance that creates a special sign district around Wrigley Field that is completely coterminous with the Wrigley Field adjacent area, which is that rooftop district that allows an R4 zoned house to have a business on the roof and the top floor, but not the first floor. And kind of breaks all the rules that we would have everywhere else because they are across the street from Wrigley Field. And so with the request for signage, it was looked at to add signage to the district.

I would say the ordinance you have before you is limited. Certainly, we are we're crawling before we walk with this. But it's something that isn't new.

And I think there's been vintage signs around the ballpark for a long, long time. I was looking at old reels from the 80s. And there was some kind of inflatable can on one of those buildings I saw.

So there's a lot of creativity here. And I think, you know, what we've seen here is, is in line of what's what's happening with the rest of the city. Just to be clear, we're talking about allowing two signs that have no noise, no flashing, no video.

They're only illuminated during games and events at the ballpark. And they are facing into the ballpark. There's not really a face that goes to the public.

These are cameras that are signs that face the cameras more so than you and I even sitting in the seats. That's where the revenue for these come. And so there's really we talked about this with our community.

There's really not a ton. There weren't many questions. Actually, I was sort of surprised by the indifference that came up.

But I think people understand, you know, we have a modern Wrigley Field and a vintage space and neighborhood. And, you know, this, this makes sense. So I know, again, some of my colleagues may have questions, I want to make sure you know, we know we're working together with our friends at Clark and Addison.

If you haven't been there recently, I will give you a personal tour. It's a great community amenity when they're not playing. And certainly when they are, you know, we're very proud of the work they've done the investment of the family.

And all those all the great things happen there. So I'm not done yet. I got some more tweaks.

So Mr. Cerny's point from earlier, I know we're looking at things that will benefit and enhance the district as a whole. So with that, I Mara, I don't know if you wanted to add anything as well. Or we can turn it over to questions.

[Speaker 12] (1:29:17 - 1:29:33)
Questions are fine. Mara Georges, for the record, I just would like to say on behalf of the Cubs organization, Chair Lawson, thank you for all of your help throughout this process. It was a highly negotiated process, as you know, it took it took a huge push to get there.

And we really appreciate all your efforts.

[Speaker 1] (1:29:34 - 1:29:38)
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Georges. Questions by committee members, Alderman Hopkins.

[Speaker 11] (1:29:41 - 1:30:27)
Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I support the ordinance. In fact, I submitted a request to be listed as a co-sponsor.

I'm not sure if that went through. And I'll make the do best motion now so we can get that out of the way. Continue with questions.

I just have one question where it's clear that this is intended to be a static sign. Yes. When we all know the common definition of that, but it also explicitly allows LEDs as part of the backlit process.

LEDs can be non-static. I mean, they all are. So that's kind of a conflict.

Do we need further language explicitly making it clear that the LEDs can only be used to illuminate the sign and can't do what LEDs normally do, which is to create, you know, the movement and all the other things that people pay, you know, for for LEDs to have those bells and whistles? How do we address that in the language?

[Speaker 12] (1:30:27 - 1:30:42)
I don't think you need any additional language, Alderman Hopkins, because if you look under the section that says prohibited signs, it does prohibit flashing and dynamic image display signs. So the prohibitions take care of the issue that you are addressing.

[Speaker 11] (1:30:43 - 1:30:51)
So even though we assume the LEDs will have that capability. Correct. It's up to the operator to make sure that it's disabled or just.

[Speaker 12] (1:30:51 - 1:30:59)
Yes, the the LEDs, the talk of the LED is LED backlighting during the games and events.

[Speaker 11] (1:30:59 - 1:31:01)
OK. All right. Thank you.

No further questions, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 1] (1:31:01 - 1:31:20)
Thank you, Alderman Hopkins. Also joining us is Alderman Cruz for purposes of quorum. Any other questions by other committee members?

Hearing none, Alderman Hopkins moves do pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the ordinance is passed.

Hearing none, the item is passed. All right, moving on. We have one map amendment, file number 222, I'm sorry, file number 22325 in the 9th Ward.

Ordinance introduced January 24th, 2024 for the address commonly known as 10636 South Woodlawn Avenue. The change request is business residential institutional plan development number 1167 as amended to business residential institutional plan development number 1167 as amended. This item was heard and passed by the Chicago Plan Commission.

Alderman Conway makes a motion to incorporate all records and findings from that hearing by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections? Hearing none, the records are incorporated.

We have Mariah Degrino from DLA Piper to present.

[Speaker 10] (1:34:31 - 1:36:30)
Thank you. Good afternoon. My name is Mariah Degrino with DLA Piper representing the applicant in the matter Ryan Companies US.

To my right is Mark Kosky from Ryan Companies. As you noted, the matter was considered at a public hearing before the Plan Commission on Thursday, March 21st. The Plan Commission recommended approval.

The site is the remaining undeveloped portion of what's known as Sub Area A within the Pullman Park Plan Development. Sub Area A was originally designated for the retail shopping center. Most of the sub area was in fact developed with the retail shopping center, but the remaining portion has remained vacant for quite some time.

The overall sites you see in yellow is the Pullman Park PD, which is the former Ryerson Steel site on the west side of the Bishop Ford north of 111th. This was designated as a planned development in I think 2010 and has since been developed in phases with a variety of commercial and industrial uses. The application would amend the PD to break apart the area shown in red, which is the development site as a new sub area and to permit that area to be developed with a light industrial facility of 160,025 square feet.

The remaining the portion of Sub Area A that you see kind of to the south of the red area would remain unchanged and as you can see has been developed with a retail shopping center. The proposed development is consistent with the trend of urban industrial development in the neighborhood. New urban industrial uses would support the vitality of the existing industrial uses in the surrounding area, strengthening the city's supply chain network and supporting the industrial job base as well as supporting the overall vitality of the commercial amenities in and around Pullman Park.

The Alderman has provided a letter of support which was incorporated into the record for the plan commission hearing. We respectfully request your approval of this planned development and are here for any questions.

[Speaker 1] (1:36:32 - 1:37:15)
Great, thank you Ms. Degrino. Do I have any questions by committee members? We're quiet today.

I will say I have toured this site with Alderman Beale who I know is very proud of the work that he has done both here and with the National Historic Pullman District and it's been a real catalyst for growth there on the far south side. So hearing no questions from committee members, Alderwoman Dowell makes the motion to pass by the same roll call that was used to determine quorum. Any objections?

Hearing none, the item is passed. There being no further business, Alderwoman Clay moves that we adjourn. Any objections?

Hearing none, we are adjourned. Thank you.

[Speaker 10] (1:37:16 - 1:37:16)
Thank you all. Thanks.
