[Speaker 20] (7:21 - 7:24)
Yeah, come up. You'll come up right here when you're called.

[Speaker 51] (8:19 - 8:21)
I'll go to that seat in the front lobby.

[Speaker 1] (22:53 - 25:57)
We have two items with a multitude of for's and against. We have two items with a multitude of for's and against. What I'm going to do is take public comment period on everything else.

All those other items, we will move the ninth ward agenda item to the deferred just so we can hear. We'll have two testimonies so we'll get through what I consider the regular agenda with objectors and people before. The two items in the ninth and also in the 35th, we will have a separate public comment period and move those on the deferred agenda.

We're going to take a while. For those of you who want to take a break that are not interested in the regular agenda, so be it. If you want to stay, so be it also.

On the table is a motion from Alderman Lopez to defer the item in the 35th ward. That is document number 02019-2659. All those in favor of deferring?

[Speaker 7] (25:59 - 26:00)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (26:00 - 27:21)
All those opposed? No. The motion fails.

Let's start on the public comment period. We have three in favor of an item in the 25th ward. That is application 20216, 25th ward affordable housing.

We will start with Pastor Emma Lozano. Followed by Sarah Walker and Dan Meslow. I hope I got that right.

Nicole from our staff is in control of the timer. What do we give them? Pastor?

Our other witnesses, please come up so we can move fairly. Good morning.

[Speaker 16] (27:24 - 30:03)
As you said, my name is Pastor Emma Lozano. I am the pastor of Lincoln United Methodist Church in the Pilsen community in the 25th ward. I just wanted to begin my statement in support of the ordinance referred number 20216 in the 25th ward.

The address is 1848 58 South Racine. In favor of the zoning change. The Lozano family arrived to the Pilsen area in 1957.

It has been since, I can remember, Mexican immigrant community. Most of our families are low income immigrant mixed status families, which means that in a family you may have an undocumented parent, a dreamer in your family, and some U.S. citizen children or a spouse. So I'm also a member of the organization Pilsen Quality of Life, which is a plan over the years that has developed a plan to provide a quality of life that would meet the needs of its residents in these areas of health care, education, jobs and housing.

And also I'm here to say that we need more low income housing in our community in order to meet the needs of the families who live there. We've had many committee meetings. We've had hundreds of people participating in meetings, and we've all agreed that this type of housing is necessary if we want to be able to continue to live in the Pilsen area.

Again, I'd like to let everyone remember and not forget that this is a Latino community, majority Mexican in particular, mixed status families. Many of our families are undocumented, and this type of housing would not discriminate them. And we need the three bedrooms because we have kids, lots of them, and we have schools in the area that are doing very well where these kids can go and grow.

And we're working very hard on this, and I just urge our aldermen, Cicho, to please continue to bring this type of housing to our community so we can keep our families together. Much√≠simas gracias.

[Speaker 1] (30:03 - 30:16)
Thank you very much, Pastor. Sarah Walker, good morning, Sarah.

[Speaker 37] (30:16 - 31:55)
Good morning. Thank you for hearing me today. My name is Sarah Walker.

I'm a member of Familia Latina Unida Sin Fronteras, an organization in the 25th Ward. I'm also a resident of the 25th Ward, and I'm here to speak in favor of this affordable housing project. The pastor already made a lot of great points about why we need affordable housing in the area, and I just want to reiterate that the community has signed hundreds of petitions that we have here and that have been submitted to you already.

The way I see it as a resident and as a community organizer is that we have three options for this particular place, this particular location within our community. It can either be this project for affordable housing, which will be state-of-the-art, brand-new, affordable housing for hundreds of people, or it can remain a vacant lot, or it can be luxury condos. And the best option for the people who live in that ward, in our ward, in our community, is the affordable housing project.

So I'm here to say that we need this, that there should be no further delay in this project. The community has said that they want it. TRP has listened to the community and has altered their plans based on feedback from the community.

So they've done all their due diligence in order to figure out exactly what the community needs and how to implement it, and there should be no further delay. So I hope that it moves forward today and that the community gets what they deserve, that this wonderful project that we so very much need in our community. Thank you very much.

[Speaker 58] (32:05 - 33:03)
Good morning. My name is Dan Messler. I am also a resident of Pilsen in the 25th Ward.

I am a member of Pastor Lozano's church, but I'm also a DSA member and have been involved in various community organizing, and I feel very strongly in support of this development. We are lacking affordable housing all over the city, but especially in Pilsen. It's a very popular neighborhood.

Forbes Magazine listed it as the 15 coolest cities in the world. Unfortunately, that means that people who live there can't afford to live in such a cool neighborhood anymore. I think that this development goes a long way towards improving the situation for affordable housing.

I feel that the Resurrection Project has been more than fair in listening to resident concerns, and unfortunately at some point not everyone is going to be happy with this development, but overall it would impact the health of the ward in a major, major positive way. So I urge you to approve this development. Thank you.

Thank you, sir.

[Speaker 1] (33:11 - 33:42)
Okay. All right. For the benefit of our audience, our time clock is not working because it's assisting in finance, so they can't walk and chew gum at the same time.

We have our phone. It's going to do it. I hope we meet with your support on that.

Let me bring up Anthony Lapena, and I believe he's opposed to this item in the 25th Ward, but let him speak for himself, I guess. Anthony?

[Speaker 31] (33:43 - 33:47)
Yes, hello. Anthony Lapena. I'm a resident of Pilsen for 12 years.

[Speaker 1] (33:49 - 33:51)
Could you speak into the mic, please?

[Speaker 31] (33:51 - 34:07)
Excuse me. I'm a resident of Pilsen for 12 years. I'm just here to represent some of the community members that couldn't be here today to testify.

I have 103 signatures that I'd like to submit opposing the plan from residents.

[Speaker 1] (34:07 - 34:11)
That will be submitted. Thank you.

[Speaker 31] (34:12 - 35:42)
Do you need more than one copy? I also have a Chicago Sun-Times article talking about La Casa Pilsen and their last project that they built that was a six-story building in Pilsen that was originally for student dorms, and right now it is not for student dorms anymore. Right now it's being used as their offices.

And there was an $8.4 million funds from the state of Illinois that went to that project, and I think there needs to be some accountability for that money before we move forward. The signature against basically opposes the density of units, 37 versus 15. We feel that there are too many units.

We feel that there's a need for affordable housing. But from my perspective, I feel that the focus should be on affordable home care, and they should be using the $20 million to help residents stay in the community. So that's pretty much it.

[Speaker 1] (35:42 - 35:48)
Thank you, and we do have the petitions on record now. Great, thanks. Thank you.

[Speaker 16] (36:02 - 36:03)
Brad?

[Speaker 1] (36:05 - 36:12)
Brad Applund. Brad, is this an item that's on the deferred agenda?

[Speaker 23] (36:12 - 36:13)
It's on the agenda.

[Speaker 1] (36:17 - 36:21)
All right, come on up. No.

[Speaker 42] (36:22 - 36:23)
Yeah, yeah.

[Speaker 1] (36:24 - 36:28)
Great. Good morning, sir. Good morning.

[Speaker 31] (36:28 - 36:43)
Thank you for having me. Brad Applund, I'm a resident homeowner of the Claremont Cottage District. I'm also vice chair of the Tritaylor Community Association, and all of me's are in favor of the landmark designation.

Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (36:43 - 37:38)
Thank you. Short and sweet. All right.

Okay, now we have a few opposition. Yes, I think we have three. Is that correct?

Correct. Okay, three on application 20206, which is on the 2300 block of Cleveland. And I'm going to call all three, if you would come up, and let's hear your testimony.

We'll start with Marshall Eisenberg. Marshall, followed by Trevor Horan, I believe, and Elizabeth Ballantyne, and then Melissa Maso, I hope. Hope I got it close.

Good morning. This is for 23. On page five.

Page five, 2347 North Cleveland. Good morning, sir. Good morning.

[Speaker 47] (37:39 - 39:09)
I'm Marshall Eisenberg. I live in the 43rd Ward. I live at 2343 North Cleveland, the property immediately adjacent to the subject property.

Yes. My house, I've lived in since 1978. I've invested a great deal of money in it.

It survived the Chicago fire, as did the house immediately adjacent to mine in the south. We have asked for several accommodations in this development. We do not oppose development, per se, and have always viewed this empty space as a hole in the block that needed to be filled with a proper development.

This property, as planned, is too tall. It's taller than the building immediately to the north. The setback is not adequate, and there isn't sufficient side space between all of the properties on the north for our neighbors and the project as currently defined.

I believe that there should have been further accommodations by this developer. I don't think any of the issues we have identified would have made a difference in the profitability of this project and would have been highly beneficial to all of the neighbors surrounding this project.

[Speaker 1] (39:10 - 39:19)
Thank you, Marshall. Next, Trevor and Elizabeth. Good morning.

Thank you for having us.

[Speaker 28] (39:19 - 39:22)
Liz and I, like Marshall, are direct neighbors.

[Speaker 1] (39:22 - 39:26)
Could you just say your name, both names, for the record?

[Speaker 28] (39:27 - 41:41)
For the record, I'm Trevor Horn, and this is Elizabeth Valentine. We, like Marshall, are direct neighbors to the property, though on the north rather than the south, and we join with Marshall and the Mid-North Neighborhood Association in opposing the proposed rezoning of 2347 North Cleveland. As Marshall said, I think there's clear rationale for the current zoning of RS3, as the lot in question is the smallest on the block, as you can see in our letter, Exhibit 1.

As Marshall noted, the proposed structure is going to be significantly taller than everything else on the block, including the multi-unit condo building next door. It has half the setback as the next eight single-family homes down the block, and it has significantly less open space, both in terms of square footage and in terms of the percentage of the lot than all the other homes on the block. Finally, it also prevents the access of a truck to the utility pole serving 30-plus homes in the area, an issue, I'm sure, for Con Ed.

And, you know, furthermore, the present developer is uninterested in working with the neighborhood and neighbors to design the property and structure in a way so as to minimize the negative impact on surrounding property values. This is despite asking for significant zoning relief. There have been multiple attempts from neighbors such as ourselves to engage in cooperative discussions on the lot layout, but the developer has made it clear that he's unwilling to consider any compromises.

This failure to consider compromises from neighbors is not surprising, given the fact that this is the owner of the property who has not maintained their property as required by Chicago ordinance. The front acreage has been allowed to grow weeds and such without any landscaping whatsoever, and snow and ice have yet to be cleared during the winter months. So, like Marshall, we are not opposed to construction on this lot.

However, we are opposed to an outside developer developing a property so not at odds with the rest of the homes in the neighborhood. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (41:42 - 41:42)
Any further?

[Speaker 53] (41:43 - 41:43)
No.

[Speaker 28] (41:44 - 41:44)
Great.

[Speaker 1] (41:44 - 41:44)
Okay. Second.

[Speaker 53] (41:46 - 41:46)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (41:46 - 42:05)
By the letters of opposition from the Mid-North Association, and we'll make a copy of it before we go back. Okay. So, as was said in the testimony, Mr. Horan, we do have a letter from the Mid-North Association articulating their opposition to this, and we will get it to our committee members before this item comes up.

[Speaker 32] (42:06 - 44:03)
And Melissa. Good morning. Yes.

Hi. Good morning. Melissa Masek, and I apologize, my handwriting is a little atrocious.

So, I am president of Mid-North Association, so I'm the one submitting the letters. I do have a couple extra copies that I could pass away as well. As the other two people who have spoken, thank you, have reiterated, we're not opposed to development on this property.

We are just opposed to the current plan for this house. We had a community meeting that was very well attended, and it was very clear from that meeting that the community is still at odds with this development as it stands for a lot of the same reasons everyone mentioned before. The height, and I'll just quickly mention a few things we put in the letter.

Again, we have objections that taking it from RS3 to RT4, also given the fact that the historic nature of other homes on this block have the reduced heights. We don't feel that this is in character. They have come back last minute in the last couple of days and decreased the height by about 16 inches.

This does not change our opinion at all. We still believe it is too high. We also believe the setback is not correct.

We also believe that they're asking for greater flexibility as to the minimum side setbacks, and that is too close to the building on the north. And then finally, just in light of the recent reclassification, it was just taken from an RM5 down to an RS3, and now here we are back going to, you know, asking for upzoning, and we think that that's inappropriate. So again, we don't oppose development on that, but we do believe that there's more work that needs to be done on this particular application to make sure that it fits in with this historic neighborhood and historic street.

Thank you so much, Melissa.

[Speaker 1] (44:03 - 45:25)
And again, we do have the copy. We'll get all the copies to our committee members. Okay.

Right. So the two items I mentioned in 35th and the 9th Ward, they will be held. We will have public testimony for them when we get to the deferred agenda.

Okay. Do we have any other witnesses on other matters other than the 9th and 35th Ward that have not submitted their slip to the sergeant? Okay.

So that concludes the public commentary portion of the meeting that I just articulated. We will have a second half. Now we're going to move on to the addendum to the agenda.

We have one appointment today whose resume is in your packet. That is MA 1921, mayoral appointment of Lynn J. Osmond as a member of the commission on Chicago landmarks for term effective immediately and expiring on March 11th, 2023, to succeed my friend, James Houlihan, my resident also whose term has expired.

Good morning.

[Speaker 36] (45:26 - 45:32)
Good morning. Alderman Tooney and members of the committee. I'm honey.

I know that I'm nervous.

[Speaker 35] (45:34 - 45:35)
Okay.

[Speaker 36] (45:35 - 47:03)
I'm Lynn Osmond, president CEO of the Chicago architecture center, the lead organization in the city that celebrates and promotes our architectural heritage through our many educational initiatives and programs. We inspire people discover why design matters. I'm passionate about Chicago and our built environment in my position.

I've had the opportunity to get to know the city and our architectural legacy. It is what makes Chicago unique through my 23 years working in the field of architecture and design. I've developed the expertise that I believe will make me a valuable member of the commission of Chicago landmarks.

I'm well-versed in the historical fabric of our downtown core because of the many neighborhood tours that we do in our signature program, open house Chicago. I'm familiar with the vibrant fabric of our many diverse communities and the importance of keeping their distinctive character. This past year, open house Chicago opened up 300 and building 350 buildings and 38 neighborhoods in all areas of the city for 109,000 people.

I understand the passion of the residents of the places and spaces. They call home. My husband and I are proud residents of the 37th ward and watched our neighborhood in the West loop undergo tremendous change and we're active community participants in the development of the Fulton market landmark district.

As a proud Chicagoan, I'd be honored to serve as the commissioner of the Chicago landmarks and I'm happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (47:04 - 47:11)
Thank you for your interest and service. I just have one quick question. You are resident in the West Fulton market?

[Speaker 36] (47:11 - 47:12)
Yes.

I'm very nervous this morning.

[Speaker 55] (47:22 - 47:23)
Yes.

[Speaker 36] (47:24 - 47:26)
All right. The internet would crack me right now.

[Speaker 1] (47:27 - 47:31)
I know he's here and I'm like, okay, my geography.

[Speaker 55] (47:31 - 47:32)
I'm not doing well. Sorry about that.

[Speaker 1] (47:32 - 47:34)
The great West side. I'll just leave it at that.

[Speaker 55] (47:34 - 47:35)
Yes, the great West side.

[Speaker 1] (47:35 - 47:54)
All right. So we have any questions from committee members on this appointment? Hearing none.

Can I get a motion to pass on this appointment? Alderman Rodriguez moves do pass on the appointment. All those in favor.

Aye.

[Speaker 48] (47:54 - 47:54)

Any opposed? Opinion chair, the ayes have it. And it will be reported out at Wednesday city council meeting.

And thank you very much. Look forward to working with you and you have big shoes to fill. I just want to say that.

Here it is, document number 02019-8454 in the 28th ward for the historical landmark designation for Claremont Cottage District generally located at the 1,000 block of South Claremont. We have Dan Kleiber for the Department of Planning and Development here to answer any questions. We heard some testimony in the witness end of it.

How many? I have one, let's just say. Dan, come on up.

Just briefly, Dan, would you describe this for the benefit of our committee members?

[Speaker 50] (55:20 - 56:13)
Absolutely. Good morning. Dan Kleiber with the Department of Planning and Development.

The proposed Claremont Cottage District is located in the near west side community area on the 1,000 block of South Claremont Avenue between West Taylor Street and West Grenshaw Street. The proposed district contains 19 one-and-a-half-story cottages built in the 1880s in the Queen Anne style of architecture. The Commission on Chicago Landmarks approved the designation at its October 3, 2019 meeting, and the commission found that the proposed district met three designation criteria, one for heritage, one for architecture, and thirdly for theme.

Nine of the 19 owners of the cottages have submitted consent forms in favor of the proposed designation, and the idea itself for the designation was a community-driven initiative. The district is located in the 28th Ward, and Alderman Irvin supports the designation.

[Speaker 1] (56:13 - 57:31)
I love when you say he's in the 28th Ward. Just knowing our alderman from the 28th Ward, we appreciate his support. Questions from committee members on that one?

All right. Can I have a motion to pass on the landmark ordinance? Alderman Cardona moves to pass on the ordinance.

All those in favor say aye. Any opposed? Opinion of the Chair, the ayes have, the ordinance is passed, and will be reported out tomorrow.

Dan, stay here for a second unless there's another staff person. Oh, we do. All right.

So now we're on document number 02019-8543 in the 5th Ward for the historical landmark designation for the promontory apartments located at 5530 through 5532 South Shore Drive. And we have Candalyn Hahn here from the Department of Planning and Development to answer questions should there be any. Questions?

I do. So come on up. Briefly describe the size of this building and a little bit of the history.

[Speaker 30] (57:31 - 58:09)
So the building was completed in 1949, and it was designed by Mies van der Rohe. It was one of the earliest international-style skyscrapers built in the United States and Mies van der Rohe's first skyscraper that was actually constructed. You may be familiar with the design.

It set the standard for decades of architecture to come, and the commission found that the building met four criteria for landmark designation, and the Board of Promontory Apartments initially was the group that requested the designation. Alderman King is, of course, aware of that designation.

[Speaker 1] (58:10 - 58:11)
How many units in there?

[Speaker 30] (58:12 - 58:14)
I don't actually have a final count on that.

[Speaker 1] (58:14 - 58:15)
Hundreds? A couple hundred?

[Speaker 30] (58:15 - 58:16)
Yeah, exactly.

[Speaker 1] (58:16 - 59:48)
Okay. Questions from committee members? I just want to say I live in a Mies van der Rohe building, so I am supportive, but we haven't landmarked our building yet.

But that being said. That's great. Let's move on.

And no questions more? Then I have a motion to move on this ordinance. Do I have a motion to move on the ordinance?

Alderman Siccio-Lopez. Alderman Siccio-Lopez? Moves do pass on the ordinance.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

Opinion Chair, the ayes have it. Ordinance will be passed and reported out tomorrow. Now, we're on to the regular agenda.

Thank you very much, Department. Thank you for your good work. Okay.

So, let's go to the top of page three. Document number 20201T1. In the 47th Ward, ordinance referred on October 16th of 19.

Common address 4304 through 4308. So, it's 4304 through 08 Northwestern Avenue. Change request a B3-1.5 Community Shopping District to a B2-3 Neighborhood Mixed Use Development. Counselor? Good morning, Fred.

[Speaker 54] (59:48 - 1:00:42)
Morning, Chairman. Members of the committee, for the record, Fred Augustin. I'm the attorney on this matter.

I'm here today on behalf of Gerald Coyle. Here with me on the right is Alan Coyle. The applicant's contract purchaser of the subject property located at 4304 to 08 Northwestern.

It's currently approved with a one-story commercial building. We are seeking to rezone the property from the current B3-1.5 Community Shopping District to a B2-3 Neighborhood Shopping District. The applicant plans to demolish the building and redevelop the property with a new three-story residential building containing nine units and nine on-site parking spaces.

Mr. Chairman, this is a type one. We did submit drawings. There have been minor tweaks to the drawings, so we would like to incorporate the updated drawings with our current application, and I believe the Department of Zoning has those copies or a substitute.

[Speaker 1] (1:00:44 - 1:01:11)
Steve? So they made minor changes is what you're saying? Right.

Okay. Great. Okay.

Okay. So Alderman Siccio-Lopez moves to accept the substantive narrative and plans for this type one application. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? Hearing none, the substitute narrative and plans are accepted.

In front of us.

[Speaker 54] (1:01:12 - 1:01:28)
Okay. And just for the record, we have worked with Alderman Martin and his office on this matter. We have presented before their 47th Ward Zoning Advisory Committee as well as the North Center Neighborhood Association.

So he's in support. I believe you should have a letter of support on file.

[Speaker 1] (1:01:29 - 1:01:57)
If not, I do have a copy. No, no. We do have a letter from Alderman Martin.

Questions from committee members? Hearing none, can I get a motion to pass with the substitute narrative and plans? Alderman Siccio-Lopez moves on the substantive narrative and plans.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

Opinion Chair, the ayes have it. And this will be passed with the substitute narrative and plans. Thank you very much.

[Speaker 55] (1:01:58 - 1:01:58)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:01:58 - 1:02:26)
All right. Staying in the 47th Ward on page 3, document number 20205. In the 47th Ward, ordinance referred on October 16th of 19.

Common address, 3357 through 61 North Lincoln Avenue. Change request, B32 Community Shopping District to a C12 Neighborhood Commercial District. Good morning.

[Speaker 13] (1:02:26 - 1:04:06)
Good morning, Alderman Tony and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Ed Kuss, attorney for the applicant. I'm with the Taft Law Firm at 111 East Wacker.

We're here today on a rezoning for 3357-61 North Lincoln. And joining me this morning is Mr. Michael Jornt, who is the owner of the proposed tenant for the property. We are seeking a change from B3-2 to C1-2 to allow a business known as Bitter Pops, which is a retail specialty beer store located currently on Lincoln Avenue, to expand its premises and move down the block to the southeast corner of Roscoe and Lincoln.

They will occupy the entire first floor of that building. There will be no new development on site except for the interior build-out of the first floor. And the reason for the zoning change is to allow Bitter Pops to obtain the necessary permits and licenses to operate its business and relocate there from down the block.

A community meeting was held last Thursday, October 14th, before the 47th Ward Advisory Committee, and the proposed use was well received at that committee. I believe Alderman Martin has indicated his support for this rezoning. So we also agreed with Alderman Martin that after Bitter Pops has been able to obtain its licenses and all permits necessary to open, that the applicant would come back and down-zone the property, if you will, to its current zoning classification today.

The owner of the property has agreed to do this, and we have sent a letter to the alderman confirming that. With that, Mr. Chairman, I would be happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:07 - 1:04:19)
Questions? Committee members? Obviously this is near my ward.

The original location, for the record, is where you're moving.

[Speaker 45] (1:04:20 - 1:04:22)
3345, so we're moving two doors.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:26 - 1:04:32)
My name is Mike Joint. So, Mike, at that location, you have the C-12 there?

[Speaker 45] (1:04:33 - 1:04:33)
Yes.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:34 - 1:04:39)
And the advisory committee and the alderman are comfortable with leaving it at the C-12?

[Speaker 13] (1:04:39 - 1:04:41)
At this juncture, yes. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:04:42 - 1:05:31)
We'll leave it up to the 47th Ward residents there, but appreciate the concept. And I want to know if there are any other questions from committee members. Hearing no questions, do I have a motion to do pass on that?

Alderman Sawyer moves to do pass. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Opinion chair, the ayes have it. Good luck.

Thank you. And I'll be a patron at some point. Especially after this week.

No. The old location. All right.

Next, again, 47th Ward, document number 20213. Ordinance referred on October 16th of 19, common address, 3528 North Ashland Avenue, and the change request, B-12 Neighborhood Shopping District to a C-12 Neighborhood Commercial District. Good morning.

Counselor?

[Speaker 30] (1:05:31 - 1:06:56)
Good morning, Alderman. Corinne O'Hara on behalf of CRED LLC, myself, and Aretta Plasek. I am the attorney as well as one of the members of the LLC who is the owner of 3528 North Ashland.

We are seeking to modify the zoning because Ms. Plasek would like to open up what is considered a micropigmentation salon. And really, the bottom line of it is, it is really a procedure that assists with alopecia, primarily for women and a lot of cancer victims who lose their hair, and it gives the appearance of fuller hair without having to use powders on the hair. So this is a business that would be taking place in just one of the offices that I currently have.

So there is no physical construction. The second floor residential has absolutely no objection to this. There are three parking spots in the back.

Nothing is changing whatsoever. It is just to allow the use of the micropigmentation, which falls under body art. It's all going to be done during regular business hours and by appointment.

And we have the alderman's support. We went to the meeting. We have a detail of what this procedure looks like.

And I have copies of the letter if you need it.

[Speaker 1] (1:06:57 - 1:07:47)
Great. So we do have a letter from Alderman Martin. Questions from committee members?

Interesting necessity, I should say. Yes. So I'm going to ask for a motion from Alderman Cardona.

Moves do pass on this. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Opinion chair, the ayes have it. And good luck and good health.

Thank you so much. Okay. All right.

Now we're in the middle of page four. I'm going to, okay, middle of page four. Where is, I'm going to ask Alderman Burnett.

This is a 44th Ward application. Would you mind chairing?

[Speaker 55] (1:07:48 - 1:07:48)
Sure.

[Speaker 1] (1:07:50 - 1:07:51)
Here, come on and sit up here. Good evening.

[Speaker 3] (1:08:06 - 1:08:08)
And the seat is warm, man.

[Speaker 55] (1:08:12 - 1:08:15)
Okay. Cut it out.

[Speaker 3] (1:08:21 - 1:08:36)
So we're talking about an item in the 44th Ward, 3526 North Halston Street. Change request is from a C13 Neighborhood Commercial District to a C12 Neighborhood Commercial District. Councilor?

[Speaker 21] (1:08:36 - 1:09:07)
Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, my name is Mark Kupiec. I'm an attorney with Offices of 77 West Washington. I represent the applicant, Mike Rafferty, who is present and seated beside me.

And on this particular item, city council was good enough to rezone this property previously for the applicant in order to allow him to enclose a porch. And as part of that application, we promised after the work was done that we would come back and restore the zoning to the prior district. And that's the application before you.

[Speaker 3] (1:09:08 - 1:09:59)
Fantastic. Is there any questions about a body? Seeing none, are there any witnesses?

No. Okay. So all those in favor?

Move to pass. Any seconds? Okay.

All those in favor signify by saying aye. Aye. Okay, good.

Item is passed. Thank you. Thank you.

Got another one in the 44th Ward? Okay. Now we move to item number 20214-T1 in the 44th Ward.

The address, common address is 33...

[Speaker 16] (1:10:10 - 1:10:11)
It's coming up.

[Speaker 3] (1:10:19 - 1:10:42)
So the address is 3346 North Lakewood Avenue. The request is for RT3.5 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to a RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district. Counselor?

[Speaker 6] (1:10:42 - 1:11:35)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name, for the record, is Thomas S. Moore.

And with me today is Mr. Alan Skidelsky, who owns the property. He intends to build a single-family home there, but he will live there with his two daughters and his aging mother, and he wants a little suite for his mother on the third floor, and that's why we need the extra half zoning district from a 3-5 to a 4. We went before the community meetings a couple of times and made changes each time, and we've discussed the matter with Alderman Tunney, and we believe we have his support, and we'd request your support as well.

So, any questions about the body?

[Speaker 3] (1:11:36 - 1:12:10)
Okay, Alderman Tunney? No objections? So, if no questions by the committee members, is there any questions by any witnesses?

Seeing no witnesses, if there's no questions by the committee members, do I hear a motion, do pass? Okay, moved to pass by Alderman Rodriguez. Moved to pass.

All those in favor, signify by saying aye. Opposed, in the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it. The item is passed.

[Speaker 6] (1:12:11 - 1:12:11)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (1:12:22 - 1:13:24)
So, I know there's a gentleman waiting to talk about the 9th Ward. We will get to you. I said in my opening remarks both there's an application in the 9th Ward and the 35th Ward, which we will hold until the end of the regular agenda.

We're going to move both the 9th Ward and the 35th with an additional public comment period. That's all I can say right now. We're going to move on.

All right. Okay, now we're on the top of page 5. Document number 20206 in the 43rd Ward Ordinance referred on October 16th of 19.

Common address 2347 North Cleveland. Change request RS3, residential single unit detached house to an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district. Obviously, we had our witnesses here.

It's fresh in our mind.

[Speaker 16] (1:13:25 - 1:13:32)
Do we have the issue?

[Speaker 1] (1:13:32 - 1:14:19)
So, we have all the opposition in the packets for our colleagues. Let's wait and see. Two seconds for the alderman.

Oh, there she is. Okay. All right.

We're on the Cleveland application, Alderman Smith. So, we're just starting the testimony. There were three witnesses in the public comment period that were opposed to it, and now we are on the item.

So, Counselor, Mr. George? Yes.

[Speaker 18] (1:14:20 - 1:15:29)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is John George. I'm an attorney with offices at 71 South Wacker.

I'm appearing this morning on behalf of the applicant, which is Desco Cleveland LLC, in connection with this application number, which is 20206. Present with me this morning is the owner, Mr. Andrew Smith, and manager of the applicant, and also is the architect, David Berger. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, this property is located at 2347 North Cleveland. It's currently RS3 residential zoning. The applicant filed this application in order to reclassify it to RT4 residential two-flat. The property is currently vacant and used as a parking lot.

What we're seeking to do, and what is depicted on the rendering here on my right, is to construct a three-story single-family dwelling with a three-car garage. The zoning will allow the applicant to construct a single-family home in keeping with the size of the other homes in the neighborhood. This property is in- Say that again.

This home will be constructed in compliance- I see the construction. Pardon?

[Speaker 1] (1:15:29 - 1:15:30)
I see the construction.

[Speaker 18] (1:15:30 - 1:16:03)
In context with the other homes in the area. The property is in Alderman Smith's ward, and I believe she will be here to speak on it herself. We've had at least three or four meetings with Alderman Smith on this.

We've met at least twice with various community groups. We've made a number of changes since the time- This has been going on for about a year and a half now, this project. We've made a number of changes at the request of the alderman and some of the community members.

We stand ready, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, to answer any questions that you might have.

[Speaker 1] (1:16:04 - 1:16:08)
All right. Questions from committee members, or I think we'll hear from Alderman Smith first.

[Speaker 14] (1:16:14 - 1:19:06)
This is a project that's been going on for at least a year and a half. Actually, this is part of the Mid-North Historic District area. It was originally- this entire area zoned R5.

A couple years ago, we had a project approved for this site that was almost double the size of this building based on R5 zoning. Fortunately, that project was abandoned by the developer, and at the request of the community, I down-zoned a single lot in the Mid-North area to R3 in order to make it possible to negotiate with a future- Land use and development. For land use and development.

And knowing full well with the community that at the appropriate time, this would be re-zoned to be a project that was of a similar size to the community. So, in the course of this new developer coming on board, we had a series of ongoing conversations to down-size the building. It is also what you would call a transition building, because next to it is a larger multi-unit corner building.

Then is this lot, and then is Mr. Eisenberg's house, which is set back further on the lot. The lots here are extra long, except for this one, which is still longer than 125 feet, which is allowing the longer front setback. So, after a long series of negotiations with the community, and I'm very, very grateful for the input of our community and how much we worked together on trying to come up with a solution that balanced the community's desire to have a building that would fit in with the community, which I strongly support, and a building that met the zoning of this actual neighborhood, and concluded that an RT4 zoning was appropriate.

We've gone over, the community's had numerous opportunities to weigh in on design, look, setbacks on many occasions, and this building is actually less massive than the otherwise permissible RT4 zoning if it was built as of right. So, based on this, it may not be a perfect building to me or everyone in my community, but I think after a year and a half of effort, we have really responded appropriately on the issues of height and bulk, and that is why I'm asking for the community's support on this single lot.

[Speaker 1] (1:19:08 - 1:19:25)
Questions from committee members on this one? I wanted to ask the alderman, you said it's the Mid-North Historical District. Is this in a landmark district?

Yes, it is. And, obviously, it has the approval of the landmark?

[Speaker 14] (1:19:26 - 1:19:29)
It will be going to the Landmark Commission now. They want zoning first.

[Speaker 1] (1:19:30 - 1:19:39)
And you're comfortable that that would meet the criterion with the landmark? Yes. All right.

Other questions?

[Speaker 57] (1:19:39 - 1:19:45)
Yes. Mr. George, could you outline some of the changes that were made?

[Speaker 18] (1:19:46 - 1:20:42)
Sure. The building had been taller. We reduced the height of the building.

We also, the original design had a setback. The front yard setback was shorter. We've now made it 20 feet in accordance with the zoning.

We've also moved the building around. We've put the driveway to the south of it so that in accommodation to the neighbor next door to us. Mr. Eisenberg's house. Right. And we've done, that's about it. We've taken care of front yard, side yard, height of the building, and the facade.

We've gone through a number of different versions of the facade of the building. And the one that's up on this easel now is what we're going to be building. And we think that when you look at the rest of the block, we think it definitely conforms with the context of the rest of the building in terms of design.

[Speaker 14] (1:20:43 - 1:21:15)
And in addition, when this concept was first considered, we insisted that they move the garage back, so this garage instead of being along the side of the house, which a prior proposal had been, the garage is all the way in the back so that there is a broader distance between the neighboring houses. So really from the beginning of this second proposal, it was dramatically changed to fit more in with the community.

[Speaker 1] (1:21:17 - 1:22:32)
Thank you, Alderman. Other questions? No other questions?

Can I have a motion to move do pass on this item? Alderman Cardona moves do pass. All those in favor?

Any opposed? Hidden in the chair of the ayes have it, and good luck. And, you know, you have a very watchful eye on the block of Cleveland, so, you know, obviously it's a compromise, I see.

But, you know, this is, as you know, Mr. George and the applicant, this is a very important street in our community. Thanks. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, members of the committee. All right. Now we're on the bottom of page 5, 41st Ward, document number 20204, ordinance referred on October 16th of 19, common address 6547 through 49 Northwest Highway, change request RS3 residential single unit detached house district to a B11 neighborhood shopping district. Yes.

Good morning again.

[Speaker 23] (1:22:32 - 1:23:20)
Good morning, Chairman. Nick Fitikas for the record from the Law Offices of Sam Banks. I'm here on behalf of the applicant and property owner, I by LLC.

Again, the subject property is 6547 through 49 Northwest Highway, and what we're trying to do, it's the building, or the property's already improved with a two-story mixed-use building that has two retail units at grade and one residential unit above. The issue is it's currently nonconforming, so we're having problems obtaining licensing for the retail uses. So in order to bring the property into compliance, we're proposing a zoning change to B1-1 neighborhood shopping district.

There are no changes proposed to the building. This is really a use-based change to allow the retail units to continue in operation and use. If you have any questions, we'd be happy to answer them.

[Speaker 1] (1:23:20 - 1:23:57)
Great. Questions from committee members? Hearing none, can I have a motion to move?

Motion by Alderman Cardona to pass on this item. All those in favor? Aye.

Any opposed? Then, Chair, the ayes have it. Thank you, sir.

Good luck. Moving on to page 6, document number 20198-T1. In the 40th Ward, ordinance referred on October 16th of 19, common address 4745 North Artesian Avenue, and the change request, RS3 single, residential single unit detached house district to an RM4.5 residential multi-unit district.

[Speaker 51] (1:23:58 - 1:24:36)
Good morning to you, Mr. Chair. Good morning to the other committee members. My name is Christopher Norback.

I'm attorney for Mr. Hainer. It's his application today. He's the owner of the building.

It's a three-dwelling unit building. And we are seeking a change of the zoning from RS3 to RM4.5. This is in order to comply with the ordinance and allow for Mr. Hainer to do modest improvements to the home. He's seeking to add area to the third unit in the building.

[Speaker 1] (1:24:37 - 1:24:38)
Existing building.

[Speaker 51] (1:24:38 - 1:25:14)
In the existing building. Not to add any dwelling units, not to add or subtract any parking. And Mr. Hainer has already presented this to the community through Alderman Vasquez's office. He was kind enough to host a meeting, at which point there was no concerns and there's no objections to this zoning change. Mr. Hainer also understands this is a T1 application, which he won't be able to make any changes other than the ones already submitted to the zoning department. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:25:14 - 1:25:24)
And we do have a letter of support from Alderman Vasquez. Questions from committee members. What's the amount of addition?

[Speaker 51] (1:25:25 - 1:25:27)
670 square foot and then an outdoor deck.

[Speaker 1] (1:25:28 - 1:26:08)
All right. Any other questions? Hearing none.

Seeing none. Can I have a motion? All the Manhattan moves do pass on the item.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

Chair, the ayes have it. And good luck. Next, again in the 40th Ward, document number 20218T1.

Again in the 40th Ward, ordinance referred on October 16th of this year, 19. Common address 5600 North Ashland Avenue. Change request.

RS3 residential single unit detached house district to a B12 neighborhood shopping district. Good morning, Dean.

[Speaker 25] (1:26:08 - 1:26:55)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of this honorable committee. My name is Dean T. Maragos, the law firm of Maragos and Maragos located at 1 North LaSalle here in Chicago.

I'm here with the applicant, Lynette Nieves, and Mr. Gino Battaglia, who is her associate. We are here to seek a parking exemption to serve an existing daycare center by way of a transit-serve location. We will maintain one apartment and one residential parking space.

We have worked very closely with Alderman Vasquez's aides and office, and we had a community meeting. There are no objectors here. We also have a letter from the alderman in support of this zoning change, if it hasn't been submitted.

[Speaker 1] (1:26:55 - 1:26:56)
We have it already on file.

[Speaker 25] (1:26:56 - 1:26:58)
Good. Thank you. We will entertain any questions.

[Speaker 1] (1:26:59 - 1:27:16)
Questions for this application and Mr. Maragos or the applicant? Hearing none, do I have a motion to move to pass on the item? Alderman Hadden moves to pass on this item.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

Opinion of the chair, the ayes have it. Thank you very much.

[Speaker 25] (1:27:16 - 1:27:18)
Thank you, Mr. Chair and members of the committee. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:27:19 - 1:27:52)
Now we're staying in the 40th Ward, document number 20220T1 in the 40th Ward, ordinance referred on October 16th of 19, common address 6203 through 6209 North Ravenswood Avenue and 1774 West Granville Avenue. Change request, RS3, residential single unit detached house district to an RM6, residential multi-unit district. Interesting change.

Let's hear from the attorney.

[Speaker 6] (1:27:53 - 1:28:43)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name for the record is Thomas S. Moore.

With me today is Mr. Gary Wong and Mr. Marty Cerny. Marty Cerny, who you've heard from before, runs a program called Housing Plus, which seeks to use unused space in buildings to add affordable and accessible units. This particular building is an older building that has 12 existing units, and the up zone would allow us to add four units in the unused basement area.

And Mr. Wong and Mr. Cerny went through a community meeting in the 40th Ward, and we have the support of Alderman Vasquez, and we'd ask for your support as well.

[Speaker 1] (1:28:43 - 1:28:48)
All right, questions from committee members? Alderman Hadden has a question. Surprise.

[Speaker 53] (1:28:49 - 1:29:05)
Oh, no, no. Hello. Hey, Marty.

So I'm very familiar with the Housing Plus program and excited. I'm wondering if you guys could tell us a bit more about the four units that you're adding and kind of how you're making use of the space.

[Speaker 43] (1:29:07 - 1:29:52)
Thank you. Marty Cerny. Marty Cerny, Housing Plus.

It's a rectangular building. It's pretty straightforward. So beneath the four tiers of three units on top, or three units on top, there's an ample basement space, about 900 square feet each, sufficient to fit two bedrooms and two baths, kitchen, dining area, living room, et cetera.

The only modifications to the outside is in the back of the building where we're going to add a new stairway down in to serve as a back entrance or back exit for the middle two tiers.

[Speaker 53] (1:29:53 - 1:30:02)
I know some of the units that... Will these units be accessible units? No.

Because of the stairs.

[Speaker 43] (1:30:02 - 1:30:24)
Logistically, there's just not the space. But like all the other apartments that I brought before this committee, they are livable for people with modest mobility difficulties, which is a population that often gets underserved to. So it's just a few steps down and we're in.

[Speaker 1] (1:30:25 - 1:30:48)
Great. Thank you. Questions?

Other questions? Question for the attorney. Yes.

We worked that out with the alderman. All right. And that would mean that it needs to be rezoned back down.

What is the covenant? What is the covenant in nature?

[Speaker 43] (1:30:49 - 1:31:09)
The covenant is minimum 10 years duration, affordable for populations at 60% AMI. And yes, we're going to rezone back down to it after we're done building the units. Okay.

[Speaker 6] (1:31:10 - 1:31:27)
In cases where it doesn't meet the criteria for the standard affordable, the covenant acts as a lien on title that will require and is enforceable by any interested party.

[Speaker 43] (1:31:28 - 1:31:36)
The other element to the covenant is that there's a self-reporting requirement by Gary to the alderman's office annually.

[Speaker 9] (1:31:36 - 1:31:37)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (1:31:37 - 1:32:23)
Other questions? Hearing none, do I have a motion? Alderman Cardona makes the motion to move do pass on this item.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

Opinions share the ayes have it. And good luck. Thank you very much.

Thanks for bringing affordability. A project that's fairly creative. All right.

On to page seven, document number 20223, 40th Ward. Ordinance referred on October 16th of 19. Common address, 6131 North Hamilton.

Change request, RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district. Mr. Pekarsky, good morning.

[Speaker 17] (1:32:24 - 1:33:14)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My name is John Pekarsky. I'm an attorney with offices at 55 West Monroe Street.

And this morning, I represent Mr. Samsami, who is seated to my right, who is the owner of the property at 6131 North Hamilton. We are simply seeking to legalize an existing garden unit. Put simply, we know, as a matter of fact, that unit has existed since 1978.

And we have talked with our neighbors who have indicated that it has been there for time immemorial. We are simply just seeking to legalize the existing unit.

[Speaker 1] (1:33:16 - 1:33:29)
Questions from committee members? Hearing none. Alderman Cardona moves to pass on the item.

All those in favor? Any opposed? Opinion chair, the ayes have it.

Good luck.

[Speaker 50] (1:33:30 - 1:33:30)
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (1:33:31 - 1:33:54)
Thank you, John. All right. Moving on to the 38th Ward, document number 20208.

Ordinance referred on October 16th of this year. Common address, 5920-22 West Irving Park Road. Change request, B31 community shopping district to a B22 neighborhood mixed-use district.

Counselor, Mark?

[Speaker 21] (1:33:54 - 1:34:46)
Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, my name is Mark Kupiec. I'm an attorney with Offices of 77 West Washington, represent the applicant. And I have with me today on behalf of the applicant, Willem de Koning, seated beside me.

And on this particular item, at Alderman Sposado's request, we attended a community meeting, showed the plan, answered the questions. After that community meeting, we followed up with Alderman Sposado. And I believe that you have his letter of support.

The thrust of the project is there's an old building there. The old building had an old food and liquor store. We're going to demolish that building, build a new building.

The new building will preserve a commercial unit on the ground floor with residential units above it. And the three-story building will be compatible with other buildings down the street on Irving Park Road.

[Speaker 1] (1:34:49 - 1:34:53)
Questions? Quick question. Size of the commercial space?

[Speaker 21] (1:34:53 - 1:34:54)
Pardon?

[Speaker 1] (1:34:54 - 1:35:06)
Size of the commercial space? Approximately 2,000 square feet. 2,000.

Irving Park is a very commercial district. We want to make sure that we have a business maintaining on the ground floor.

[Speaker 21] (1:35:06 - 1:35:17)
Correct. I mean, that was certainly part of our presentation to the Alderman and to the community that we would preserve a commercial unit on the ground floor so we preserve that commercial feel of Irving Park.

[Speaker 34] (1:35:18 - 1:35:19)
Okay. All right.

[Speaker 1] (1:35:19 - 1:35:26)
Other questions? Hearing none, I have a motion. All the Manhattan moves do pass on the item.

All those in favor?

[Speaker 21] (1:35:27 - 1:35:27)
Aye.

[Speaker 1] (1:35:27 - 1:35:32)
Any opposed? Opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it, and this item is passed.

[Speaker 21] (1:35:32 - 1:35:32)
Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:35:33 - 1:35:52)
All right. Also in the 38th Ward, document number 20217, ordinance referred on October 16th of 19, common address 5812 West Montrose Avenue, and the change request, RS3, residential single unit detached house district to a B11 neighborhood shopping district.

[Speaker 60] (1:35:53 - 1:35:54)
Good morning, Mr. Chairman.

[Speaker 25] (1:35:54 - 1:35:55)
Good morning.

[Speaker 60] (1:35:55 - 1:36:48)
John Screw representing Sandro Monacovic, owner of Sandro's Barbershop. Sandro purchased this property several years ago. It was an existing barbershop on the premise.

It had been grandfathered in for numerous years. When he bought it, he attempted to get an awning permit to change the awning out, only to find that because it was in a residential zone, the sign would not be allowed. That was what was driving this zoning change.

We met with the alderman over the past year, talked about it. He had absolutely no issue with it. There was an awning there before, had been there for many, many years.

So this change from the RS3 to the B11 will not only allow for the awning, but it will also allow for the barbershop, so there will be no issues down the road.

[Speaker 1] (1:36:49 - 1:38:24)
Okay. Any questions? Questions from committee members?

Obviously, we've all been dealing with this issue in our wards, so I appreciate Alderman Sposato getting this done. Do I have a motion to move to pass on the item? Alderman Hadden moves to pass on the item.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

Opinion is shared. The ayes have it. And let's get back to work.

Thank you. Okay. Okay.

So now we're going to hold item number 20219 in the 32nd ward. Alderman walks back, and we have to get together with him before we present it. All right.

So now we're in the famous 31st ward with document number 20199T1, ordinance referred on October 16th of this year, common address, 2900 through 2904 North Laramie Avenue, and the change request, RS3, residential single-unit detached house, to a B23 neighborhood mixed-use district. My understanding, we have a substitute. Narrative and plans for this type 1 application.

And I get a motion to accept the substitute. Alderman Hadden moves to accept the substitute narrative and plans of this type 1 application. All those in favor?

Aye. Any opposed? Opinion, the chair, the ayes have it, and we have the substitute narrative and plans are accepted and before us.

[Speaker 49] (1:38:25 - 1:39:39)
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Tyler Manick, attorney for the property owner. With me is Paul Sekiris, beneficiary of the land trust that owns the subject property at 2900 North Laramie.

The existing building built over 50 years ago is a mixed-use building with three commercial spaces at grade and 13 dwelling units. Due to a change in the zoning map to put this property in an RS3 zoning district, this property has fallen out of compliance with the Chicago zoning ordinance. The applicant seeks a zoning map amendment to a B23 neighborhood mixed-use district in order to bring this property back into compliance and allow for the renovation of the interior commercial spaces that convert the three commercial spaces into three business live-work spaces.

At this time, the applicant can't pull permits for these commercial spaces to do the renovations because it is out of compliance in the RS3 district. Prior to filing this application, we did meet with Alderman Cardona. He did give us a letter of support and he's present here as well.

With the support of the Alderman, we respectfully request that this committee's favorable recommendation for the rezoning of this property. And we're happy to answer any questions.

[Speaker 1] (1:39:40 - 1:39:43)
Questions from committee members. Alderman Cardona.

[Speaker 46] (1:39:45 - 1:40:16)
Thank you, Chairman. I approve the zoning change because it affects my neighborhood. I directly live by this project that's going to be built.

When I spoke to the gentleman here, we talked about a different way of looking at things because right now it's an eyesore. And this project of work-live environment would be suited, fit for the neighborhood and for the community. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:40:16 - 1:41:13)
Questions for the Alderman or the applicant? Hearing none. Do I have a motion to move to pass on the item?

Alderman Rodriguez moves to pass. All those in favor of what moves the substantive narrative plans for this type one application. Alderman Rodriguez moves to that effect.

All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

Opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it. And the substantive narrative is passed and moved to the council. Thank you.

Now we're going to move to page nine, top. Document number 2020031st Ward. Ordinance referred on October 16th of this year.

Common address 5200 West Roscoe. The change request. RS3 residential single unit detached house district to an RM4.5 residential multi-unit district. And we have Councilor Maragos.

[Speaker 25] (1:41:13 - 1:42:07)
Good morning again, Mr. Chair and members of the committee. My name is Dean T. Maragos of One North of South Street.

I have the honor and privilege of representing Gino Battaglia, who is the applicant and is present here. We have presented this. The purpose of the rezoning is to have three first floor residential dwelling units and one dwelling unit on the second floor with four off street parking spaces.

There is no commercial space. The building is a two story brick building, 26 feet in height. A two story brick frame coach house will be removed.

We have worked with Alderman Cardona and his staff over a period of time. The community has been apprised of this and we have heard no objection. And the Alderman is here.

We also have a copy of his letter of support for this zoning change. We will entertain any questions. All right.

Alderman Cardona is here. Would you like to speak on it, Alderman?

[Speaker 46] (1:42:08 - 1:42:15)
Chairman, thank you. Yes. When Dean Maragos and Mr. I don't want to chop off your name.

[Speaker 32] (1:42:16 - 1:42:16)
Battaglia.

[Speaker 46] (1:42:16 - 1:42:16)
Battaglia.

[Speaker 32] (1:42:17 - 1:42:17)
It's a famous name.

[Speaker 46] (1:42:18 - 1:43:08)
Came to the office. I knew about the building. There were some issues there.

I did speak to the residents around surrounding the area and told them what was going to, what was the effect of changing. We're going to change the zoning and we're going to bring in three apartments. The residents in the neighborhood were supportive.

And from there, from me talking to them, I reached out back to Mr. Counselor Dean Maragos and I told him, go ahead with the zoning change. I support this and I think it would bring more, more living spaces along Roscoe. And also I agree of tearing down the coach house to provide parking for the renters there.

So it kind of so they don't have to be parking on the residential street and they have their own parking spaces. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (1:43:08 - 1:43:24)
Thank you. Alderman questions for the Alderman or the applicant. Hearing none.

[Speaker 3] (1:45:21 - 1:45:23)
So what are you doing with the afford?

[Speaker 6] (1:45:23 - 1:46:06)
Well, they will meet the affordable requirement. And I believe they're going to meet it on site. This is the old St. Paul federal. And it was later other banks. And this is the whole parking lot next to it. And this is really a part of the redevelopment of the.

Bank building itself, which has been vacant for about six years. The hope is all. It's still not pinned down, but the local.

Gail would library would be on one part of it and daycare and the other with apartments up above. So this is the. The block that was the parking lot next door.

It's part of a whole. And yes, we will meet the. Affordable requirement.

[Speaker 3] (1:46:07 - 1:46:08)
What is that? Six units.

[Speaker 6] (1:46:08 - 1:46:38)
Well, it. Depending on whether you consider the. Bill.

The bank buildings. Zoning is going to stay the same. So there was some talk with mr.

Root in the affordable that It would you would need to conglomerate and meet the requirement not just for this park the building built in this parking lot But also for the building across the street as well. So Whatever the requirement is it's at least six.

[Speaker 3] (1:46:38 - 1:46:43)
Yes, sir Six for this part. It's another 10% for the other.

[Speaker 1] (1:46:43 - 1:47:48)
Yes You know, I think the Alderman saying is on site right everything's I believe that's true. Yes multitude of sight, right? All right other questions If not, I'm on a motion move to pass with the subject substantive narrative and plans Can I get a motion?

Alderman Burnett moves to pass on with the substantive narrative and plans all those in favor, I Any opposed opinion and share the ayes have it. Thank you very much. Thank you and good luck.

They fully support the project So I support the project and Also just wanted to mention in this particular area Because we do have a lot of development going on over there.

Mr. Chairman is for m1 to 2b 2-3 for 20 dwelling units 20 parking and a very large retail space About almost 1,600 square feet with a mezzanine on the sidewalk level The site is near the Kinsey PMD. Mr. Chairman, but it's not in the Kinsey PMD so six years ago, and it was good thinking at the time Chicago Grand Neighbors said let's Develop a buffer between Residential on the north side of Grand and the PMD on the south side of Grand Avenue Again this site is not in the PMD, but although that was good thinking at the time things change and the Kinsey PMD has changed with that subdistrict B and the Kinsey PMD is wildly successful and should be protected, but Now has these relaxed rules about uses so with Alderman Burnett's Leadership really we met with Chicago Grand Neighbors president Peter Frisby met with them several times and Alderman Burnett has carefully studied this site and wants to create it more of a balance along Grand Avenue So that some of these sites that are manufacturing could be developed and their residents are fully in favor of that

[Speaker 1] (1:52:37 - 1:52:43)
Great Thank You Dan We have Alderman Burnett here. Would you like to opine on this one?

[Speaker 1] (1:52:43 - 1:52:44)
Thank You.

[Speaker 3] (1:52:44 - 1:54:34)
Mr. Chairman So we just we did just have a community meeting with the Grand Avenue neighbors They also had a meeting at that meeting was the Industrial Council in Newark, Chicago, of course For their purpose of protecting industry the Industrial Council in Newark, Chicago Went against this but the residents were for it, so I was in the middle of a situation here and So we determined with the new Vision of the PMD number four Initially Grand Avenue used to be the buffer, but we actually sort of moved the buffer over to Hubbard Street with allowing for Retail and and larger office spaces to be built Next to this property.

So the buffer has actually been moved over So we see this property which is right outside the buffer now But also on a block where we have 13 homes we have 13 apartment buildings on this block which was grandfathered it grandfathered Grandfather in as they see three years ago to make it a buffer but not conforming now We're going to allow this to be rezone and it would be conforming with all of the other residential properties on this block also this developer Nice young lady and her family they committed to doing All affordable housing on site Am I correct?

[Speaker 38] (1:54:35 - 1:54:36)
That's right

[Speaker 3] (1:54:36 - 1:55:27)
All affordable housing on site and I just want to for the record Planning I just want to make sure that everything is square with the Department of Housing that that's before it goes to council tomorrow that that that's all stated correctly So I think in this area if I'm not mistaken in our pilot program I think is a 10% of 15% 15% 15% over here So that would be how many units of the number three units three units.

Okay, fantastic So we look forward to this Very proud of this family of what they're doing and we look forward to this development I had to cut the baby in half and I think I'm making the right decision In reference to this and I asked for the committee's support with this also.

So we're gonna start with Reverend Paula She is not present.

Okay, so we will then we will move to Reverend Bruce For the record.

[Speaker 26] (2:18:36 - 2:21:03)
My name is Reverend Bruce Ray I'm pastor of Kimball Avenue United Church of Christ, and I'm also a member of the Logan Square Ecumenical Alliance a group of eight congregations That have been working on affordable housing and other issues in our community for the past six years Our churches have been working to bring Affordable housing more affordable housing options to Logan Square and when the Emmett Street property was proposed as a site for affordable housing We have been working to pass this proposal and and get it approved and We are excited that it is at this point in the process.

I Highly support it. I have lived in the neighborhood Since 1978 at the time that I moved into the community The the Latino demographics of our community were a majority That was the case until three years ago when white non-hispanic residents became the majority People moved into our community because it was diverse people moved into our community because it was affordable people moved into our community because They liked that it was a Place where their children and their families could interact with many different cultures while the over the past 20 years 19 years 20,000 Latino families have moved from the community in addition the population when I moved to this community was 13% African American it is now 6% African American What is happening in our community is as gentrification has happened Diversity is decreased affordability is no longer Present in our community and we need affordable housing now It is not going to happen through the private developments It is only going to happen when not-for-profit development is given the green light to be able to provide housing for people who are being displaced And so our churches are in full support of this effort to bring affordable housing to Emmett Street And I ask you please please approve this project so that we can make sure that families who want to stay in our community

[Speaker 1] (2:21:03 - 2:21:26)
Have the ability to stay. Thank you. Thank you.

And thank you Reverend for articulating that I do want to say that With many other supporters try to make sure we've heard loud and clear your articulation of this issue so as we move through the The pros for this thing. We try not to be redundant. It's very clear.

You spoke very well next Julia

[Speaker 15] (2:21:26 - 2:24:34)
Hi, thank you very much for the opportunity to speak on behalf of this project My name is Julia Garris Menko, and I'm the Chicago advocacy manager for the active transportation Alliance So we're a nonprofit advocacy group working to promote walking biking and public transportation to create sustainable Healthy and more equitable communities I'm here to testify in support of the rezoning of the Emmett Street and Kedzie Avenue lots in order to construct the 100% affordable housing development by the Logan Square blue line We see the Emmett Street proposal as a forward-thinking and vital development that advances our mission We cannot be true advocates for sustainable transportation without considering equitable access to transportation We stand in solidarity with affordable housing advocates as our issues are interlinked and the cornerstone of quality of life in our communities The high cost of housing near sustainable transportation options CTA train stations in particular Are a major barrier to our vision of a Chicago where all residents can easily walk bike and take public Transit regardless of their income or race and ethnicity Community residents have long been organizing in support of this project many of our partners including Logan Square Neighborhood Association Metropolitan Planning Council and Bickerdike Redevelopment Corporation have worked tirelessly over that same time to advance this proposal we're excited several other councils have been approving it and it's great to see that there's Support for moving this urgent project forward at a time when Chicago is facing a tremendous shortage of affordable housing units So this project will add a hundred affordable units near transit and retail It will encourage more people to walk bike and take transit It will help prevent the displacement that the reverend so eloquently described previously Just as important the development will make it easier for low-income people and families to avoid the high cost of car ownership right now according to AAA costs almost $9,000 a year to own and operate a car and that is simply out of reach for many on a fixed income Research shows that equitable transit oriented development like Emmett Street will improve public health minimize traffic congestion create cleaner communities Strengthen the labor force and increase transit ridership the success of equitable transit oriented development Proposals like this one are critical to increasing transportation options for all Chicagoans especially low-income families Transit oriented development in Chicago cannot be an initiative that only benefits the wealthy Who can afford to pay rents for studio and one bedrooms?

We're pleased this project features a hundred percent affordable units and includes a mix of family units The proposal will also ensure the transportation improvements of the proposed changes by the Department of Transportation To the intersections of Milwaukee Avenue and Kedzie and the CTA blue line are shared equally by longtime residents Thank you for your consideration.

[Speaker 1] (2:24:34 - 2:25:17)
Thank you, Julia And thank you for your good work on the active transit and of course to DS Which is still a learning curve in a lot of communities All right. So let me get three in opposition to this project and they are Josh Hutchinson Sarah Maxwell and Jerry Youngberg, I believe can you all three come up and speak in whatever order you'd like But just identify yourself for the record, please Hello, I am Josh Hutchison I'm Logan Square resident thing.

[Speaker 40] (2:25:17 - 2:26:17)
I believe it is. Okay. Okay, maybe I need to get closer So this is a project that has obviously received a lot of publicity And it's been very contentious in many ways the supporters of the project have really rallied around this notion of democracy and Inclusion I would have to say that the reality is a very different picture a community a community meeting which was essentially a Pro-housing rally where people with dissenting opinions were shouted down and intimidated Does not constitute a democratic process Okay, so I'd like to submit as evidence Signed protest slips by over 50% of the adjoining neighbors of the Emmett Street lot There are many reasons people object to are you gonna submit that to us?

[Speaker 1] (2:26:17 - 2:26:18)
Yes right now.

[Speaker 40] (2:26:18 - 2:27:01)
Yes There are many reasons people object to this project and there are too numerous to to cover in this meeting But the rights of these property owners, they have the right to be heard They have the legal right to have their voices heard. I asked the committee to delay approval of this project Until the voices of objecting voice the voices of the objectors are heard by Alderman Rosa and And that means that he listens to his constituents and he considers Changes to the project and modifications to the project so that it has true Community support.

[Speaker 48] (2:27:01 - 2:28:16)
Thank you Thank you Thank you, Josh Next my name is Sarah Maxwell and I live directly across the street from the proposed development on Emmett At the farce of the community meeting run by Alderman Ramirez Rosa. I was shouted down when given my shortened time to speak I've been living in the area for 13 years and I'm a small business owner that also works in the area So I'm not sure why my opinion would matter less The lack of public process that has come with this massive project has been startling Other Alderman near in nearby areas have seemingly been able to run legitimate community meetings where immediate neighbors are allowed to voice their concerns and Provide IDs showing that they are directly impacted by the project No one from Bickerdike contacted me or my immediate neighbors to work with our feedback Protestants protest slips have been submitted that were collected showing over 50% of immediate Adjacent neighbors do not support this project. Those have been turned into the committee and we have received them and they're in the packets This project is too large for a tiny residential street is too dense. It is too tall it does not fit in with the neighborhood visually in any way shape or form and I ask that the committee reject this zoning change until the Applicant can submit something that fits in with this historic area.

[Speaker 39] (2:28:16 - 2:29:29)
Thank you Hi, I Owned 2717 North Sawyer Avenue, which is just right The parking lot is in my backyard of the condo. So that I live in With all my other Individual owners. I do not own the building.

I'm just a private owner First of all the last six years even prior to the alderman being elected into his position He was passing out flyers that this was his agenda a hundred units of affordable housing in this specific lot Now I do understand that there are needs for affordable housing But you know, we're picking the most dense most costly way to do that, which is new construction There's absolutely no competition with Bickerdike because I saw lots of Bickerdike Representatives when we had the Metropolitan Planning Council meeting six years ago They don't even hide their shirts are all Bickerdike and supposedly they all live in my immediate area There was have been no evidence His rally in April as well. I've been talking for the last six years.

[Speaker 1] (2:29:29 - 2:29:33)
All right He's been telling me okay, but we don't point.

[Speaker 39] (2:29:34 - 2:29:34)
Okay.

[Speaker 1] (2:29:34 - 2:29:36)
Okay. So that's I just want to say that.

[Speaker 39] (2:29:36 - 2:29:58)
Okay. Sorry I've been talking to him for several months on and off for the past six years and he is Insisted that that's a lot is zoned for two stories and that it would never be considered more than two stories Unless we were heavily involved in that decision-making. So we've been blindsided for his vote Thank you for coming down.

[Speaker 1] (2:29:58 - 2:30:29)
All right Let me get back to my list here. That was Jerry now. We're going to hear from in the in favor We'll talk to listen to Deborah McCoy and Tanya Cavanaugh and Gladys Rivera German these are all in favor all men Rosa.

I was just released from the hospital on Friday I had to have a pacemaker put in and everything So, I'm just grateful to be here to speak on behalf of affordable housing One thing I've learned about bigger Dyke They have done something for me that no one has ever done and that was to give me stability through affordable housing I just I love it. I love my neighborhood.

I love my neighbors It's just some a place where I can grow as an older woman Into a beautiful grandmother. I support the industry project affordable housing We need this it's a human right, you know Do we live in one of the greatest cities in America? and I believe that with affordable housing we can't make our city great again if we just support it and To all the non-believers.

I'm just praying that you guys have some compassion for someone that's lower than you I don't know if you ever experienced anything like this I'm crying right now because no one you guys don't know what it's like To go without and to live low you understand what I'm saying So today I cry tears of joy because I'm still here It's a blessing to go home from the hospital to go back into my apartment through bigger Dyke You understand it's just to be able to grow so I support the movement of affordable housing.

[Speaker 52] (2:32:32 - 2:33:39)
Thank you so much All right lattice Um, hi everybody, my name is Gladys Rivera I am a community resident after suffering hardship and loss I find myself being priced out of apartments and forced to live in places that were not suitable for raising a family During this time. I knew my family deserved more. We deserve stability and a safe place called home I stand before you today as a resident who lives in affordable housing unit My home is called Zapata Apartments Without affordable housing in Logan Square many families won't get the same opportunity I got to raise kids in the community.

They've known and loved for so many years Everybody deserves quality affordable housing, which is why I voted for the MCP meeting back in 2014 and this is why I stand before you today to support the 100 affordable housing units in Amnesty Project Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (2:33:39 - 2:34:13)
Thank you Now we'll have a we have a couple more in opposition and they are Allison Hubert and Nicholas Katsafados, I believe Did I pronounce that right or what? Okay I'm sorry, Allison is Okay, but she is recorded as in opposition All right, Nicholas All right, my name is Nicholas Katsafados, I'm a Logan Square resident and Concerned citizen.

[Speaker 34] (2:34:14 - 2:36:01)
I am NOT opposed to affordable housing on this site I want to make that clear from the get-go but the process to date has not complied with the law and The applicant has made no attempt to engage with the immediate impacted property owners who have standing here no proper notice was properly followed at the site or To the surrounding homeowners I Asked at the project be tabled so that the applicant can bring hit their proposed design In line with the standards required by the zoning code which it does not currently meet and the reasons are outlined in our submissions of which you'll get some additional today as well and To that proper notice is provided as required by due process in the Constitution the applicants engage The applicants need to be engaged with the surrounding property owners as required by law The majority of owners with standing regarding this oppose it as it's currently presented almost 60% and there are written notarized slips the alderman is a fan of Community participation. So we have 60% of the of the property owners with standing here that have opposed this and notarized slips supported For the record how many what's that number just you said see it's like 59 percent.

Okay, I don't know real not percentage but Approximately, I don't know that number off the top of my head, but it has been submitted. Okay, you know, you guys should have it You know because percentages are percentages, you know, yeah, I there's actually Well, just I'm sure the alderman We Hope to have the opportunity to work with the applicant to come up with something that conforms with the legal requirements and has followed the proper notice protocols That's essentially it. Thank you so much.

[Speaker 1] (2:36:01 - 2:36:12)
So while you're here on on the dais, I'm gonna ask Patrick Murphy our Administrator here. Where's Patrick? Patrick you want to talk about the notice requirements?

So we put it on the record, please

[Speaker 35] (2:36:14 - 2:36:43)
Patrick Murphy with the Department of Planning and Development This project being a plan development has two different hearing criteria one being the introduction to City Council and then deferral from committee on zoning until today and the other being the Plan Commission hearing process the Notice for all the Plan Commission from the posting on the property as well as the mailed notice and the associated affidavits that come with that making property owners Aware of both the hearing time date and purpose have all been fulfilled and they're in the application

Good afternoon for the record. My name is Madeline Schroeder And I am a community resident I found myself homeless in 2017 because of Hurricane Maria I Was lost for eight months of my life living in two different hotel rooms in Chicago Now I have a home a place I feel safe and secure this place is called Zapata Apartments Baker died was there for me and so many other families during this horrific time when Hurricane Maria hit I Stand before you today in the exact same spot that others stood over five years ago to support a project like this one One that people didn't think was needed and that people didn't want to see built in their backyard But I but here I am living proof that affordable housing is desperately needed for working-class people like myself Zapata apartment has been a blessing to me and many other families who without Baker died will be displaced Without organizations like this one, so many families will be in crisis. I Am one of the lucky ones.

I found more than just a landlord. I found a bigger Dyke family. I Will do my part so that others have the same opportunity that I had That's why I'm here today to support affordable housing at the MS Street project a project that will allow families the opportunity To live and work in a neighborhood city.

We're talking about a space for People that are being displaced. We're not talking about views of a monument and we're not talking about surface parking lots and We're not talking about the need for individual consultation as a as a means for delay.

I Heard today a request for a delay until voices of objectors are heard and it occurs to me that it seems worth saying That because you do not get your way does not mean no one heard you it means you are disagreed with and I also want to say that when I hear notions of I heard in the in the plan commission hearing things like well this supposed Community meeting that the alderman held was stacked You know What that means is that yes Bickerdike and Logan Square Neighborhood Association and others brought out their people that's called the power of organized people that is what that is and That process and those people and that process has spoken we're now in the final stages Of moving this project forward and I just want to say one more time for the record that this is Not just this particular project, but what this means what it means that we value people We value access to transit. We value affordability in places that are losing it That is what this Department of Housing is about and it this project has my full support Thank You Commissioner and thank you for your leadership We're gonna we're gonna now move to the presentation and let me read into the record.

[Speaker 1] (2:44:35 - 2:44:58)
Alderman Cardona moves to incorporate the records from the plan commission all those in favor aye any opposed It's our committee there Opinion of the chair our committee is in favor of incorporating the records Thank you One objection yes, okay all right

[Speaker 4] (2:44:58 - 2:44:59)
continue with the

[Speaker 1] (2:45:00 - 2:45:01)
Incorporated plans, thank you

[Speaker 4] (2:45:02 - 2:48:08)
So the total site is approximately 47,000 square feet It's bounded by Emmett Street to the northeast Kedzie Avenue to the east An alley to the southwest and the four-story residential building to the northwest The site is directly adjacent to the CTA's Logan Square blue station a blue line station This is a transit serve location because it's directly adjacent to the blue line It's also located near the CTA's number 56 and 76 bus stops The Department of Transportation has future plans and the drawing that's showing right now is probably a good drawing to leave up there for a moment is Has future plans to reconfigure Kedzie Avenue And it will impact the site. We've designed the project to accommodate a setback that is Required for the relocation of Kedzie and Therefore the 47,000 square foot site comes down to a net developable site of approximately 41,000 square feet The building will be seven stories tall it'll be constructed with precast wall panels Aluminum or vinyl windows and aluminum storefront glass windows the building steps down as you can see in the picture That's showing right now Toward the Sawyer Avenue facing elevation to provide relief to that building and to Fit within the context of the area.

I would note that we felt it We really appreciated many of the comments by plan commissioners About the appropriate context of the building and how it fit within the neighborhood The ground floor of the building contains approximately 4,100 square feet of commercial space facing Kedzie and community space facing Emmett residential lobby laundry room bike room and management office We do have some slides and and I'll just touch on the components of the of the project regarding landscaping We are going to comply with the city's landscape ordinance and there will be new shade trees Aligning both Emmett and the reconfigured Kedzie Avenue parkways Will the project will also contain some green roofs which you can see from the the drawing above The project will also comply with the city's sustainability Rules our sustainability policy and Satisfy the correct number of points under that policy Finally I would note that the project will meet or exceed the 26 MBE 26% MBE and 6% women business enterprise participation and Provide significant local participation with 50% of the staffing being from Chicago residents with that We would certainly take any questions the committee might have all right questions from committee members

[Speaker 1] (2:48:08 - 2:48:12)
I know we're gonna hear from Alderman Carlos Ramirez Rosa, but Alderman Rodriguez

[Speaker 4] (2:48:12 - 2:48:14)
Thank you so much.

[Speaker 57] (2:48:14 - 2:48:59)
This is a Splendid day in our city as far as I'm concerned a real effort to bring major affordable housing to areas of our city that are desperately lacking that kind of diversity and I want to commend Bickerdike and all those involved in this effort You know we've got a lot more a lot of more work to do in the city And I think you're paving the way I do have a couple of questions Because I I do it does matter to me to hear everybody it does matter to hear dissenting voice and understand where people are coming from so I Tell me more about the commercial space in the first floor are there private interests that are that are currently being talked to about occupying that space I

[Speaker 33] (2:49:01 - 2:50:00)
Joy I don't get there the CEO at Bickerdike redevelopment corporation and There is Two small commercial spaces is about 5,000 square foot of commercial space we do not have current dialogue going on, but we're thinking that the type of The commercial space came out of the community planning process, which is why we've incorporated it It's also with the Kedzie reroute We will be right on Kedzie Avenue As well as right near a transit node, and so it makes sense to have some kind of appropriate business so perhaps this coffee shop Would be a likely Candidate for a business to operate there as well as Potentially some kind of small marketplace with food You know we We'd be open to suggestions, but we're trying to target local businesses and in who is situated at that site

[Speaker 57] (2:50:00 - 2:50:10)
Joy, would you mind? Forgive me director. I'd wet that would you mind talking in the context of Sepata apartments?

And and what that's meant for the local community in which that that's in now.

[Speaker 33] (2:50:10 - 2:50:48)
I think we developed Sepata apartments of right right in the moment of the the dive and housing and It meant a lot to people in the neighborhood because Housing prices were soaring at that point and people were being that was the I think not the beginning but certainly a moment that was deeply felt by The displacement of people out of the community and Sepata apartments has provided 62 units of affordable housing for people in the Logan Square area and has given them some stability

[Speaker 1] (2:50:49 - 2:50:52)
Thank you, those are the questions that I had. Thank you. Thank you all graduations.

[Speaker 11] (2:50:52 - 2:52:51)
Thank you alderman alderman CTO Lopez Thank you chair, and I also want to Second my colleague Mike about the importance of creating more affordable housing across the city with Is unequivocal that we have a shortage a massive shortage of affordable housing to succeed projects like this? I think is It is encouraging to see that there will be There are still projects out there and organizations that are carrying this mission Obviously when I want to make sure that like my colleagues said right that we we encourage the different perspectives I think projects get better and improved when there's more community participation and it seems like that has been the case We not all always have to agree on everything, but we do have to Make sure that we that we realize the big picture and the big picture is that we do not have enough Family-oriented development, especially affordable family-oriented development across the city.

That's a fact I think over the last 10 years the thing as a city we created Maybe dozens dozens of units for affordable housing for unit for families So yes, of course, there will be issues that today just before this project was presented in my own community We had dissent based on density and parking and other issues That we will address but I think I want to make sure that we reassure and I think we heard from the Department of Planning We have we heard from the housing commissioner directly that the proper channels the viability feasibility Channels have been have been followed and there was a community process as well My only question I have because I think there's a sometimes often a misconception that these things happen very rapidly In my opinion, it takes way too long sometimes to actually make them happen So, can you tell us can you just maybe tell us how long has these been this project took place? And how long has been the community process?

[Speaker 33] (2:52:52 - 2:53:14)
the meeting took place in 2014 the series of meetings hosted by MPC Bickerdyke submitted an application in 2016 and What has been working on it? basically Nonstop since 2016 and really I'm the conceptual piece of it from 2014 through the application It's been a long road.

[Speaker 11] (2:53:15 - 2:53:32)
Yeah, and well, I want to thank you again And I know that there has been obviously different so issues, right? But I think you know, there's there has been accountability There have been a lot of questions checks and balances and that's what makes a good project So that's all the question I have and there's more like this.

[Speaker 1] (2:53:32 - 2:53:37)
Thank you, sir. Alderman Burnett Very much.

[Speaker 3] (2:53:37 - 2:56:44)
Mr. Chairman. I'd like to stand in support of this development bigger. I have several developments in my ward Matter of fact, I inherited an area in my ward with Bickerdyke Initially started building their developments that scattered around And and I'm happy to say You know, although we have scatter site affordable and low-income housing in that community The property value in that community has gone up substantially Matter of fact, their properties are right next door to 1.2 million dollar homes being built next to them. Matter of fact folks aren't afraid to build next to Bickerdyke you know, they They bugging me every day to do a zoning change to build a building next to them over in the Echo Park community this this Organization has actually enhanced the west side of my ward with their development I had to tell people in the community that I'm not moving condos over there.

I'm not trying to push you out That's Bickerdyke moving over there. It's affordable housing because Because the housing because the housing is so beautiful So well maintained the residents the matter of fact the residents that live in their developments are so organized They hold a cap meetings in their building They're very involved in the community They train their people to be involved in the community to get involved and to make the community better This organization a day and one of their developments in my community Overall, I think it's here on Ohio We had gang problems and drug problems. Do you know who's the first one to call me?

About the gangs and the drugs to get them out of the neighborhood and to work with the police is Bickerdyke Not just one person Not just one person the whole development because when they come they come together They do not separate and they work as a body and they work as a group and not only do they encourage Other folks in the community to get engaged and involved like that. They encourage their children They train their children to be Involved in the community and to make the community a better place and to take ownership in the neighborhood Although they are affordable housing residents and low-income residents in the community They act like they own the million-dollar homes in the neighborhood So I would say I would say to this community If you're getting some bigger night housing in your area you are blessed and matter of fact Not not not to hate on my colleague But I'm jealous man. I want some more bigger night housing in my ward.

[Speaker 1] (2:56:44 - 2:57:14)
I support this 100% Thank You Alderman Burnett You got us you got a third career Walter All right Now All right now we're gonna hear from Alderman Ray Lopez as committee member, okay for the record I wore this shirt for you Matt just saying

[Speaker 7] (2:57:18 - 2:59:26)
Good I think it's good afternoon everyone Thank You chairman First and foremost, I want to thank everyone who came out today to make their voices heard What regardless what side you're on?

I wish George Blakemore was here to see this today because I think you know This is democracy This is democracy in action. So first off We'll deal with that later, but thank you for being here But my questions are not necessarily about the merits of affordable housing So I think we all know that affordable housing is a must in this city And then we have to do more my questions actually relate to process my questions relate to If I'm reading things correctly and My office as was noted earlier has been inundated as I believe all my colleagues have been inundated with feelings on either side of this proposal and For the record it never ceases to amaze me just how Engaged people are as we've seen with alderman arena and others when it comes to these matters My Question and I don't know if the law department would like to Finance is still going on. Don't worry My question and perhaps law department can answer is that you know when you see all of the support That's come forward on this matter But you also get letters in particular almost like Roughly two-thirds of the people in the impacted zone who are in opposition to this What recourse do we have to kind of mitigate that question to kind of come to some sort of compromise because I think You know the laundry list of groups and organizations that support this project who are not from the area is fine But how do you answer for those who are directly and most significantly impacted in that?

So if the law department can explain that or who are zoning right now, I Why don't we hear from the attorney on the project?

[Speaker 1] (2:59:26 - 2:59:33)
Why like the city's explanation because I well, we'll get to Well, let's start with that and we'll get to the department.

[Speaker 4] (2:59:33 - 3:01:26)
Okay. Thank you. Well alderman This was a very as I think you heard from joy, this was a very detailed process and There were comments made there were revisions made to the plan throughout that process I Actually think this has been one of the more robust Processes that I've been involved with and this is what I do.

I do a lot of zoning work in Chicago and I think just by the mere fact that you're seeing so many people here people obviously did get a word of The hearings there was a lot of there were certainly a lot of people at the plan Commission and I think the way that the city handles this is to let people come up and you know present their point of view, but I think that maybe what you're missing in this is the fact that what you're seeing is something that developed through a community process and It's obvious that there are a number of people who don't agree with that final compromise proposal but We certainly feel like we have more than enough support from the community We certainly are thankful that we have the support of the alderman and you know at some point It's appropriate to move forward with a project when it has reached a certain critical mass Which isn't to say that the people's concerns are illegitimate. It's just that at some point. I think that Commissioner Navarro said it well Just because the project isn't changed based on your concerns doesn't mean you're not being heard It's it's time to move a project forward we think this is a very very good project for the neighborhood and the city of Chicago and We stand by the public process.

I think it was excellent.

[Speaker 1] (3:01:27 - 3:01:34)
Let me ask Patrick Murphy. Do you want? Because I think we all the alderman had a question about from our department so

[Speaker 35] (3:01:35 - 3:01:55)
I'm Patrick Murphy with the Department of Planning so Alderman To answer your question I mean there is a process and one of the speakers alluded to it earlier by handing in a set of petition signatures It's validated if that is validated through the through the city clerk's office to meet the requirements of the ordinance Then it would be up to a council vote to act on that protest at the next City Council

[Speaker 7] (3:01:55 - 3:02:13)
So as far as that potential process would go Does that mean does that mean that the committee needs to wait until that process finishes or it just proceeds forward and then Before it's released as it's released from the committee a different voting threshold would be in effect, correct?

[Speaker 35] (3:02:13 - 3:02:28)
It has to be released from committee first in order to enable the full council to vote and then they could vote on The protests provided the clerk affirms that it meets the requirements So if what they submitted meets the approval of the clerk, then it can be voted on by council once it's out of committee

[Speaker 1] (3:02:29 - 3:02:33)
Okay, all right point of clarification Alderman Beal

[Speaker 22] (3:02:39 - 3:02:51)
But I think for clarification he's asking once it comes out of committee and goes before the City Council Does that ratification from the clerk's office? Put things on hold before it is voted on by the full City Council

[Speaker 7] (3:02:53 - 3:03:26)
No, I just want to make sure so assuming this comes out of committee today and obviously there's a number of Protest slips that have been submitted and we're pending the ratification as you said by the city clerk At the next City Council meeting where this would presumably be introduced as being put out of committee does it have to wait for the clerk to make that ratification before it's allowed to be presented out of committee or Can you do you move forward just knowing that you have to meet the threshold regardless?

[Speaker 35] (3:03:26 - 3:03:46)
No So the determination would have to be made by the clerk and then if it meets the criteria there would be a vote on the protest itself Separate and apart from the vote on the actual project So we would first have to find out from the clerk if it meets the threshold Then if it does council can consider the protest of the overall application, but can't do either until it leaves committee

[Speaker 7] (3:03:48 - 3:03:54)
So it would be reported out But we're still waiting for the clerk to make a decision on

[Speaker 35] (3:03:54 - 3:03:58)
Yes, I'll follow up with committee and clerk after the hearing today

[Speaker 7] (3:03:58 - 3:04:04)
So what would that time like timeline look like for this project because obviously there's a number of individuals Trying to figure out how soon this will be moving forward

[Speaker 35] (3:04:04 - 3:04:20)
I well I'll have to talk to the clerk's office this afternoon to see the completeness of what was submitted and if that meets the criteria as far as the adjacency to the property to the subject property and the percentage of Property owners that had to have signed the petition in order to make it valid and the timeline that had to be submitted

[Speaker 1] (3:04:20 - 3:04:30)
Okay Thank You Alderman We have Alderman La Spada as the last speaker before These Alderman Carlos Rosa will close

[Speaker 10] (3:04:32 - 3:06:15)
Thank you so much chairman. So I Long before I was alderman. I had the pleasure to be at that process back in 2014 the beginning of this community planning process.

My hair was jet-black at the time Even then the vast majority of folks were saying that what you see in front of you today My esteemed colleagues is what we wanted to see developed on this site That we wanted a hundred percent affordable housing and transit oriented development too often when we do TOD the last people that we think about are working families and I'm glad to see a project that turns that equation turns those priorities on its head and then We spent the next few years marching for this project and protesting and petitioning for this project to Talk about the idea of a rushed process is the furthest thing from the reality of what we're doing here. I got a Echo this microphone. I where's it's my colleague.

I need to Really support the jealousy of My colleague Alderman Burnett here that this is exactly the type of project I wish we were seeing bringing to the first ward But that is why I was glad to sign my full support for this zoning change For the tiff dollars that it's going to take to make this project happen. I Need you to really understand that this is exemplary of the kind of equitable transit oriented development and the equitable development We need to see across the city and I really urge your strong and full consideration of this project.

[Speaker 56] (3:06:15 - 3:06:44)
Thank you I'm going to congratulate my colleague from the 35th Ward and and thank Bickert that we're thinking about the community as well as you do but Move a little further west and you'll be in the 30th Ward We'll support you as well.

[Speaker 5] (3:06:44 - 3:13:15)
But thank you and congratulations on this Carlos Absolutely Thank you so much chairman Tunney I've distributed to the committee members a seven-page report that details the extensive community process That has gone into developing this proposal And I'd like to provide one to the committee for the record Excellent. So as you'll note in the report this process began in 2014 with a process led by the Metropolitan Planning Council and that process through a series of three community meetings online Polls text polls asked Logan Square residents. What would you like to see happen at this underutilized?

City owned parking lot just steps from the entrance to the Logan Square blue line and the number one thing that the community Identified time and time again was affordable housing affordable housing affordable housing It is no secret that I campaigned on a pledge to turn that city owned lot into affordable housing and after my election victory in 2015 I was approached by a number of individuals that were interested in developing that lot and Only one Developer came forward with a plan to put affordable housing there And so I said well if you want my support you need to win the community support and so bigger Dyke redevelopment corporation beginning in 2016 worked with Logan Square community groups namely Logan Square Neighborhood Association and Logan Square Preservation To refine this proposal. I cannot tell you how many times they changed architects and change designs on this building But it was a lot There were community members that wanted to see 200 units of affordable housing there to want it to see.

Yeah, I agree with that, too That wanted to see you know more three-bedroom units there ultimately because of the financing ultimately because of Compromise and listening to all the different voices in the community We landed at the proposal that we have here today One that has the support of Logan Square Preservation one that has a support of Logan Square Neighborhood Association one that has a support of Logan Square Chamber of Commerce and I've included letters of support from those three organizations in the back of this letter As part of this process we also had a very well attended community meeting over 600 people attended and at that meeting at the end of the meeting we tallied the comment cards that were submitted and that tally was witnessed by Logan Square Preservation, Logan Square Neighborhood Association and a group that was formed by individuals that are here today to oppose this project Logan Square Neighbors for Responsible Development and The tally of those comment cards that were witnessed by groups that both support the project and oppose the project Found that of the ones that submitted comment cards 351 were in support 35 were in support with conditions and a hundred and thirteen opposed So by a spread of more than three to one the community supported this project we then went through the comment cards and looked at the Addresses that were provided on those comment cards and again by a spread of three to one from 35th Ward residents Who gave addresses and gave comment cards we had a hundred and four in support and 31 in opposition My office continued to receive public input for a two-week period following that community meeting and on the next page of the packet that you have you will see a map that details all of the feedback that my office received via email via online petition via Card submitted to the office via letter submitted to the office and what you will see there is a sea of green of Individuals saying we want this project to move forward.

We want to see this here And you can actually go to my website aldermancausers.org And there's an interactive map and you can zoom in and see exactly where the support for this project is coming from But as you can see the black line is the boundary of Logan Square. The red line is the boundary of the 35th Ward There is an overwhelming sense of urgency and support for this project People want to see it move forward and in the end my office received feedback from about 1,500 individuals we received feedback from about 1,200 plus individuals that provided addresses and of those individuals that provided addresses the vast majority of them lived in Logan Square and in the 35th Ward and the vast majority of them supported this project So I think that the vast support that we see for this project speaks to one The necessity to take immediate action to address displacement and affordability and segregation in the community To it speaks to the tremendous amount of work that Bickerdyke and their architect Landon Boone Baker put into crafting this proposal a Proposal that is respectful That's a compromise that speaks to the needs of the neighborhood and to the community and responds to the surrounding built environment I don't want to belabor the point But I think ultimately, you know This process was looked at by streets blog reporter Linda Lopez and she said it's the most thorough process She's ever seen and our process as a whole in the 35th Ward was looked at by the Shriver Center on poverty Law and they said that it's a process that fosters respect diversity and inclusivity across all demographics I'm very proud that our housing commissioner has spoken in support of this project of the Department of Planning and Development At the Community Development Commission very proud that our new Department of DPD Commissioner Maurice Cox called this a textbook example of what we need to be doing as a city to address segregation So I'm very proud that our community is supports bringing 50 CHA units to the Logan Square blue line so that we can bring And integrate our community I'm very proud that our community supports bringing 50 units that will be affordable to people within 60% of the AMI and that Bickerdyke is going to work with Local schools with community groups to make sure that families that are facing Displacement in the neighborhood have an opportunity to apply for those units and live there for generations to come So I ask this committee's favorable support for this ordinance and I just want to thank every single person from the city level From C dot who also was very integral in working with this from Bickerdyke staff to all of the community members Logan Square Neighborhood Association And of course DPD the new Department of Housing for just all the amount of work for Kolda for all of her work that she's been Doing on this joy Just thank you.

Doug Williams of West Chesterfield Community Association I Was asked to come down and speak about this issue My household Which has resided in West Chesterfield for the entirety of my life over four decades We are against the proposed SF dash one residential single-family detached zoning change for the CTA stage area It is the a dash B 501 is not in the highest and best use of this land I'm familiar with the community having graduated from Gillespie Elementary School Having done early involvement at Harlan High School and an upper bound alumni from the the Chicago State University My background is horticulture and landscape architecture.

I know a little bit about design. I know parking lots are not the most ideal situation I've designed a few and the fact I've had students who designed some even as recent as the Englewood Square, which is adjacent to the Whole Foods This space needs this community needs a number of other resources We had a Walgreens. It's no longer there my mother aging parents can't get certain pharmaceuticals and other care products We need a restaurant sit down have a real meal not just fast food, which I enjoy on occasion And we need a number of other things in the community not just a parking lot We recently planted over 100 trees from Chicago State University to Gillespie Elementary School A sea of parking would not be the most beneficial use of this space It needs to be mixed use even one of my colleagues who's a recent MacArthur Genius Award recipient and Art Institute graduate where I teach on occasion at the School of the Art Institute Walter Hood would say it should be a hybrid space We need that in most communities not just a parking lot and as a landscape architect We value community input We have a very extensive process unlike other professions and we're proud of that Much like on the emblem that sits behind you it says herbs and Horto, which is city in a garden We want to be sure we have something that's representative of a very positive impact in the community

[Speaker 25] (3:29:00 - 3:29:01)

I've been there since 1978 I'm also a business person in the community I'm really against the proposal B 501 it is not the highest of the best use of this land Then we bag up a little bit if we take a look at the entire community Took a survey West Chester took a survey Beginning as a if you a parking lot Benefit no one except outsiders coming to the community be a parking lot pairs the comparison to the type quantity and quality of transit or development Northside and northwest side of their community. I said here earlier and I looked at the proposal of The last people that came before this committee and the things that they had was conducive to the community if we go down to see a parking Lot does not To improve the community walkability in the area that has no premises Few doctors no banks. No real grocery stores and Real restaurants be a parking lot does not appear to be the highest and the best use of this man So therefore, I'm a guest Thank you.

I am with the West Chesterfield Community Association And I'm also part of the red line extension coalition where I'm a brother directly the red line extension coalition is a group a grassroots group that is advocating the Extending the red line from 95th Street to a hundred and thirty Street. I Am pro pro business and I am for the TOD Transit in order to development that takes place when you add a L station in our area but one of the things that I'm not for is the the parking lot or the a Eight five or one which if I don't believe it's the highest and the best use for that particular land I am for keeping control of Businesses and the hands of businesses and also in the hands of businesses coming into the area, but I'm also I'm also However, I believe in the community having input and whatever these different types of business That's going to come into there making sure that the community is on board with whatever it is that they that's coming into there I am against changing zoning in the area where there are well-established Businesses such that they no longer have any say so and what business may be Rented out in their particular commercial space.

I was part of at one time I had a which I still do have a portion of a six-unit commercial building Located and I won't say what what? but what happened was that the zoning was changed from business to residential and Once that zoning change took place It was impossible for us to rent to businesses simply because they could no longer go downtown and get business licenses so I didn't think it made any sense at all to make changes to a business zone and turning the residential The other thing here is lastly is as we all know small businesses are part of the lifeblood of this country in the city a Zoning change to a long-standing business district would be devastating to that district It would be devastating to the business owners any new businesses coming into the area It'd be loss of jobs and the residents that live in the area would lose Businesses that they depend on for goods and services.

Thank you. Thank you very much Sir, yes.

[Speaker 59] (3:36:54 - 3:37:49)
Good afternoon. My name is Samuel B Connor I'm part of the West Chesterfield Community Association I've been a resident at 94 26 soft Wabash for 25 years I Live directly and back of the staging area. So I see and hear everything It is my belief that The CTA staging area should be developed to reflect community input in or the interest The proposed developed area should enhance the millions of dollars already spent on the newly developed redline station at 95th Street Time out for the alderman to haphazardly choose for the community without full community support This is why I'm rejecting the proposed changes by the alderman

[Speaker 1] (3:37:50 - 3:38:01)
Thank you, sir Michael where's Michael and who will be the next speaker? Oh, mr.

Moss.

[Speaker 8] (3:38:01 - 3:43:28)
Okay Good afternoon. My name is Percy Moss and I have been a member of West Chesterfield for 27 years since 1992 built a home in 91st in Michigan and I'm still in that home and part of the reason why is West Chesterfield has always been quote-unquote a black neighborhood who reflected those views it did not participate in West Chesterfield from 95 to 87 it only participated in West Chesterfield 95 to 91st King Drive to State Street and when we were unfortunate Unfortunately transferred from the 6th Ward to the 9th Ward our Problems be gone and they have not let up I have some documentation. I'd like to leave with you and I am here as a former president of West Chesterfield Community Association, and I'm now president of our block club 9100 South Michigan block club and My agenda today deals with three things one Parking lot at 95th. I Say hell no item number two rezoning of 95th and state and 95th to all bash again.

My answer is hell. No and You'll get some reasons My reply in short is let 95th from state to all bash and state to 94th remain as is in 2013 I Submitted a letter of protest to the CTA While they were working on the 95th Street station And it gave them reasons why President Percy Morris of the block club chose Not to accept a parking lot and please read through it and share it with the mayor it states what could be will be and guaranteed to be If you have a parking lot Unsupervised by police You're gonna have gang activity. We have drug trafficking and you're gonna have sexual intercourses in car and Sooner later, they'll start mechanical work.

We are cars are stolen and we have right there under the eye of 95th the other part of parking lot brings drifters purse snatchers and other people and People who live in black neighborhoods are near black neighborhoods will understand exactly what I'm talking about Which means a black mom trying to get to work now has to worry about Someone talking about stick them up. Give me your purse That has not been addressed The third item I say hell no to currency exchange currency exchange Brings the same type of people hanging around as a parking lot They're looking for something to snatch something to grab something to steal something to stick up And who is that? The black people of West Chesterfield.

They're not gonna come from A Portland Park Highland Park in those days. It's West Chesterfield West Chesterfield were created around 1924 and it's always had black people and we have not run away and we ain't running away now and We do have issues by being in the Ninth Ward and I am here Asking the zone in Bullwood To don't change 95th for those reasons Don't have to take my word for the reasons come visit and then Come back later on and see if the same thing is there and my last request. I hope In the future that the Ninth Ward will adopt the philosophy Anytime there's a zone change Change Request made maybe put on referendum and let the citizens vote on it. Not me.

[Speaker 1] (3:43:28 - 3:43:43)
Oh Thank you, sir. You're welcome. You're loud and clear.

All right. I hope yeah, Michael Michaels, yes, sir Good afternoon Chairman Tunney and members of the committee.

[Speaker 9] (3:43:43 - 3:48:29)
My name is Michael Lafargue I am the president of the West Chesterfield Community Association I am the president of the Redline Extension Coalition, and I am a realtor. I am the Chicago's first Honoree as a good neighbor realtor for the National Association of Realtors. We brought national recognition to this neighborhood for the work we do I'm against the proposed SF 1 zoning for what we call the CTA staging area a B 501 is not the highest and best use for this land This is an issue as you can tell of high involvement high interest and participation of our community We are very perplexed why the alderman has not engaged our in community regarding this issue over the last six years But we do think the zoning committee for this notification The community has been plagued by bad business neighbors for many years and since 2012 we have done five surveys of the community and Worked with the developing communities project formed by President Obama the young president Obama the Redline Extension Coalition CTA local communities the 95th Street panel of development and The Metropolitan Planning Council sharing ideas concepts for development of this area our Input is important in August the CTA Announced and the Metropolitan Planning Council started its community input Discussions regarding the developments of the CTA staging area the community demands input Regarding this development of the staging area and is outraged that Since this proposed Zoning change the Metropolitan Planning Council has postponed or canceled its community input discussions Allegedly again due to this proposed zoning change. We have worked hard in 2016 we engaged mayor Emanuel on this issue sending him several documents at least two documents 50 to 50 pages each in 2019 we sent our new mayor mayor live foot 132 page document Regarding the transit oriented development and our community ideas and input in this area at our 2000 at our December 10th 2013 town hall meeting at st. James a enemy church Automobile did attend we do.

Thank you at that meeting The community shared the importance of input and zoning on that in that area And it was discussed that a planned development or planned unit of development will be best in that area and you appear to agree Actually member of our members have a documented in the minutes that you agreed to that plant units allow areas to be developed to the highest and best use using or allowing more creative approaches to development of land Put density setbacks and other land-use regulations that may be adjusted to allow better environments per calls to the alderman bills office statements from his staff State shared that it is that the alderman wants a parking lot to replace this CTA staging area if this is true the community Opposes a parking lot we have these documents for the committee I'll be finished and concluding very soon a parking lot does not Benefit anyone anyone in our community AB501 pales to the comparison of the types quantities and quality of transit oriented development on the north side and northwest sides AB501 does not It does nothing to improve community walkability in an area that has no pharmacies. No doctors. No banks No real grocery stores.

No real restaurants AB501 Does not appear to be the highest and best use of our land With that I make a legitimate appeal to your conscience To vote against this proposed zoning change Vote against a dash B 501.

[Speaker 1] (3:48:29 - 3:48:41)
Thank you very much Thank you, all right, so that is the end of the witness slips on this On this application now, we're going to hear from alderman Beal.

[Speaker 22] (3:48:42 - 3:50:53)
Thank you. Mr. Chairman and members of the community first I want to thank the community for coming down To voice their opinion on this particular zoning change But I want to dispel a couple of things that were stated that are totally false and misinformation has been passed out And communicated through the community. First of all, there's not going to be a parking lot So that is a skit that is being put out there in order to get this to this Just say mr.

Chairman. I've done this, you know, probably 50 times in my career This is a zoning change to protect the community to have a true voice Was there if you leave a zoning? In the Situation that it is in somebody can apply for permits and put something there and you have no control Whatsoever.

So this zoning change is put in Give the community future land plan usage to have an ability to have a voice and if this is not done No one has a voice the alderman nor the committee because if something is zoned correctly Someone can apply for permits and do whatever they want to do Without consulting with already first. So this is a zoning change Make sure we protect future land plan usage and stop giving scare tactics to the community to gain Opposition on things that you don't understand about what's going on. So I'm always protecting the community.

Mr. Chairman That is my first and foremost goal that I've always done and that's what I'm going to continue to do So I introduced not only this ordinance But there's a planning ordinance that I have submitted to start the redevelopment process from 95th States State Street to Cottage Grove and once that ordinance is passed the Commissioner of Planning will be instructed to work with the alderman and the community on What the community wants to see on a stretch of land and not just a corner piece of land Because we don't piecemeal things in the ninth Ward We do holistic development and planning for the best interest of the community So I ask for your favorable vote on this particular ordinance so we can move forward with the planning of my community. Thank you.

[Speaker 1] (3:50:53 - 3:53:22)
Mr. Chairman question No, no. No, we We're not questioning each other. You've had your piece.

We have his piece. We're the committee. We will ask the questions To the alderman from their committee members one piece.

I left all I I have it I have a question just for my own edification And obviously I can't speak for you and your community all of them. I've known you for a long time I don't think any any of us Will sit dormant with a parking lot that is that is not healthy for any community and my question though is This is CTA surplus. So the owner of this property is the CTA Well, okay, so that gets me to another point is that the CTA has one agenda and that's transportation and transportation dollars and Oftentimes they don't involve the community on redevelopment or they let it sit for a long period of time and I'm evidenced of that because I'm my community is the red line red purple line and You know, I know the alderman for years and the city for years have been working on this extension to 130th Street so, you know, I I'm confident that I think the alderman has the interests of the community Long-term and the procedural mechanism that he is instituting if we pass this ordinance is to really give a better control even with the CTA To make sure that his residents have a voice in the redevelopment and I can you know it That's my question, I wanted to make sure it was owned by the CTA and I Don't have any other questions Wait, wait, sir Sir, okay.

You've been outspoken you articulating your plan Okay, let me ask okay, let me give you a question, what's the question we're not going to debate this much further explain the second letter And I'd like to do that now When I did my presentation fine, okay the second letter I gave you copy We're gonna I'm the chairman. It's going to be submitted to the committee. Do you you said you have a question?

[Speaker 8] (3:53:24 - 3:53:41)
Yes So I'm giving you the opportunity for a second bite at the apple on a question, okay My question is what happened to the information that I submitted to the CTA and copies to? Automobile about what should be done.

[Speaker 1] (3:53:41 - 3:54:34)
Well Should be done with what About the problem. Okay. Well that okay.

We don't control the CTA. We control the zoning So I'm sure That the alderman is going to work with you as a community on a redevelopment plan That's not only these subject parcels, but as the alderman articulated is a little bit bigger vision for that. So I wanted to I'm I think that's you know, you might not be satisfied with the process But that's why you're here to come down and talk but I we've given you and the community an opportunity and the alderman is explaining his motivation and his planning process and I believe That the all the alderman will be working very closely with the with the with the neighborhood organization alderman

[Speaker 9] (3:54:34 - 3:54:44)
Thank you so much for your explanation. That's all the community asked. We invite you to our next community meeting We'd like to talk with you.

We haven't seen you in six years.

[Speaker 1] (3:54:44 - 3:54:51)
Okay. Thank you Alright, so I'm before I ask a motion. I'm a alderman Lopez is and has a question

[Speaker 7] (3:54:54 - 3:56:14)
Thank You chairman, that's just more so a statement than a question and it's geared towards the organization, you know I can understand people's frustration But I also know what alderman Beal is proposing is basically what affection was referred to as a down zone to protect the property from being manipulated and I say that because I did the exact same thing along 63rd Street in West Englewood From Damon to Ashton, we had a number of vacant lots a number of zoning Capabilities that would never have engaged the community if we had not changed the zoning Moving forward so that if someone wanted to come in the community could have a say It is a very useful tool to do this because without that You wind up with the dirge of businesses That you don't want the unintended consequences of things come to your community that are in direct opposition to everything that you're advocating even now and I would just say that This tool that we're doing for this area and I think the greater vision that uh, the alderman has expressed Is a good one, but it's incumbent on you to continue To hold him to his pledge, which is what he's committed to.

[Speaker 9] (3:56:15 - 3:56:16)
Alderman, will you visit our next meeting, please?

[Speaker 7] (3:56:19 - 3:56:31)
It's not a challenge to him. It's a challenge to you and the process, but I think moving forward, you know This ultimately in the history of things will prove more beneficial than we're giving credit for at the moment.

[Speaker 1] (3:56:32 - 3:58:05)
Thank you, Jim thank you alderman Lopez and Obviously, you've got the the alderman's commitment to work with the neighborhood organizations on a Redevelopment plan and I know he is good to his word. So Well, and as my staff says he's on record that this will not be a parking lot for long So let's hold him to it, right? So but CTA is its own animal sometimes.

I'll tell you that so With that I'm going to ask Do I have a motion to move to? Move by all Alderman Cardona moves to do pass on this item all those in favor. Aye Okay All right Felix Cardona All right, all those in favor.

Chairman members of the committee. My name is Mark Kupiec. I'm an attorney with offices at 77 West, Washington represent the applicant Nick Dowd who's present and seated beside me and the property's presently Improved with an existing building a one-story commercial building It's vacant the applicants been told may have been vacant for five years or longer Not economically feasible to rehab it The plan is to demolish the existing building and to build a new mixed-use building Which would retain commercial on the ground floor? gentleman's request Nick contacted the Avondale neighbors explained the project and got their support After that, I've been advised that the alderman then sent the application package out to a number of other community groups in the ward for their comment and at that point Nick followed up with the automatic staff and I do believe that the alderman has sent you her letter of support

[Speaker 1] (4:01:43 - 4:02:43)
We have the letter of support on file Questions Again the alderman has a letter of support on on file Can I get a motion to move to pass alderman Haddon moves to pass on this item all those in favor?

[Speaker 2] (4:02:43 - 4:05:53)
Chairman and members of the committee for the record My name is Sarah Barnes, and I'm an attorney with the lobsters of Sam banks Located at 221 North LaSalle Street happy to be here this afternoon on behalf of the applicants and yoga garage LLC Sitting here with me today is the managing member of that LLC and the owner of the yoga studio Bill son as well as our project architect, mr. Seated over to the right The subject property is presently improved with Two one-story industrial buildings one of those buildings as I just indicated is presently improved and operated by Zen yoga studio and the adjacent property is Improved with a one-story Automobile repair shop that is currently vacant the applicant is seeking to undertake a renovation of both of the existing buildings and as part of that renovation to do a Three-story vertical addition above both of the existing buildings all of the newly expanded space will be for the exclusive use and enjoyment of the yoga studio bless you and It's it's clients. They've had great deal of success. It is a local Operated business.

It's had a great deal of success for 10 Five years five years and they've grown so they are just seeking to expand the actual yoga space into Multiple levels there's going to be as you can see from the plans a great deal deal of outdoor space as well and most of the improvements are pushed towards the back of the property so as to not interfere with the pedestrian experience along Milwaukee Avenue Towards that end of this is a transit orient or transit served the location because this is a lifestyle experience most of almost 100% of the existing clients actually take either walk or take other forms of public transportation to the Studio, so as a result, we don't intend to add any additional parking So as to also try and limit the traffic congestion in the neighborhood Since there Milwaukee does tend to get a little bit crowded with that in mind we have Met with and worked actually quite closely with alderman wagons back as well as there are a few residents behind the alley that live Abutting this property. We've met with them and gone over the plans with them as well And we do seem to have Support from all those parties that are interested in the subject property including and the proposal including the local alderman With that in mind, I believe that alderman wagons back tendered some acknowledgement of support to the board or to the committee But we would be happy to answer any questions.

Oh And I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. You're right. Yes, correct.

[Speaker 1] (4:05:54 - 4:06:25)

Yep The ayes have it in the substitute narrative and plans are accepted next Alderman Cardona moves to accept the substitute ordinance all those in favor any opposed Hearing none.

[Speaker 53] (4:06:25 - 4:06:55)
The ayes have it substitute is accepted Yeah, well we should have had the Zen a little earlier in the in the narrative now you show up All right, all the Manhattan It seems pretty exciting and I don't Not fully literate and architectural plans But it appears to be is you mentioned a lot of outdoor space. Is it did I read that right? There's a lot of outdoor space almost on every floor.

[Speaker 2] (4:06:55 - 4:07:33)
Yeah Yeah towards that and I think a lot of the outdoor space and Bill could probably speak to it a little better since he's the owner and also a patron but um is intended for some of the meditation as well as Practice area so to be really unique. You don't see that much in the city at least

[Speaker 1] (4:07:34 - 4:08:52)
Other questions, I think it's a obviously innovative and interesting project and You know, Milwaukee Avenue is one of the most exciting streets in the city I think we had three or four coming up three today and our agenda at least but nothing is Nothing as calming as this one With that being said, I would like a motion to move as amended and with the substitute plans Alderman Cardona Agrees to move it as amended with the substitute narrative and plans all those in favor. Aye any opposed Hearing none the plans and narrative and are accepted and the ordinance will move to the council.

So she could not be here with us today I do ask if you guys have any extra thoughts and prayers that those go out to the levees on this day With that, however, she did want me to proceed with this. It's been a long time coming. We've been working on it for over two years The property is a double-wide Parcel that is currently split zoned half of it is zoned manufacturing and the other half residential our original proposal with which we filed was called for the redevelopment of the property into a single three-story with basement six unit building We worked really closely again with alderman wagus back and some of the residents of the area and it was desired that instead of having One double wide building that they would rather have two side-by-side buildings So two three flats, so as a result the plans have changed and towards that end Subsequent to the filing of the application. We did tender a copy of Some revised plans as well as an amended narrative to the Department of Planning and Development So I would ask that the proposal that gets voted on here today incorporate the substitute narrative and the substitute plans

[Speaker 1] (4:10:37 - 4:10:49)
So alderman hadn't moves to accept the substantive narrative plans for this type one application all those in favor any opposed The ayes have it substitute narrative and plans are accepted

Thank you. So with that the proposal now calls for the construction of two new independent three-story three unit condominium buildings each building will have a Detached garage with off-street parking for three vehicles as well. They are maintaining a good deal of open space in light of some of the other Concerns and issues that we heard from the residents in the neighborhood and We're actually maintaining a height the height of the lower zoning designation, which would be an RT for So with all of those changes to the plans We do have the support of the residents of the neighborhood as well as alderman wagus back again I think he has acknowledged his support to the so the committee members, but I'd be happy to answer any additional questions

[Speaker 1] (4:11:37 - 4:12:59)

Questions from committee members So my only short question is so right now there is no residential

[Speaker 13] (4:17:31 - 4:17:38)
That is correct. It's a two-story building And they're adding a third floor of residential to it.

[Speaker 1] (4:17:38 - 4:18:28)
And there are how many new residential units are six and Then obviously we have it looks like we have 37 parking spaces. So All right other questions Do we need a substitute except the substitute? Okay, so alderman hadn't moves to accept the substitute ordinance all those in favor I any opposed the ayes have it substitute is accepted and now we will We will ask for a motion to pass as amended and revised Alderman Lopez move moves to pass as amended and revised all those in favor.

[Speaker 53] (4:21:19 - 4:21:29)

[Speaker 16] (4:21:34 - 4:21:36)
Top of page two

[Speaker 1] (4:21:39 - 4:22:15)
Okay, what we're going to the top of page two This is Document number a eight four eight nine twenty eighth Ward an ordinance referred in July 24th of 19 common address 2315 through 2345 West Grenshaw Street change request our t4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district to an RT3.5 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district Alderman Irvin Thank You.

[Speaker 29] (4:22:15 - 4:23:34)
Mr. Chairman this our request is in relation to the tri-taylor area there are Four ordinances in total That will deal with the area loosely bounded by Western on the west the Illinois Medical District on the east hair, I'm sorry Congress on the south and Roosevelt Road Congress on the north and Roosevelt Road on the south the desire in conjunction with the tri-taylor Community Association has been to step down the zoning as There's been a desire that The height of Buildings needs to be preserved Where it is as we have our beginning to experience Developers coming in and Building buildings that in our pain are out of the character of the neighborhood so the community is we may had meetings talk to this issue and would like to just step down the Zoning one notch in order to preserve You know two to three unit Fashion versus four unit of buildings and buildings with excessive height in the area

[Speaker 1] (4:23:35 - 4:25:44)
Thank You Alderman Irvin for that explanation And I'm going to read into the record the other applications that are basically the same Thought process for you and your community, and then we can At the same time Okay, all right, so we just heard on the eight four eight nine now We're going to eight four nine.

Oh again in the 28th Ward ordinance referred on July 24th of 19 common address 10 17 South Claremont Avenue and 1004 through 1044 South Oakley RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district again to an R t3.5 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district the next application is number a 849 128 Ward ordinance referred on July 24th of 19 common address 800 through 928 South Claremont Avenue 801 through 929 South Claremont Avenue and 806 through 930 South Oakley again that change request RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district and a b3 to community shopping district all to a RT3.5 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district and then finally in the 28th Ward document number a eight four eight eight 28th Ward ordinance referred again on July 24th of 19 this common address is 932 South Oakley Boulevard and that change request again is from an RT4 residential two-flat townhouse and multi-unit district To a b3 to community shopping district Let's ask for all them and to explain the one on Oakley

[Speaker 29] (4:25:45 - 4:26:35)
Is that right we're going from the 932 Oakley so 932 Oakley is a building that split the building the front half of the building has Taylor Street frontage and this like Sticks off of the building and it has an Oakley address but it's all on one zoning lot is our understanding and so the predominant zoning of the building is that of the Taylor Street zoning which is the product which is really it's really a Taylor Street building that also has an Oakley address Okay, if that makes your your your proposal is RT4 to b3 to because the b3 to is 90% of the building is b3 to in this one little piece of the building is an RT for so it should all be the

[Speaker 1] (4:26:35 - 4:26:38)
b3 to thank you all the men Steve you wanna

[Speaker 6] (4:26:39 - 4:26:45)
Know yeah, the alderman explained exactly right right just cleaning up this portion of the map as long as he's doing this whole neighborhood

[Speaker 1] (4:26:45 - 4:27:18)
Okay, so we'll take all four at the same time. Yes, okay Okay, so we're gonna ask for a motion on the following items Document numbers eight four eight nine eight four nine. Oh eight four nine one and eight four eight eight Do I have a motion?

So moved by alderman Lopez all those in favor I Any opposed then you chair the ayes have it and these four items will be referred out to the full City Council Thank You Alderman. Thank you.

[Speaker 29] (4:27:18 - 4:27:26)

[Speaker 1] (4:27:26 - 4:28:20)
Yes Okay, you guys you guys are doing great work on Claremont That's a thousand block of Claremont Okay, great. Thank you. All right moving back to the first ward on the middle of page 19 Last but not least are we almost?

[Speaker 2] (4:28:21 - 4:29:13)
Good afternoon again, mr. Chairman and members of the committee once more for the record My name is Sarah Barnes, and I'm an attorney with the offices of Sam banks Happy to be here this afternoon on behalf of the applicant G W Logan Square LLC Here with me today is Mitch goals the managing member of that LLC Before I begin mr. Chairman and for the record as a matter of housekeeping This was submitted as a type 1 zoning change application Subsequent to the filing of the application and as a result of some ongoing community review We did make a couple minor modifications to the proposal those were demonstrated in a substitute narrative and a substitute set of plans that were tendered to the Department of Planning and Development prior to this proceeding and as a result.

I would ask that those items.

[Speaker 1] (4:29:14 - 4:29:32)
Please be adopted here for the record So alderman hadn't moves to accept the substitute Narrative and plans for the type 1 application all those in favor. Aye Any opposed? Can you share the ayes have it and the narrative and plans are accepted and before us?

[Speaker 2] (4:29:32 - 4:32:48)
Thank you so much For those of you who are not familiar with the property It is the site of the old store Hollander storage building. It's a five-story Beautiful masonry building that's been there for over a hundred years It was recently vacated and acquired by mr Goltz with the intent to preserve and repurpose the building and time to reactivate the site The site is located on the corner of Milwaukee and Fullerton So it's quite a dynamic site within the first ward and we're excited to bring a new proposal to the neighborhood Towards that end. We actually started this whole proposal With the previous administration so over two years ago it's taken many many different forms over those years and we are Elated to be here this morning with the proposal that you see because I think it's a far better one and one that really melds with the community With that in mind we again we are seeking to preserve the existing five-story building and as part of that There is a vacant site Adjacent there to where we are proposing to do a five-story lateral addition we are working with the Chicago Department of Historic Preservation ie the landmark staff towards the rehabilitation of the building to ensure that we maintain the character of the building As well as the neighborhood while also opening and adding some natural light to the building with that in mind upon completion The newly rehabilitated and expanded building will contain occupiable space for retail Commercial and office uses on and divided between the lower level basement all the way up through the fifth floors There is no residential component to this Proposal which is a little bit unique, but I think with the recent influx in Residential units here in this community that the need was really to find some residential retail and commercial uses for all of the new population in the neighborhood, so With that in mind we are going to provide parking on-site and off-street parking for 16 vehicles no parking is required, but again kind of to try and find a balance between adding traffic to the streets and and also Providing parking for patrons who may not live in the area. We did want to provide some parking This was all a delicate balance that we arrived at after several different community meetings And then working with the alderman as well So with that in mind we have been engaging with the community and the Logan Square Preservation Society towards this proposal as I said as a result of some of those ongoing Reviews we made a couple minor tweaks And we believe that we have the support of the Logan Square Preservation Society as well as a good Portion of the community, but I think Alderman LaSpada has a better touch or pulse on that so I will let him speak

[Speaker 1] (4:32:49 - 4:33:06)
All right so before we hear from Alderman LaSpada we need to pass This what we need to accept don't we need to get a substitute Okay all right it's a long day so we now we can hear from Alderman LaSpada

[Speaker 10] (4:33:07 - 4:34:17)
Thank you so much chairman. I mean it was it was an interesting first Project when you said to me you're at this coffee shop and you're like by the way We've got something interesting planned for the Hollander building But throughout it all Mr. Golt has proven to be a real Collaborator so really working with us through an iterative community-based process Around this development really hearing out and then proving out the interests of the community to see a Transit-oriented development that is so in line with the overall character of the community is very valuable to see Also to see one that is so Grounded in economic development so that we're not just saying as a city We're doing our economic development Downtown everything has to flow that way to bring more economic development out into the neighborhoods is another really great Facet of this project and so we really look forward to seeing this in the community and to See mr. Golt's and the whole development really stay Engaged with us as we move this forward. Thank you.

[Speaker 7] (4:34:18 - 4:34:31)
Thank you alderman Questions for the alderman Alderman Lopez Thank You chairman, what were the changes from one administration to the next you reference there was like yeah, so what were they?

[Speaker 2] (4:34:33 - 4:35:07)
I'd say that's more than slight Yeah the programming Completely changed and that was not just a result of an administration. But just like I said, there's been an influx Of residential development in this particular community and it almost Since we're not sure I don't think yet what that's going to do to the infrastructure there Because some of these buildings are yet to be built out There seemed to be a real need for some more residential based again commercial

[Speaker 23] (4:35:07 - 4:35:51)
We so we started with residential that's the logical Go vertical go apartments, but you know, there's you know sites that are vacant piece of land. That's the obvious Thing to go vertical on the fact that we had a historic building.

It was in great condition for five stories At the busiest inner so identify yourself. Oh, sorry. Mr. Mitch goals GW properties the applicant We thought it was a better opportunity to Capitalize on the strength of the market and do a commercial project at the busiest intersection of Oldman Square on a traffic count is Fullerton and Milwaukee and Tying to the existing building and to bring services and some amenities to the area that are lacking in our opinion today with all the residential boom

[Speaker 7] (4:35:54 - 4:35:58)
So is the vacant property next to it going to be five stories as well, is that one?

[Speaker 23] (4:35:59 - 4:36:10)
Basically in addition, I mean there's a single-story building and parking lot. We'll be getting rid of that We'll be getting rid of the curb cut on Milwaukee Avenue, which is a pea street over here and just doing a you know lateral expansion of the project no no

[Speaker 2] (4:36:11 - 4:36:22)
increase in floors and again because of the historic nature of those The storage building we are working with the Landmarks Committee towards making sure that even the addition the brand new addition

[Speaker 7] (4:36:27 - 4:37:10)
I'm just curious because you know, I had the opportunity of driving down Milwaukee about two weekends ago It was amazing to see how high everything is getting up and down Milwaukee. And at one point, well But it's amazing because it's like at certain points like you're completely in the shade like the Sun is completely blocked out By all of the development up and down Milwaukee Not just in the first ward, but stretching that whole stretch, you know one point you feel like you're in the Grand Canyon I think all I'm in Wagaspac is something that's like a Behemoth half a mile up Whatever that thing is

[Speaker 23] (4:37:12 - 4:37:36)
Historic Street, it's you know on the busiest bike paths in the country and it is historic Canyon pretty soon Well, and well and you know But what's interesting about Milwaukee is you really do go through the middle of a lot of neighborhoods?

I mean you go all the way from River North all the way up to Jefferson Park and it you know There's a lot of streets to go through neighborhoods, but you know, Milwaukee Avenue is the main like Archer on the south side Yeah, it's the main artery for a lot of these neighborhoods

[Speaker 2] (4:37:36 - 4:37:45)
So I can't say too much, but there is an anchor tenant going in here who's going to make very creative use of the five stories

[Speaker 7] (4:37:46 - 4:37:48)
Not Starbucks because they're already done

[Speaker 1] (4:37:53 - 4:37:54)
We're gonna hear from

[Speaker 10] (4:37:54 - 4:38:33)
Ever so briefly because I just wanted to speak into that feedback because you're right like that there has been a real development pattern and I knew that In the first transit oriented development that I approved in the first war that I would really be on me And I think the fact that they're keeping within The heights of the existing structure that they're making such an effort to make sure that the character architecturally is in line With the existing streetscape is really a testament to the thoughtfulness of this development But also a willingness to work with partners like Logan Square Preservation and to earn their trust

[Speaker 1] (4:38:35 - 4:38:55)
Thank you Alderman. And what is the square footage on the commercial? I know but how big it sounds like a very big all commercial project almost 80,000 and I know you're yet to divulge who is an anchor, but are you talking about a multitude of users?

[Speaker 23] (4:38:55 - 4:39:08)
Yeah, the building will have a total of five users We have our anchor user plus two other secured users make up 85% of the square footage in the building. All that's remaining is the ground floor restaurant and retail space Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1] (4:39:08 - 4:39:40)
Thank you on the spot. So I need a motion Do pass on this item? all the Manhattan moves Do pass with the substitute narrative and plans all those in favor.
